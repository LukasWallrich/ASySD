We hypothesize that there is a congenitally altered blood supply of the humeral condyle in some Cocker Spaniels when compared to the blood supply of the humeral condyle in other breeds of dogs, which leads to abnormal ossification between the medial and lateral aspects of the humeral condyle, and predisposes them to fracture and delayed healing.
Microangiography was performed on four Cocker Spaniel and four non-Cocker Spaniel dogs of similar size and weight. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the microangiographs of the humeral condyles revealed a decreased vascular density in the medial, midcondylar and lateral aspects of the condyle in the Cocker Spaniel dogs compared to the non-Cocker Spaniel dogs. This decreased vascular density may play a role in the increased incidence of humeral condylar fractures in the adult Cocker Spaniel dog without any or only minor trauma, and in the delayed healing seen in association with these fractures.},

	abstract = {Background: American Cocker Spaniels are overrepresented among breeds that require surgery as a treatment of end-stage otitis externa. However, the prevalence of otitis externa (OE) in this breed remains unknown. We reviewed the year 2010 medical records of 55 private veterinary clinics in Finland to determine the prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels compared with English Cocker and English and Welsh Springer Spaniels. An American Cocker Spaniel owner questionnaire was designed to identify potential risk factors for end-stage OE.
Results: From the medical records of 98,736 dogs, the prevalence of OE was highest in Welsh Springer Spaniels (149 out of 468, 31.8\%, [95\% confidence interval 27.6-36.0]), followed by American Cocker (89/329, 27.0\%, [22.2-31.7]), English Springer (96/491, 19.6\%, [16.1-23.1]) and English Cocker Spaniels (231/1467, 15.7\%, [13.8-17.6]). The mean number of OE episodes in ear-diseased dogs and the number of ear surgeries were highest in American Cocker Spaniels. Owner questionnaires were received for 151 American Cocker Spaniels, 85 (56\%) of which had suffered from OE. In 47\% (40/85) of these dogs, OE occurred without concurrent skin lesions, 46\% (33/72) displayed the first signs of OE before 1 year of age. In 24\% (20/85) of the dogs, the signs of OE recurred within 1 month or continued despite treatment, 16\% (14/85) required surgery (n = 11) or were euthanized (n = 5; 2 of the operated dogs and 3 others) due to severe OE. The onset of OE before the age of 1 year significantly increased the risk (OR 3.8, 95\% CI 1.1-13.6) of end-stage OE.
Conclusions: The prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland was higher than previously reported in Cocker Spaniels, but the highest prevalence of OE was found in Welsh Springer Spaniels. Compared to the other Spaniels, OE was more often recurrent and more frequently surgically managed in American Cocker Spaniels. Based on the questionnaire, early onset ({\textless} 1 year) of OE increased the risk of end-stage OE. In American Cocker Spaniels, OE requires an intensive approach from the first treatment, and prevention of recurrence should be emphasised. The causes and treatment of OE in this breed warrant further study.},

Ultrasonography revealed kidneys of significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) reduced volume in all dogs. During qualitative evaluation, two different types of sonographic alterations could be seen. In one type of the ultrasound alterations, corticomedullary demarcation was distinct and the renal cortex was remarkably thin, which was best seen in the dorsal (frontal) imaging plane. In the other type of the ultrasound appearance, overall increased echogenicity with poor corticomedullary demarcation was noticed, and the kidneys could hardly be separated from their surroundings. These features were best recognised in the sagittal (coronal) imaging plane. In one dog with secondary hypercalcaemia, a hyperechoic corticomedullary area was also seen. Post-mortem histological diagnosis revealed renal dysplasia and secondary fibrosis. Based on ultrasound findings alone, renal dysplasia (renal familial disease) can be suspected when small kidneys with thin echogenic cortex are present in young dogs. An ultrasound image, similar to that of fibrotic kidneys (increased overall echogenicity and reduced corticomedullary definition) cannot be differentiated from chronic inflammatory disease and from endstage kidneys. Therefore, ultrasound-guided biopsy or post-mortem histology is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of renal dysplasia.

The most common forms of aggression in the ECS were owner-directed aggression (67.6\%), aggression toward unfamiliar people (18.4\%), aggression toward unfamiliar dogs (10.1\%), and aggression toward family dogs (3.3\%). Owner-directed aggression was more common in the ECS than in other breeds, although in similar contexts. In the ECS, the golden coat color was more common in the aggressive dogs than in nonaggressive dogs. ECSs showed impulsive aggression more frequently than aggressive dogs of other breeds. The aim of the study was to analyze cases of aggressive ECSs seen in a referral practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Contraction of the canine infraspinatus muscle was first reported in literature in 1970. Hunting and working breeds are most commonly affected. To our knowledge no previous report describes this pathology in small breed dogs.
Case Report
A 6.5-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was presented to the Small Animal Clinic of the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, for examination of a left forelimb lameness of 6 weeks duration. Abduction of the left forelimb while standing, atrophy of the infraspinatus, supraspinatus and deltoid muscles, pain with palpation and flexion of the shoulder joint and a lameness with outwards rotation of the shoulder were the abnormal clinical findings. Contracture of the infraspinatus muscle caused the lameness, and tenectomy of the infraspinatus tendon resulted in restoration of a normal gait.
Conclusion
Contraction of the infraspinatus muscle is a pathologic entity that has to be considered as a differential diagnosis in small breed dogs with shoulder pain.},

	abstract = {Objective: This retrospective study describes the signalment, clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and mode of inheritance in four young male English springer spaniel dogs with presumptive canine stress syndrome.
Materials and methods: Appropriate cases were located through medical searches of medical records of two large private referral centers. Inclusion criteria comprised of English springer spaniel dogs with tachypnea and hyperthermia that subsequently developed weakness or collapse, with or without signs of hemorrhage, soon after a period of mild-to-moderate exercise. The pedigrees of the four affected dogs, as well as eleven related English springer spaniels, were then analyzed to determine a presumptive mode of genetic inheritance.
Results: Four dogs met the inclusion criteria. All four were male, suggesting the possibility of a recessive sex-linked heritable disorder. Pedigree analysis suggests that more dogs may be potentially affected, although these dogs may have never had the concurrent triggering drug/activity/event to precipitate the clinical syndrome. There was complete resolution of clinical signs in three of the four dogs with aggressive symptomatic and supportive therapy, with one dog dying during treatment.
Conclusion: Dogs with canine stress syndrome have the potential for rapid recovery if treated aggressively and the complications of the disease (eg, coagulopathy) are anticipated. All four dogs were male, suggesting the possibility of a recessive sex-linked mode of inheritance. Further genetic analyses should be strongly considered by those involved with the English springer spaniel breed, either with a genome-wide association study using canine single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays or whole-genome sequencing of affected and closely related dogs.},

	abstract = {Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate if tonometry and gonioscopy could serve as predictors of later glaucoma development in the English Springer Spaniel, a breed prone to developing primary glaucoma.
Animals studied Gonioscopy was performed on 2 79 English Springer Spaniel dogs, It 9 males and 160 females, with clinically normal eves. In addition, 14 dogs, five males and nine females were examined for glaucoma.
Results A positive relation between pectinate ligament dysplasia (PLD) and narrowing of the relative width of the ciliary cleft (RWOCC) and also between PLD, RWOCC and age was demonstrated. The prevalence of PLD was 25.5\%, which is higher than in other breeds reported. A positive association was demonstrated between PLD and glaucoma, as well as between narrowing of the RWOCC and glaucoma. Glaucoma was not observed in dogs with normal appearance of the iridocorneal angle. English Springer Spaniels related to dogs with glaucoma show more narrowing of the RWOCC and more PLD than unrelated dogs.
Conclusion This study demonstrates the positive association between PLD and glaucoma, between narrowing of the iridocorneal angle and glaucoma and the effect of age on the iridocorneal angle. Mating of dogs, with normal iridocorneal angles appears to reduce the presence and degree of abnormal appearance of the iridocorneal angle in the offspring. However, breeding only dogs with normal iridocorneal angles without consideration of their relationship to dogs with glaucoma is not a guarantee for preventing glaucoma in the offspring.},

Methods: Prospective observational study of English Springer Spaniels with no recent history of lameness. Computed tomography scans of both elbows were obtained from dogs older than six months of age which were anaesthetized or sedated for reasons unrelated to this study. Computed tomography scans were reviewed for the presence of IOHC and other abnormalities of the elbow. Radioulnar incongruity (RUI) measurements from normal elbows were compared to elbows with IOHC and elbows with medial coronoid process (MCP) abnormalities.
Results: Computed tomography scans from 50 dogs (100 elbows) were reviewed. The prevalence of IOHC was 14\% (8 elbows in 7 dogs). All condylar fissures were incomplete with a mean length of 2.6 mm. Fifty percent of the dogs (44\% of elbows) had abnormalities of the medial coronoid process and 60\% of the elbows had periarticular osteophytes. Group RUI meansurements for IOHC and MCP were not significantly different from normal elbows.
Clinical significance: Small IOHC fissures, periarticular osteophytes and MCP abnormalities may be identified in English Springer Spaniels without forelimb lameness. Abnormalities of the MCP are more common than IOHC.},

	abstract = {Objective Two pedigrees from the German English Cocker Spaniel population are presented to illustrate the familial occurrence of primary cataract (CAT) in single- and multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The aim was to characterize similarities and differences in the prevalence and formation of CAT in these separately bred color variants of English Cocker Spaniels.
Materials The study was based on the veterinary records for presumed inherited eye diseases of 1232 English Cocker Spaniels which were provided by the German panel of the European Eye Scheme for diagnosis of inherited eye diseases in animals (DOK, {\textless} http://www.dok-vet.de {\textgreater}). Data included information on 615 single-colored and 617 multicolored English Cocker Spaniels.
Results CAT was diagnosed in 92 (14.96\%) of the single-colored and 34 (5.51\%) of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The pedigree of the single-colored English Cocker Spaniels included 40 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 18 unaffected and 22 affected dogs. The pedigree of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels contained 16 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 11 unaffected and five affected dogs.
Conclusions In both color variants of the English Cocker Spaniels different forms of primary CAT with respect to location within the lens occurred among close relatives. Appearance of CAT was very heterogeneous without obvious sex differences. The sample pedigrees do not support the assumption of familial segregation of specific forms of primary CAT in English Cocker Spaniels.},

Fractionated, normal Beagle lens H-crystallins were separated by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. The separated lens H-crystallins were used on immunoblots as sentinel substrates against which the ACS sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against H-crystallins.
ResultsSera from approximately two-thirds of study animals contained antibodies to some H-crystallin polypeptides, but reactivity varied among patients. Contrary to some hypotheses, serum antibodies to groups of H-crystallins did not relate to the stages of cataract. However, detailed analysis by two-dimensional immunoblotting and mass spectrometry showed that three spots originating from A1-crystallin were detected only in sera from cataract patients.
ConclusionSerum antibodies to A1-crystallin may be associated with the development of cataract.},

Retrospectively, 43 client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, older than 1 year of age, with magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation were enrolled. Initial and follow-up (up to 36 months) clinical status was graded. Images were reviewed to quantify the enlargement of lateral ventricles, evaluate ventricular symmetry, grade of Chiari-like malformation, grade of syringomyelia and medullary kinking index. Cases presenting epileptic seizures during the evaluation period were also recorded. The most common initial clinical signs were scratching and neck pain. Ventriculomegaly was identified in 70\% of dogs, Chiari-like malformation grade 2 was observed in 77\% of cases, ventricular asymmetry and syringomyelia were identified in 54\% and 80\% of dogs, respectively; the median medullary kinking index was 37.77\%. Moreover, 28\% of dogs presented epileptic seizures. No significant association was identified between dimension of lateral ventricles and signalment, clinical signs, and imaging findings; no significant association was identified between ventriculomegaly and epilepsy (P {\textgreater}= 0.05). In conclusion, the prevalence of ventriculomegaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels is high but this finding does not seem related to the severity of clinical signs, presence of Chiari-like malformation, syringomyelia and craniocervical junction abnormalities such as medullary kinking.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE. We determined whether naturally-occurring lenticular myopia in English Springer spaniels (ESS) has a genetic component.
METHODS. Streak retinoscopy was performed on 226 related ESS 30 minutes after the onset of pharmacologic mydriasis and cycloplegia. A pedigree was constructed to determine relationships between affected offspring and parents. Estimation of heritability was done in a Bayesian analysis (facilitated by the MCMCglmm package of R) of refractive error in a model, including terms for sex and coat color. Myopia was defined as {\textless}= -0.5 diopters (D) spherical equivalent.
RESULTS. The median refractive error for ESS was 0.25 D (range, -3.5 to +4.5 D). Median age was 0.2 years (range, 0.1-15 years). The prevalence of myopia in related ESS was 19\% (42/226). The ESS had a strong correlation (r = 0.95) for refractive error between the two eyes. Moderate heritability was present for refractive error with a mean value of 0.29 (95\% highest probability density, 0.07-0.50).
CONCLUSIONS. The distribution of refractive error, and subsequently lenticular myopia, has a moderate genetic component in ESS. Further investigation of genes responsible for regulation of the development of refractive ocular components in canines is warranted.},

However, the mechanism by which SM develops in this breed has not been fully elucidated and the associated effects on spinal cord structure have not been reported previously. The aims of this study were to describe changes found in the spinal cord of CKCSs, to compare findings between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and to determine whether syrinx formation was associated with tissue destruction. Anomalies of the central canal were found in all specimens and many dogs had grossly visible fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord. Prominent microscopical findings were spongy degenerative changes associated with neuronal necrosis and Wallerian degeneration. The ependyma was discontinuous in many specimens, notably in symptomatic individuals, and there was evidence of angiogenesis and fibrous tissue proliferation around blood vessels adjacent to syrinx cavities. Compared with two different samples of the normal dog population, dogs with syrinxes had significantly less grey matter, although this decrease was associated with generalized loss of spinal cord area. Therefore, SM is associated with degenerative changes in the spinal cord and may develop through primary disruption of ependymal integrity followed by vascular hypertrophy and proliferation. Glial and fibrous proliferation appears to be associated with expression of clinical signs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Only two of these dogs were radiographed specifically for investigation of the temporomandibular joint, although varying degrees of dysplasia were identified in all dogs where the joints were adequately visualized (n = 20). The head of four CKCS cadavers was also radiographed, and similar changes were found. This finding suggests that temporomandibular joint dysplasia is a widespread asymptomatic condition in the CKCS and should be regarded as a normal morphologic variation rather than a pathologic anomaly. Subtle changes are best seen on lateral oblique radiographs, although marked changes are also visible on dorsoventral views. The rotational angle or angle of articulation of each of the dysplastic mandibular condyles was measured and was related to the severity of the dysplastic changes. However, there was overlap between the values calculated for these abnormal joints and normal ones in other breeds, suggesting this measurement was of limited significance and the shape of the components of the temporomandibular joint are more relevant when assessing this joint for the presence of dysplastic changes.},

Myxomatous mitral valve disease is the most common acquired cardiopathy in dogs. The earliest onset and the highest incidence of the disease is found in cavalier King Charles spaniels. Previous studies have suggested a polygenic inheritance of the disease in this breed. Here, we aim to expand the knowledge of the genetic basis of early-onset myxomatous mitral valve disease in cavalier King Charles spaniels. The selection of cases and controls is a crucial point of the study and is based on clinical, echocardiographic, and genealogical examinations. We perform three complementary genomic analyses that have never been used for investigating this pathology to identify 10 genes differentiating the genomes of the two groups. After examining these genes, we conclude that HEPACAM2, CDK6, and FAH (which are also related to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway, probably associated with the development of the disease) are the ones that are most likely involved in the pathogenesis of myxomatous mitral valve disease.
Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) show the earliest onset and the highest incidence of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Previous studies have suggested a polygenic inheritance of the disease in this breed and revealed an association with regions on canine chromosomes 13 and 14. Following clinical and echocardiographic examinations, 33 not-directly-related CKCSs were selected and classified as cases (n = 16) if MMVD was present before 5 years of age or as controls (n = 17) if no or very mild MMVD was present after 5 years of age. DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyped with a Canine 230K SNP BeadChip instrument. Cases and controls were compared with three complementary genomic analyses (Wright's fixation index-F-ST, cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity-XP-EHH, and runs of homozygosity-ROH) to identify differences in terms of heterozygosity and regions of homozygosity. The top 1\% single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and mapped, and the genes were thoroughly investigated. Ten consensus genes were found localized on chromosomes 3-11-14-19, partially confirming previous studies. The HEPACAM2, CDK6, and FAH genes, related to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway and heart development, also emerged in the ROH analysis. In conclusion, this work expands the knowledge of the genetic basis of MMVD by identifying genes involved in the early onset of MMVD in CKCSs.},

Myxomatous mitral valve disease is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are particularly susceptible to this disease, which generally appears earlier in life than other breeds, resulting, in some cases, in congestive heart failure and death. We hypothesised that within the elderly Cavalier King Charles Spaniels population, there is a sub-cohort of myxomatous mitral valve disease-affected dogs that do not have chamber enlargement. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence and the degree of cardiac chamber enlargement associated with the disease in a population of aged Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and to assess the effect of age, gender, and body weight on echocardiographic status. A total of 126 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels aged over eight years old were prospectively included in the study. On echocardiographic examination, 100\% of them were diagnosed with myxomatous mitral valve disease; 55.6\% of them presented chamber enlargement, and 44.4\% did not. Age was significantly associated with the presence and the severity of cardiac chamber enlargement and mitral valve prolapse. Our results showed that a proportion of elderly Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with confirmed myxomatous mitral valve disease did not undergo advanced stages of this pathology.
Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. It varies from dogs without clinical signs to those developing left-sided congestive heart failure, leading to death. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) are particularly susceptible to MMVD. We hypothesised that within the elderly CKCS population, there is a sub-cohort of MMVD-affected dogs that do not have cardiac remodelling. The objectives of the present study were (i) to determine the prevalence and the degree of cardiac remodelling associated with MMVD; and (ii) assess the effect of age, gender, and body weight on echocardiographic status in a population of aged CKCSs. A total of 126 CKCSs {\textgreater}= 8 years old were prospectively included. They all had a physical and echocardiographic examination. A systolic murmur was detected in 89\% of dogs; the presence of clinical signs was reported in 19\% of them; and echocardiographic evidence of MMVD was described in 100\%.

Body weight, age, sex and recorded diagnoses of 854 Cocker Spaniels admitted to the teaching hospital, over a four-year period, were recorded from medical records. Dogs with a diagnosis of HCF (n = 21) weighed significantly more than the general population of Cocker Spaniels seen at the hospital over the same time period. Dogs with CCR (n = 20) were likely to weigh more than the general population. Whereas, dogs with IVDD (n = 47) weighed less than the general population of Cocker Spaniels. From these results, we concluded that body weight is a predisposing factor for HCF in Cocker Spaniels: that there is a tendency for Cocker Spaniels with CCR to be heavier than the general population and that being overweight does not predispose them to IVDD.},

The results show that serious, repeated growling is the most pronounced single behavior characterizing the aggressive ECS, and this seems to be the most important behavior causing owners to classify their dogs as aggressive. The other main behavior characteristic of the aggressive group was skin-penetrating bites. Snapping and "biting in general" were also frequently reported among these dogs.

	abstract = {Simple Summary
The incidence of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is particularly high in some breeds such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) with as many as 90\% developing this pathology by the age of 10 years. Our study shows that the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) B1 class included extremely different animals. These subjects had significant variability in terms of age (from 6 months to over 11 years), presence and severity of regurgitation and prolapse of mitral valve, as well as presence and intensity of heart murmur. It would therefore seem that in this breed the pathology can essentially follow two different paths: some dogs remain in ACVIM class B1 for a long time (they have a slow progression and persist in class B1 until old age); in others the disease establishes early and progresses rapidly, until it yields symptoms of heart failure even before 8 years. It would therefore be useful to understand whether there are parameters that can early distinguish these two groups.
This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to: (1) characterize echocardiographic features of mitral valve in MMVD affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), focusing on dogs classified as American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) class B1; (2) compare echocardiographic data in ACVIM B1 dogs divided on the basis of age at time of MMVD diagnosis, in order to understand if different aged subjects had different echocardiographic patterns. Length (AMVL), width (AMVW) and area (AMVA) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, mitral valve prolapse, diameters of the mitral valve annulus in diastole (MVAd) and systole (MVAs) of 90 CKCS in different ACVIM classes, 64 of which in class B1, were measured. Valvular measurements were indexed to body weight using Wesselowski's scaling exponents. The presence of heart murmur did not discriminate between A and B1 classes (p = 0.128). Heart enlargement was more frequent in males (r(2) = 0.07, p = 0.013). Within class B1, older subjects showed significantly higher values of AMVA, AMVW, MVAd, MVAs and lower sphericity index (SI). Since many CKCS with MMVD have no murmur and their mitral valve has peculiarities, a specifically designed echocardiographic screening should be realized. In addition, different aged B1 dogs have different echocardiographic patterns that may imply different genetic and prognostic profiles.},

This analysis suggests that familial occurrence of mitral valve murmur in the CKCS breed is not due to a single major gene effect, indicating that breeding strategies to eliminate the disease cannot be based on genotype information at this time.

	abstract = {Background Lobular dissecting hepatitis (LDH) is a rare form of canine liver cirrhosis that may be accompanied by portal hypertension in American Cocker Spaniels. In human patients with liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication. However, PVT has not been reported in dogs with LDH. Herein, we describe the long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel with LDH. Case presentation An 8-year-old neutered male American Cocker Spaniel presented with a 1-month history of severe abdominal effusion. The dog was histopathologically diagnosed with LDH and treated with low-dose prednisolone on day 14. On day 115, computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the portal vein. Therefore, the dog was subcutaneously administered with the anticoagulant dalteparin, and low-dose prednisolone was continued. As a follow-up for PVT, CTA examinations were performed on days 207, 515, 886, and 1168, and the dog's antithrombin and D-dimer levels were measured. Following anticoagulant therapy, the dog was confirmed to have gradually increased antithrombin activity and decreased D-dimer concentrations. In addition, although the thrombus was confirmed to be in the same area of the portal vein system by CTA, atrophy and increased CT values due to organization were observed during the follow-up period. The dog's condition remained stable without clinical signs until day 1112 when it developed hepatic encephalopathy. The dog died on day 1208. On postmortem examination, histopathologically, the liver showed marked bile duct hyperplasia and fibrosis with chronic thrombus in the portal vein. Conclusions This case demonstrated that low-dose glucocorticoid combined with dalteparin allowed long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel with LDH.},

Male cocker spaniels were at increased risk (P {\textless} .001).  Cocker spaniels had more bilateral HCFs than other breeds of dogs (P {\textless} .001).  Eighteen dogs (17 purebred spaniels and 1 crossbred spaniel) with HCFs of unknown cause or occurring with normal activity were f further studied, using radiography of their humeral condyle bilaterally (n = 18), computed tomography (n = 3), biopsy (n = 2), bone scintigraphy (n = 2), and genetic evaluation (n = 8).  Fourteen of these 18 dogs had a nonfractured contralateral condyle.  Twelve (86\%) of the 14 nonfractured humeral condyles had a radiolucent line within the center of the condyle, 13 (93\%) had radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease and an abnormal medial coronoid process, and six (43\%) had periosteal proliferation involving the lateral epicondyle.  Examination of biopsy samples from the fracture sites of two cocker spaniels showed fibrous tissue present at the fracture surfaces.  The results of this study suggest an association between incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in cocker spaniels and Brittany spaniels and a high prevalence of HCFs.  Eight affected cocker spaniels with available pedigree information were found to be genetically related, suggesting that incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle may be a genetic disease with a recessive mode of inheritance.

	abstract = {Aggression is one of the most common behavioral problems in dogs and may have important negative effects on public health, human animal bond, and animal welfare. There is ample evidence showing a negative correlation between serum serotonin concentration and aggressive behavior in a variety of species, including the domestic dogs. This negative correlation is particularly pronounced in dogs that show impulsive aggression. Data obtained in some previous studies suggest that the English cocker spaniel (ECS) is more likely to show impulsive aggression than other breeds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze possible differences in serum serotonin levels between aggressive ECS and aggressive dogs of other breeds. Nineteen ECSs presented for aggression at the Animal Behavior Service (School of Veterinary Science, Barcelona, Spain) were evaluated and compared with 20 aggressive dogs of other breeds attended at the same center. Serum serotonin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 15.0 for Windows. Aggressive ECSs had significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) lower levels of serum serotonin than aggressive dogs of other breeds (318.6 +/- 67.1 and 852.77 +/- 100.58 ng/mL, respectively). Variances were not significantly different between ECSs and other breeds (standard deviation = 449.84 ng/mL vs. 292.47 ng/mL, P {\textgreater} 0.05). This finding may explain why ECSs are more likely to show impulsive aggression than other breeds, and suggests that the ECS could be a good model to study the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying impulsive aggression.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and the entire spinal cord of 49 dogs was performed and different morphological parameters compared.
Syrinx formation was present in the C1-C4 region and in other parts of the spinal cord. The maximal dorsoventral syrinx size can occur in any region of the spinal cord and the total syrinx size was positively correlated with age. Seventy-six per cent of CKCS with a cranial cervical syrinx also have a syrinx affecting more caudal spinal cord regions. MRI restricted to the cervical region may underestimate the extent of SM and the severity of the disease process in the majority of dogs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Many Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs are affected by an autosomal recessive dysplasia of platelets resulting in fewer but larger platelets. The IDEXX Vet Autoread (QBC) hematology analyzer directly measures the relative volume of platelets in a blood sample (plateletcrit). We hypothesized that CKCS both with and without hereditary macrothrombocytosis would have a normal plateletcrit and that the QBC results would better identify the total circulating volume of platelets in CKSC than methods directly enumerating platelet numbers.
Objectives: The major purpose of this study was to compare the QBC platelet results with platelet counts from other automated and manual methods for evaluating platelet status in CKCS dogs.
Methods: Platelet counts were determined in fresh EDTA blood from 27 adult CKCS dogs using the QBC, Sysmex XT-2000iV (optical and impedance), CELL-DYN 3500, blood smear estimate, and manual methods. Sysmex optical platelet counts were reanalyzed following gating to determine the number and percentage of normal- and large-sized platelets in each blood sample.
Results: None of the 27 CKCS dogs had thrombocytopenia (defined as {\textless} 164 x 10(9) platelets/L) based on the QBC platelet count. Fourteen (52\%) to 18 (66\%) of the dogs had thrombocytopenia with other methods. The percentage of large platelets, as determined by regating the Sysmex optical platelet counts, ranged from 1\% to 75\%, in a gradual continuum.
Conclusions: The QBC may be the best analyzer for assessing clinically relevant thrombocytopenia in CKCS dogs, because its platelet count is based on the plateletcrit, a measurement of platelet mass.},

	abstract = {Background
American Cocker Spaniels are predisposed to chronic hepatitis.
Objective
To describe the clinical and histological features of chronic hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels.
Animals
Thirteen cases examined from 2003 to 2009.
Methods
Retrospective study. Medical records were searched for American Cocker Spaniels with chronic liver diseases. History, physical examination, clinicopathologic features, hepatic ultrasonographic findings, hepatic histopathology, and immunohistochemistry were evaluated.
Results
The median age was 4.6 (1.9-10.7) years. Clinical signs included inappetence (11/13), ascites (11/13), lethargy (9/13), diarrhea (7/13), and melena (2/13). Only 1/13 dogs was jaundiced. Clinicopathological abnormalities were increased liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase: 9/12, aspartate aminotransferase: 7/10, alanine aminotransferase: 6/13, alkaline phosphatase: 6/13), increased total serum bile acid concentrations (10/12), and hypoalbuminemia (10/13). The liver had an irregular surface in all dogs and acquired portosystemic collaterals were verified in 11/13 dogs by abdominal ultrasound (2), laparoscopy (4), or both (5). Liver histology revealed severe fibrosis and cirrhosis in all cases, subdivided in lobular dissecting hepatitis (7), periportal fibrosis (1), micronodular cirrhosis (3), and macronocular cirrhosis (2). Inflammatory activity was low to mild. Immunohistochemical stains showed ductular proliferation. The median survival time was 913 (range: 63-1981) days.
Conclusion and Clinical Importance
Hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels is clinically silent until an advanced stage and is associated with severe hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, extensive ductular/putative hepatic progenitor cell proliferation, portal hypertension, and acquired portosystemic collateral shunting, but relatively long survival times. Lobular dissecting hepatitis seems more prevalent than in previously reported cases from other countries.},

Data on the cause and development of these breed characteristic histopathological changes are lacking. We performed video-otoscopic examinations and dermatological work-up on 28 ACSs, obtained aural biopsies from each dog and assessed the statistical associations between the presence of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia and disease history, clinical or microbiological findings and underlying cause of otitis externa (OE). Histological lesions of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia were observed in aural biopsies from 6/13 clinically healthy ears and 13/15 ears with OE from 19/28 examined dogs. Nine of 28 dogs had histologically normal ceruminous glands (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-36.6). Bacterial growth in microbiological culture of aural exudate (OR 14.1, 95\% CI 2.1-95.3) was associated with ceruminous glandular changes, whereas previous history of OE, cutaneous findings or underlying allergies were not. Pedigree analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) were performed on 18 affected and eight unaffected dogs based on histopathological diagnosis. While the GWAS indicated a tentative, but not statistically significant, association of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia with chromosome 31, a larger cohort is needed to confirm this preliminary result. Based on our results, ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia may also precede clinical signs of OE in ACSs and a genetic aetiological component is likely Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to verify our preliminary results.

Animals-35 English-bred English Springer Spaniels, 60 American-bred English Springer Spaniels, and 1 affected dog and its parents from a family of English Springer Spaniels in Colorado.
Procedure-Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to amplify the mutated region in the gene encoding alpha-L-fucosidase. High guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the region required use of an amplification buffer with high pH. Mutant and normal alleles were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular genetic lest results were compared with enzyme data.
Results-A 262-bp PCR product was amplified from normal dogs and compared with a 248-bp product from affected dogs. Carriers had 1 copy of each allele, distinguishable by the 14-bp size difference. Two carriers among the English-bred dogs were identified by use of enzyme and genomic DNA analyses. The molecular defect in dogs from Colorado was proven to be the same as that in British and Australian dogs. None of the other 60 American-bred dogs carried the mutant allele.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-A PCR method that can be used to identify dogs affected with or carriers of the autosomal recessive disease fucosidosis was established. Amplification was achieved within a GC-rich region, using a method that may be useful in overcoming amplification problems in GC-rich areas within other genes. Using this test, fucosidosis can be controlled and ultimately eradicated from the English Springer Spaniel population.},

Animals: One hundred thirty-four English Cocker Spaniels (12 with ARHN, 8 obligate carriers, and 114 others), 3 mixed breed dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN), and 7 other dogs without hereditary nephropathy were included.
Methods: Diagnosis of ARHN was based on transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to compare COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA concentrations in the renal cortex from ARHN-affected English Cocker Spaniels, XLHN-affected dogs, and dogs without hereditary nephropathy. The entire coding region of COL4A4 was sequenced in 2 ARHN-affected dogs, 2 obligate carriers, 2 English Cocker Spaniels of unknown status, and 2 healthy mixed breed dogs. The exon containing the mutation was sequenced for all 134 English Cocker Spaniels.
Results: Quantitative real time RT-PCR implicated COL4A4 as the gene harboring the mutation, and sequencing identified a single nucleotide substitution at base 115 as the cause of ARHN in English Cocker Spaniels. This mutation, which causes a premature stop codon in exon 3 of COL4A4, was segregated with clinical status in all affected dogs and obligate carriers. The mutation also was identified in 39 of 114 other English Cocker Spaniels with previously unknown status.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The cause of this disease has been identified, and use of a test for the mutation will permit eradication of ARHN in the English Cocker Spaniel.},

Methods DNA samples from 21 cases/parents were collected. Canine candidate genes (CCGs) for similar inherited human diseases were chosen. Twenty-eight candidate genes were identified by searching the Pubmed OMIM database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim). Canine orthologues of human candidate genes were identified using the Ensembl orthologue prediction facility (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Two microsatellites flanking each candidate gene were selected, and primers to amplify each microsatellite were designed using the Whitehead Institute primer design website (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). The microsatellites associated with all 28 CCGs were genotyped on a panel of 21 DNA samples from CKCS dogs (13 affected and eight carriers). Genotyping data was analyzed to identify markers homozygous in affected dogs and heterozygous in carriers (homozygosity mapping). Results None of the microsatellites associated with 25 of the CCGs displayed an association with CKCSID in the 21 DNA samples tested. Three CCGs associated microsatellites were monomorphic across all samples tested. Conclusions Twenty-five CCGs were excluded as cause of CKCSID. Three CCGs could not be excluded from involvement in the inheritance of CKCSID. Support Kennel Club Charitable Trust grant.},

	abstract = {Objective - To investigate development of femoral artery occlusion in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
Design - Prospective study.
Animals - 954 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
Procedure - 1,750 cardiovascular examinations consisting of visual inspection of mucous membranes, thoracic auscultation in areas associated with the heart valves, thoracic palpation, and palpation of the femoral arteries were made at 10 dog shows on 954 dogs. Findings of clinically normal, weak, or undetectable femoral pulses were recorded. Pathologic changes in occluded femoral arteries of 2 dogs were examined histologically.
Results - Of the 954 dogs, 22 (2.3\%) had an undetectable right or left femoral pulse on 1 or more examinations. Forty (4.2\%) additional dogs had weak unilateral or bilateral femoral pulses. Only 1 dog had exercise intolerance, and it had coexistent congestive heart failure. Histologic examination of serial sections of an occluded femoral artery from 1 dog revealed intimal thickening with breaks in the internal elastic lamina proximal to the occluded segment. The occluded segment of the femoral artery was contracted and filled with an organizing, recanalizing thrombus. Similar histopathologic changes were found in sections of a femoral artery from another dog.
Clinical implications - Femoral artery occlusion is rare in other breeds and is not clinically important in dogs because of adequate collateral circulation; however, its rather common development in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels indicates a genetic predisposition and probable weakness in the femoral artery wall.},

A syndrome similar to Brody disease has been reported in cattle. Reports of a similar syndrome in dogs are scarce. Objectives To define and describe the clinical, diagnostic, and genetic features and disease course of paradoxical pseudomyotonia in Spaniel dogs. Animals Seven client-owned dogs (4 English Springer Spaniels and 3 English Cocker Spaniels) with clinically confirmed episodes of exercise-induced generalized myotonic-like muscle stiffness. Methods Sequential case study. Results All dogs were {\textless}24 months of age at onset. The episodes of myotonic-like generalized muscle stiffness always occurred with exercise, and spontaneously resolved with rest in {\textless}45 seconds in all but 1 dog. Extreme outside temperatures seemed to considerably worsen episode frequency and severity in most dogs. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry including electrolytes, urinalysis, brain magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electromyography, motor nerve conduction velocity, ECG, and echocardiography were unremarkable. Muscle biopsy samples showed moderate but nonspecific muscle atrophy. The episodes seemed to remain stable or decrease in severity and frequency in 6/7 dogs, and often could be decreased or prevented by avoiding the episode triggers. The underlying genetic cause is not identified yet, because no disease-causing variants could be found in the coding sequence or splice sites of the 2 major candidate genes, SCN4A and ATP2A1. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Paradoxical pseudomyotonia is a disease affecting Spaniels. It is of variable severity but benign in most cases.},

The effect of the breeding program was evaluated by comparing the prevalence of heart murmurs in the two groups. In 2007, the prevalence of heart murmurs was 52\% (50\% for females and 54\% for males) and in 2009, the prevalence was 55\% (44\% for females and 67\% for males). No significant difference was found in the prevalence of heart murmurs between 2007 and 2009 (P = 0.8).

	abstract = {The results of ophthalmological examinations of 615 single-colored English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) were used for prediction of breeding values for primary cataract (CAT) and two different age-related forms of primary cataract, i.e. CAT-early and CAT-late. Breeding values (BV) for CAT, CAT-early and CAT-late were predicted using an animal threshold model and Gibbs sampling. Breeding values were then standardized onto a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20. Relative efficiency in reducing prevalence of CAT and CAT-early were compared and we could show that selection based on relative breeding values (RBV) for CAT-early of both parents lets expect the largest relative reduction of prevalence of all forms of CATs considered here. A selection scheme based on sires or dams with RBV for CAT-early of ! 90 would have resulted in a decrease of nearly half of the population mean of 6.67\% in the next generation, while a selection scheme based on sires or dams with RBV for CAT of : 90 would have resulted in a decrease of 2.2\% or 3.6\% of the population mean of 14.96\% in the next generation. In contrast to these results, selection for CAT-late is difficult due to insufficient numbers of ophthalmologically examined dogs at higher ages. However, at the present situation the most effective selection strategy to reduce the prevalence of primary cataract in the German population of single-colored ECS would be to consider all animals affected by CAT, because differentiation in RBVs for CAT-early and CAT-late is less efficient due to the unmeaning RBV for CAT-late.},

Although abnormalities in caudal fossa morphology are considered major contributors to the development of this disease, limited information exists on the range of morphologies in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and on the relationship of these to clinically evident disease. Sixty-four Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were studied. Each underwent a neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and brain. T2-weighted sagittal images were used to determine both the morphologic characteristics and volume of the caudal fossa in each dog. This volume was also analyzed as a percentage of total cranial cavity volume. Each attribute was correlated with neurological grade and presence of syringohydromyelia. Fifteen dogs had neurologic signs, and 59 had morphologic abnormalities of the craniocervical junction. While 27 dogs had syringohydromyelia, 13 of these were clinically normal. Cerebellar herniation and occipital dysplasia were common findings but were not associated with syringohydromyelia. Dorsal compressive lesions were noted at the first and second cervical vertebral junction. Factors associated with the presence of neurologic signs included syringohydromyelia and the ratio of caudal fossa/total cranial cavity volume; dogs with signs had significantly larger syringohydromyelia than asymptomatic dogs. Caudal fossa size was not associated with syringohydromyelia. A positive association was identified between foramen magnum size and length of cerebellar herniation. The prevalence of craniocervical junction abnormalities is high in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. While several factors are associated with neurologic signs, occipital hypoplasia appears to be the most important factor.},

The study was performed over a four-year period, from 2013 to 2017, all cases underwent neurological examination, full diagnostic work-up, including magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain, cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. Thirty-seven dogs were included in this study, 23 females and 14 males, with a mean age of 3.6 +/- 2.1years.
The commonest clinical findings encountered were neuropathic pain and vocalization, seen in all 37 cases, followed by scratching, facial rubbing, paw licking, air licking, tail chasing, seizures and unilateral facial paralysis.
Different grades of cerebellar herniation and cervical syrinxes were noted in all cases, other magnetic resonance imaging findings encountered were medullary kinking, presyrinx and ventriculomegaly.
In establishing the diagnosis of the Chiari-like malformation and Syringomyelia, the breed, clinical history and the symptomatology are very important, but only magnetic resonance imaging technique can provide quantitative assessment of the nervous system lesions.},

Cataracts are one of the most frequent ocular disorders that affects dogs and leads to blindness. In the late stages, lens opacity unables fundoscopy and consequently the diagnosis of retinal degeneration such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which contraindicates surgery. Aiming the return of vision, full field electroretinogram (full field ERG) becomes indispensable before surgery. As English Cocker Spaniels are predisposed to cataracts and retinal degeneration, the objective of this study is the evaluation of the full field ERG records performed in dogs. One hundred thirty-six full field ERGs were recorded from English Cocker Spaniels (62 males and 74 females, with ages ranging from 3 to 15 years old), between September, 2004 and May, 2009. Each examined dog presented cataracts and vision loss before the exam. Diagnosis of retinal degeneration was made based on ERG parameters which were measured from peak to peak amplitude and b-wave implicit time in the 3 different responses (rod response, maximal response and cone response). Amplitude measured in rod, maximal and cone response, as well as the implicit time recorded from dogs that did not present retinal degeneration were respectively: 71.55 mu V/65.15ms; 149.17 mu V/33.03ms; and 31.06 mu V/27.90ms. No response was recorded in 38 dogs. Low responses were recorded from the remaining dogs: 12.88 mu V/65.04ms, 24.16 mu V/36.25ms, and 8.36 mu V/31.38ms. Results showed that 122 animals (89.7\%) presented progressive retinal atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that full field ERG must be performed in English Cocker Spaniels presenting cataracts before its removal due to high incidence of retinal degeneration in this breed.},

	abstract = {Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease in dogs. It is characterized by chronic progressive degenerative lesions of the mitral valve. The valve leaflets become thickened and prolapse into the left atrium resulting in mitral regurgitation (MR). MMVD is most prevalent in small to medium sized dog breeds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) in particular. The onset of MMVD is highly age dependent, and at the age of 10 years, nearly all CKCS are affected. The incidence of a similar disease in humans-mitral valve prolapse-is 1-5\%. By defining CKCSs with an early onset of MMVD as cases and old dogs with no or mild signs of MMVD as controls, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with development of MMVD. We have identified a 1.58 Mb region on CFA13 (P-genome = 4.0x 10(-5)) and a 1.68 Mb region on CFA14 (P-genome = 7.9x 10(-4)) associated with development of MMVD. This confirms the power of using the dog as a model to uncover potential candidate regions involved in the molecular mechanisms behind complex traits.},

Design-Prevalence survey.
Animals-1,053 adult English Springer Spaniels.
Procedure-A mail survey was sent to 2,400 randomly selected owners of adult American Kennel Club-registered English Springer Spaniels. Dogs with a history of aggression to family members and familiar humans were compared with dogs without such a history.
Results-1,053 questionnaires (56.1\% of the 1,877 delivered) were completed. A history of owner-directed growling or more intense aggression was reported in 510 (48.4\%) dogs. Two hundred seventy-seven (26.3\%) dogs had bitten a human in the past; 65.2\% of bites were directed at familiar (owner or nonowner) adults and children. Variables associated with owner-directed aggression included sex of dog (male), neuter status (neutered, regardless of sex), show or bench lines, age {\textgreater} 4 years, aggression to unfamiliar adults and children, acquisition from a hobby breeder, less responsiveness to obedience cues, and a specific kennel and 1 popular sire from that kennel in a 4-generation pedigree.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Owner-directed aggression in adult English Springer Spaniels was associated with a number of environmental, sex-related, and inherited factors. To reduce the risk of aggression, prospective owners might seek a female, hunting-type English Springer Spaniel from an experienced breeder. However, because risk factors are broad and varied, there are limitations to the extent to which behavior can be predicted and further study is needed of the inheritance of aggression in this breed.},

	abstract = {Background: A number of studies have attempted to quantify the relative volumes of the endocranial volume and brain parenchyma in association with the pathogenesis of the Chiari-like malformation (CLM) in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). In our study we examine the influence of allometric scaling of the brain and cranial cavity volume on morphological parameters in different dog breeds. MRI scans of 110 dogs (35 mesaticephalic dogs, 35 brachycephalic dogs, 20 CKCSs with SM, and 20 CKCSs without SM) have been used to create 3-dimensional volumetric models of skull and brain parts. Volumes were related to body weight calculating the adjusted means for different breeds.
Results: There was a strong global dependency of all volumes to body weight (P {\textless} 0.0001). The adjusted means of the absolute and relative volumes of brain parenchyma and cranial compartments are not significantly larger in CKCSs in comparison to brachycephalic and mesaticephalic dogs. A difference in absolute or relative volumes between CKCSs with and without SM after relating these values to body weight could not be identified. The relative volume of the hindbrain parenchyma (caudal fossa parenchyma percentage) was larger in brachycephalic dogs than in CKCSs, without causing herniation or SM.
Conclusion: An influence of body weight exist in dogs, which can be sufficiently large to render conclusions on the difference in volumes of the brain and skull unsafe unless some account of the body weight is taken in the analysis. The results of this study challenge the role of overcrowding for the development of SM in dogs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To assess the anatomic distribution of thoracolumbar and lumbar intervertebral disk extrusions (IVDEs) in English Cocker Spaniels as compared with findings in Dachshunds and to characterize clinical findings in English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar or lumbar IVDEs affecting various regions of the vertebral column.
DESIGN
Retrospective observational study.
ANIMALS
81 English Cocker Spaniels and 81 Dachshunds with IVDEs.
PROCEDURES
Signalment, clinical signs, neurologic examination findings, and affected inter-vertebral disk spaces (IVDSs) were recorded for both breeds. Management methods and outcomes were recorded for English Cocker Spaniels. Lesions were categorized as thoracolumbar (IVDSs T9-10 through L1-2), midlumbar (L2-3 through L4-5), or caudal lumbar (L5-6 through L7-S1).
RESULTS
Midlumbar and caudal lumbar IVDEs were significantly more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds. English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDEs had a longer median duration of clinical signs before evaluation and more commonly had unilateral pelvic limb lameness or spinal hyperesthesia as the predominant clinical sign than did those with IVDEs at other sites. Those with caudal lumbar IVDEs less commonly had neurologic deficits and had a higher median neurologic grade (indicating lesser severity), shorter mean postoperative hospitalization time, and faster mean time to ambulation after surgery than those with other sites affected. These variables did not differ between English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar and midlumbar IVDEs.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Caudal and midlumbar IVDEs were more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds. English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDE had clinical signs and posttreatment responses that differed from those in dogs with midlumbar or thoracolumbar IVDE.},

Materials and Methods Retrospective comparison of English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype with and without taurine deficiency at the cardiology department of a UK academic referral centre between 2008 and 2018.
Results Taurine plasma concentration was available in 16 English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype; 13 of 16 had congestive heart failure and three of 16 did not. Taurine concentration was low ({\textless}50 mu mol/L) in 13 of 16 and normal in three of 16. Deficient dogs received taurine supplementation in addition to conventional cardiac medications. Eight dogs were still alive at the end of this study and eight were dead. MST for all dogs included in the study was 2800 days. Left ventricular systolic function improved and left ventricular dimensions reduced in English cocker spaniels with taurine deficiency following taurine supplementation and conventional cardiac therapy, although similar results were observed in English cocker spaniels with normal taurine concentration on cardiac therapy alone.
Clinical Significance Based on laboratory reference intervals, low taurine concentrations were common in English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy, showing a possible association between dilated cardiomyopathy in English cocker spaniels and taurine deficiency; supplementation with taurine was not curative.},

	abstract = {In her book The Animal Estate, Harriet Ritvo reminds us that animal-related discourse has often functioned as an extended, if unacknowledged metonymy, offering participants a concealed forum for the expression of opinions and worries imported from the human cultural arena. This paper examines one such metonymy in the early modern period: the animal in question is the English dog. Early modern England was often perceived by other nations to be unique in the variety and number of its dogs, and of these the mastiff and spaniel were most celebrated as products of English soil. They accompanied many English ambassadors throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they are mentioned in the annals of the Virginia colony, they were even the only two dogs aboard the Mayflower. The mastiff's courage, strength and ferocity in bull and bear baiting were appealing to those who wanted to advertise English masculine valour, both to themselves and to foreigners, but mastiffs were also criticized for their roughness, stupidity and laziness. Spaniels, the quintessential dogs of the English gentry, were antithetical to the mastiff in almost every respect. Often celebrated for their loyalty and devotion, qualities that made them a model of civility and common interest, devoted spaniels could all too often be described as fawning, showing a false sycophantic loyalty of self-destructive attachment. As a gendered pair, the mastiff and the spaniel record a significant uneasiness about the English national character, caught between barbarism and excessive civility. It is an uneasiness that combines regional climate, including things such as air and ground, and more abstract notions of race or breed as they were demonstrated in the animal world as a whole, and it demonstrates that the emerging discourse of nationality in the early modern period was a much concerned with the natural world as it was with human institutions.},

	abstract = {Background Almost all elderly dogs develop myxomatous mitral valve disease by the end of their life, but the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) has a heightened susceptibility, frequently resulting in death at a young age and suggesting that there is a genetic component to the condition in this breed. Transcriptional profiling can reveal the impact of genetic variation through differences in gene expression levels. The aim of this study was to determine whether expression patterns were different in mitral valves showing myxomatous degeneration from CKCS dogs compared to valves from non-CKCS dogs. Results Gene expression patterns in three groups of canine valves resulted in distinct separation of normal valves, diseased valves from CKCS and diseased valves from other breeds; the latter were more similar to the normal valves than were the valves from CKCS. Gene expression patterns in diseased valves from CKCS dogs were quite different from those in the valves from other dogs, both affected and normal. Patterns in all diseased valves (from CKCS and other breeds) were also somewhat different from normal non-diseased samples. Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed enrichment in GO terms relating to cardiac development and function and to calcium signalling canonical pathway in the genes down-regulated in the diseased valves from CKCS, compared to normal valves and to diseased valves from other breeds. F2 (prothrombin) (CKCS diseased valves compared to normal) and MEF2C pathway activation (CKCS diseased valves compared to non-CKCS diseased valves) had the strongest association with the gene changes. A large number of genes that were differentially expressed in the CKCS diseased valves compared with normal valves and diseased valves from other breeds were associated with cardiomyocytes includingCASQ2,TNNI3andRYR2. Conclusion Transcriptomic profiling identified gene expression changes in CKCS diseased valves that were not present in age and disease severity-matched non-CKCS valves. These genes are associated with cardiomyocytes, coagulation and extra-cellular matrix remodelling. Identification of genes that vary in the CKCS will allow exploration of genetic variation to understand the aetiology of the disease in this breed, and ultimately development of breeding strategies to eliminate this disease from the breed.},

In humans, NeP is associated with anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life (QoL). In this study, databases of three specialist veterinary centres were searched and CKCS breed societies and health forums were contacted to identify CKCS with an imaging diagnosis of CM/SM. Owners completed questionnaires on behaviour, signalment, general health status, NeP and QoL. Data were analysed from 122 dogs out of 564 questionnaires completed, after incomplete questionnaires and data from dogs that had other potentially debilitating disease processes were excluded. NeP severity score was significantly and positively correlated with 'stranger-directed' fear (r(s) = 0.28), non-social fear (r(s) = 0.34), 'separation-related' behaviour (r(s) = 0.38), attachment behaviour (r(s) = 0.24), excitability (r(s) = 0.21) and proxy for pain sensation (r(s) = 0.29). Increased NeP was also significantly associated with decreased QoL (r(s) = 0.47), ability to settle (r(s) = 0.26) and willingness to exercise (r(s) = 0.50). Severity of NeP was positively associated with certain fear-associated behaviour and with decreased owner-perceived QoL. Thus, neurobehavioural changes should be considered in the management of NeP in CKCS with CM/SM. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To report the clinical findings associated with pulsus alternans in English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and to review the phenomenon of mechanical alternans, usually found in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
METHODS: The case records of 10 English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and pulsus alternans were reviewed. All dogs had been referred in moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Pulsus alternans was clinically recognised by palpation of a regular alternation of femoral pulse amplitude and confirmed by echocardiography in all cases. Pulsus alternans was an intermittent finding in all 10 dogs.
RESULTS: Phonocardiographic recordings were obtained in three dogs to document variation in the intensity of the heart sounds, with one case exhibiting absence of the second heart sound in alternate beats. M-mode echocardiography performed in all dogs showed alternation of the pattern of mitral valve diastolic motion. Doppler echocardiography showed marked alternation in stroke volume in the aortic outflow in all cases. It also showed alternation in mitral regurgitation and in the velocity of early ventricular filling.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pulsus alternans may be more prevalent in English cocker spaniels than in other breeds, and because of its intermittent nature, its incidence may be higher than that previously reported. It has diagnostic relevance as it usually indicates severe myocardial depression. Echocardiography allows non-invasive detection of mechanical alternans and provides further insights into its pathophysiology and clinical significance.},

The hypothesis of this study was that asymptomatic xanthinuria is common in Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs.
Methods Free catch urine samples were collected from 35 client-owned Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs and from 24 dogs of other breeds. The purine metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The urine ratios of xanthine/creatinine and hypoxanthine/creatinine were calculated and compared between the two groups of dogs.
Results The urine concentrations of purine metabolites were not significantly different between the two groups and were very low in both. The urine concentrations of xanthine in all 35 Cavalier King Charles spaniel were markedly lower than in the previously reported case of xanthine urolithiasis in a UK Cavalier King Charles spaniel dog.
Clinical Significance Asymptomatic xanthinuria was not detected in this UK Cavalier King Charles spaniel population. This data may be used as a reference for urinary purine metabolite concentrations in the dog.},

	abstract = {Background Syringomyelia (SM) is a debilitating condition in the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) that results in neuropathic pain and diminished quality of life. Von Frey aesthesiometry (VFA) is a method of mechanical quantitative sensory testing that provides an objective sensory threshold (ST) value and can be used to quantify neuropathic pain (NP) and monitor response to therapy. The utility of VFA has been previously established in client-owned dogs with acute spinal cord injury but the technique has not been evaluated in dogs with SM. The goal of this study was to evaluate ST, as determined by VFA, in dogs with and without SM, to assess the utility of VFA in quantifying NP in SM-affected dogs. We hypothesized the SM-affected CKCS would have lower ST values, consistent with hyperesthesia, when compared to control CKCS. Additionally, we hypothesized that ST values in SM-affected dogs would be inversely correlated with syrinx size on MRI and with owner-derived clinical sign scores. Results ST values for the thoracic and pelvic limbs differed significantly between the SM-affected and control CKCS (p = 0.027; p = 0.0396 respectively). Median ST value (range) for the thoracic limbs was 184.1 g (120.9-552) for control dogs, and 139.9 g (52.6-250.9) for SM-affected dogs. The median ST value (range) for the pelvic limbs was 164.9 g (100.8-260.3) in control dogs and 129.8 g (57.95-168.4) in SM-affected dogs. The ST values in SM-affected dogs did not correlate with syrinx height on MRI (r = 0.314; p = 0.137). Owner-reported clinical sign scores showed an inverse correlation with pelvic limb ST values, where dogs with lower ST values (hyperesthesia) were reported by their owners to display more frequent and severe clinical signs (r = - 0.657; p = 0.022). Conclusion ST values were lower in SM-affected CKCS compared to control dogs, suggesting the presence of neuropathic pain. Dogs with lower ST pelvic limb values were perceived by their owners to have more severe clinical signs classically associated with SM. Our results suggest that VFA might offer quantitative assessment of neuropathic pain in SM-affected dogs and could be useful for monitoring response to therapy in future clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary In our research, we discussed the problem of Chiari-like malformation-syringomyelia syndrome (CM-SM syndrome). It is challenging to determine the harmfulness of the disease as the severity of clinical symptoms is often not commensurate with MRI results. For the same reason, another challenge is a preventive prediction of the disease. In this study, we used the modern technique magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) to assess the microstructural degree of spinal cord damage in the course of syringomyelia. We found a difference in two DTI parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between non-symptomatic and symptomatic Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs. The use of DTI imaging in the MRI evaluation of CM-SM patients carries potential value in the development of a clinically useful protocol for an objective assessment of the spinal cord and to understand what processes lie at the basis of many diseases, the diagnosis of which is currently difficult. Tests performed on animals may contribute to progress in the diagnosis of CM-SM in humans. Syringomyelia secondary to Chiari-like malformation (so-called CM-SM syndrome) is a common disorder in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) that is diagnosed using standard structural MRI, though imaging findings often do not correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a technique that defines subtle microstructural changes in the course of many brain and spinal cord diseases, that are not visible on standard MRI. The aim of the study was to identify the correlation between the presence of clinical symptoms and DTI parameters, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the spinal cord in the course of CM-SM. Study subjects included 18 dogs, CKCS with MRI-confirmed SM (SM group), and 12 CKCS dogs without SM (non-SM group). The SM group was divided into SM-symptomatic group (n = 8) and SM-asymptomatic group, n = 10). All dogs underwent same clinical and neurological assessment followed by MRI examination. All MRI studies were performed on a 1.5T MRI scanner. The MRI spine protocol included: transverse and sagittal T2-weighted images followed by DTI performed in the sagittal plane. The measurements of FA and ADC values were performed manually using the region of interest (ROI) method at the level of three intervertebral discs between C1 and C4. Notable differences in age and body weight were found. No significant differences in FA and ADC values between the SM and non-SM groups were found, but between non-SM, SM-asymptomatic and SM-symptomatic groups significant differences were found in ADC values in all three ROIs and in FA values in ROI-1 and ROI-3. SM-symptomatic dogs compared to non-SM, showed decreased FA value in ROI-1 and ROI-3 also increased ADC value in ROI-1, ROI-2 and ROI-3. SM-symptomatic dogs compared to SM-asymptomatic showed also decreased FA value in ROI-1 and ROI-3, and also increased ADC value in ROI-1, ROI-2 and ROI-3. The results suggest that the values of DTI parameters correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms in the course of CM-SM in animals. The use of DTI evaluation of CM-SM patients carries a potential value as a clinically relevant protocol for an objective assessment of the spinal cord.},

Clinical data, imaging studies, presence of seizures and their management, as well as other comorbidities were noted. Animals Thirty-nine CKCS that were presented to 2 institutions between 2001 and 2018 with signs consistent with myoclonus. Clinical examination, blood sampling, advanced diagnostic imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and record keeping of other comorbidities was performed. Methods This is a retrospective case series, describing the presence of myoclonus in CKCS. Results Clinical signs reported were spontaneous in onset, lasted a few seconds and consisted of rapid blinking with head nodding and variable extension down the thoracic limbs. Myoclonus occasionally led to stumbling of the thoracic limbs or collapse. Mean age of onset was 8.38 years (SD +/- 1.96). Thirteen of 39 dogs with myoclonus had paroxysmal events, such as generalized seizures (9/13). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Myoclonus occurs in middle-aged to older CKCS and seems to be another epiphenomena of this breed. A link to epilepsy might be present.},

We prospectively performed clinical examinations and aural CT scanning for 38 American Cocker Spaniels. Computed tomographic transverse area of the osseous horizontal ear canal (TA1), transverse area of the widest air-filled part of the cartilaginous horizontal ear canal (TA2), tympanic bulla volume, and tympanic bulla wall thickness were measured. The TA1 and TA2 measurements were compared with those of 23 retrospectively recruited, similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs that had undergone CT-scanning of the head for non-ear-related reasons. The TA1 and TA2 did not differ for healthy American Cocker Spaniels and mesaticephalic dogs. Severely affected American Cocker Spaniels had significantly smaller TA2 (P {\textless} .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient for intraobserver and interobserver repeatability was 0.972 and 0.983 for TA1 and 0.994 and 0.998 for TA2, respectively. Variation between individuals was subjectively noted in healthy and affected American Cocker Spaniels, but mean tympanic bulla volume was slightly smaller in relation to body weight, and the tympanic bulla wall was thicker than in previous reports for mesaticephalic dogs. The tympanic bulla wall appeared thicker rostro-ventrally than caudo-ventrally in 44\% of the dogs.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging studies were retrieved for client-owned dogs less than 18 months of age. Breed, age, skull conformation, and the open or closed state of cranial base synchondroses were independently recorded by two observers. For dogs with a unanimous observer agreement, regression analysis was used to test effects of age and gender on the open or closed status of synchondroses and differences between groups. A total of 174 dogs were included in MRI interpretations and 165 dogs were included in the regression analysis.

One affected dog had no change in IgG concentration more than 3 months after resolution of infection or vaccination, but did have reduction in IgM concentration after resolution of infection and vaccination. Control dogs had low serum IgG and IgM concentrations, compared with the reference interval for all dogs. Lymphocyte count in blood was normal or high in 7 of 8 affected dogs. The results of this study suggest that there is a defect in immunity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels that underlies the susceptibility of these dogs to pneumocystosis. Further studies are indicated to elucidate the mechanisms behind the defect, the prevalence within the breed, and the potential mode of inheritance of the problem.},

Exploratory midline coeliotomy confirmed congenital pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic hernia with herniation and dilatation of the stomach. The hernia configuration was consistent in all cases, with a defect affecting the left diaphragmatic crus. Congenital pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic hernia is a rare condition caused by a defect in the dorsolateral diaphragm. Defects of the left crus of the diaphragm could result in the herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity with possible subsequent tension gastrothorax. Cavalier King Charles spaniels may have a predisposition to this condition. Tension gastrothorax is an acute life-threatening consequence of gastric herniation through a diaphragmatic defect that must be promptly recognised and surgically treated.},

MethodsForty-two healthy adult English springer spaniels were prospectively recruited from a general practice population in the UK. Animals were examined twice, at least 12 months apart, to exclude dogs with progressive cardiac disease. Reference intervals were calculated using Box-Cox transformations and specific variables were depicted within an expert consensus range. Relationships of body mass, age and heart rate with cardiac structure and function were examined and functional assessments were compared with previous reports. Reference intervals were compared against published ratiometric indices and allometric scaling models.
ResultsThirty-nine dogs contributed to create the reference intervals. Significant relationships with bodyweight, age and heart rate were detected, although low coefficients of determination were found. Fractional shortening values were lower than has been reported in many breeds but Simpson-derived ejection fractions were similar to previously published breed-specific values.
Clinical SignificanceBreed-specific reference intervals are reported allowing for more appropriate interpretation of echocardiographic assessments in the English springer spaniel.},

	abstract = {Objective. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, functional, and morphologic characteristics of platelets in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs (Cavaliers).
Materials and Methods. Blood from 69 clinically normal Cavaliers was collected and anticoagulated with ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citrate. Automated and manual platelet counts were obtained. Percent platelet aggregation in response to ADP (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 muM) was determined. Electron microscopy was performed to examine platelet internal morphology and dense granule distribution. A cardiologist recorded the quality of murmurs.
Results. Thrombocytopenia ({\textless}100,000/muL) was present in 51.43\% (36/69) of Cavaliers. Macrothrombocytes ({\textgreater}3 mum) were present in 33.33\% (22/69). Mean manual platelet count was 118,770/muL. Manual (EDTA blood) and automated (EDTA and citrated blood) methods of platelet counting were correlated. Prevalence of cardiac murmurs was 38\% (26/69). There was no association between affected dogs and murmur, signalment, or coat color. Mean percent platelet aggregation was significantly higher in controls than in Cavaliers (79\% vs 38\%, p = 0.001). Response to ADP was unaffected by thrombocytopenia, macrothrombocytes, murmur, or any combination thereof. Platelet electron microscopy showed normal and giant sized platelets with normal internal morphology.
Conclusions. A benign inherited giant platelet disorder affects approximately 50\% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, macrothrombocytes, or decreased platelet aggregation in response to ADP. Platelet ultrastructure is normal. Citrated or EDTA blood provides accurate platelet counts. Further studies are indicated to determine platelet glycoprotein structure and any association with mitral endocardiosis. Cavaliers may be useful models of inherited giant platelet disorders. (C) 2004 International Society for Experimental Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

This technique is used with great success in human medicine.
Study Design-Four CKCS diagnosed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of SHM because of cerebellar tonsil herniation and not responsive to medical therapy underwent a suboccipital craniectomy and dorsal laminectomy of C1 (2 dogs) and of C1 and partial C2 (2 dogs) with durotomy and placement of a dural graft. Three dogs were evaluated neurologically 24 hours, I month, and 3 months postoperatively and evaluations were compared with preoperative neurological examination. Repeat MRI took place 3 months postoperatively.
Results-Neurological examinations showed neither improvement nor progression of clinical signs 3 months postoperatively. MRI showed no regression of syrinx size 3 months postoperatively.
Conclusion-Improvement was not seen. Given the progressive nature of the disorder, evaluation over a longer period of time is necessary to detect if progression has stopped. Some modification to the surgical technique is needed to accomplish the same results as in human medicine. A study of a larger population is needed to attain more reliable information.
Clinical Relevance-Suboccipital craniectomy and dorsal laminectomy of C1 with durotomy and placement of a dural graft is a feasible technique in CKCS, but needs some modification to accomplish the same results as in human medicine.

	abstract = {Syringomyelia is a common and chronic neurological disorder affecting Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. The condition is putatively painful, but evaluating the affective component of chronic pain in non-human animals is challenging. Here we employed two methods designed to assess animal affect - the judgement bias and reward loss sensitivity tests - to investigate whether Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with syringomyelia (exhibiting a fluid filled cavity (syrinx) in the spinal cord of {\textgreater}= 2 mm diameter) were in a more negative affective state than those without the condition. Dogs with syringomyelia did not differ in age from those without the condition, but owners reported that they scratched more (P {\textless} 0.05), in line with previous findings. They also showed a more negative judgement of ambiguous locations in the judgement bias task (P {\textless} 0.05), indicating a more negative affective state, but did not show a greater sensitivity to loss of food rewards. These measures were unaffected by whether the dog was or was not receiving painaelleving medication. Across all subjects, dogs whose owners reported high levels of scratching showed a positive judgement bias (P {\textless} 0.05), indicating that scratching was not directly associated with a negative affective state. Tests of spontaneous behaviour (latency to jump up to or down from a 30 cm high platform) and physiology (thermography of the eye) did not detect any differences. These results provide initial evidence from the judgement bias task that syringomyelia may be associated with negative affect in dogs, and open the way for further and larger studies to confirm findings and investigate the effects of medication in more detail.},

METHODSIn a prospective study, gonioscopy was performed in both eyes of 227 Welsh springer spaniels and intraocular pressure measured by rebound tonometry. Eyes were classified as "unaffected" if 0\% of the iridocorneal angle was affected with pectinate ligament dysplasia (grade 0), mildly affected if {\textless} 20\% was affected (grade 1), moderately affected if 20 to 90\% was affected (grade 2) and severely affected if {\textgreater} 90\% was affected (grade 3). In a retrospective study, progression of pectinate ligament dysplasia over time was investigated for 65 dogs.
RESULTSOne hundred and thirty-nine of 227 dogs (61 center dot 2\%) were affected by pectinate ligament dysplasia (grades 1 to 3) and 82/227 (36 center dot 2\%) were moderately or severely affected. There was a significant association between pectinate ligament dysplasia and age. There were no associations between pectinate ligament dysplasia and intraocular pressure or pectinate ligament dysplasia and sex. Thirty-five of 65 dogs (53 center dot 8\%) demonstrated progression of pectinate ligament dysplasia.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCEPrevalence of pectinate ligament dysplasia was high despite widespread screening and selection against the condition. Our data indicate that gonioscopic features of pectinate ligament dysplasia can progress in the Welsh springer spaniel. Dogs deemed unaffected at an early age may subsequently be diagnosed with pectinate ligament dysplasia.},

METHODS: Clinically normal adult cavalier King Charles spaniel underwent ultrasonographic examination of the spinal cord and caudal fossa. Computed tomography was used to measure the caudal fossa and magnetic resonance imaging allowed syringomyelia and cerebellar herniation identification.
RESULTS: Of the 16 dogs in the study, seven had syringomyelia (43.7 per cent). All dogs had cerebellar herniation, suggesting Chiari-like malformation and also a tendency to occipital dysplasia. Computed tomography measurements of the caudal fossa are reported. In one dog, a syrinx was identified by ultrasonography. The only difference between dogs with or without syringomyelia was that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia were statistically older.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The incidence of Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia may be high in an asymptomatic population of cavalier King Charles spaniel. Computed tomography measurements reported in this study should now be compared with those of a symptomatic population to evaluate the hypothesis that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia syndrome have a smaller caudal fossa. This study did not identify a smaller caudal fossa in an asymptomatic cavalier King Charles spaniel population with syringomyelia. Ultrasonography probably has a low sensitivity for diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia.},

	abstract = {A total of 51 seven-week-old English Cocker Spaniel puppies were measured for dominant-aggressive behaviour using the Campbell Test. The dogs consisted of a F-1 full sibs and half sibs from matings of 4 sires with 10 dams. The purpose of this study was to determine if the variability observed in this behavioural characteristic has an additive genetic component and if so, to estimate heritability (h(2)). Coat colour and sex were examined as fixed effects.
According to the results of the study: (1) there are highly significant differences between sexes; with males being more dominant than females, regardless of coat colour; (2) there are highly significant differences in aggressive behaviour depending on coat colour with greater to lesser dominance found in golden, black and particolour coats in that order; (3) there is no interaction between sex and colour when exhibiting greater or lesser dominance; (4) heritability, estimated on sire components, is h(s)(2) = 0.20, indicating that the variability observed in dominant-aggressive behaviour is in part due to genetic factors; and (5) heritability estimated on dam components is h(D)(2) = 0.46, which implies that the maternal effect (genetic and environmental) is an important factor in this type of behaviour.
It is concluded that there is an additive genetic, and therefore, hereditary factor for dominant-aggressive behaviour in the English Cocker Spaniel. Some of the fixed factors include: sex (males are dominant over females), coat colour (golden-coated are the more dominant dogs followed by the black-coated and finally by the particolour coat dogs) and the common environmental effect due to litter.

Design-Original study.
Animals-45 dogs with IE and 74 siblings and their respective parents.
Procedure-IE was diagnosed on the basis of age at the time of seizure onset and results of laboratory testing and neurologic examinations. Simple segregation analysis was performed with the Davie method.
Results-Median age at the onset of seizures was 3 years; however, 9 (20\%) dogs were between 5 and 6 years old at the time of the onset of seizures. Twenty-one dogs (47\%) had generalized seizures, and 24 (53\%) had focal onset seizures. Results of segregation analysis were consistent with partially penetrant autosomal recessive or polygenic inheritance. Simulated linkage indicated that there was a 58\% chance of obtaining suggestive linkage with the available pedigrees.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results of the present study suggest that in English Springer Spaniels, IE segregates in a manner that is consistent with partially penetrant autosomal recessive inheritance (ie, a single major locus with modifying genes) or polygenic inheritance. Given enough families with accurate phenotypic information and available DNA, it should be possible to use genetic linkage analysis to identify chromosomal segments containing the causative gene or genes.},

Methods: Nineteen cases (13 litters) were investigated, with particular reference to eye and skin clinical signs. In addition, five generation pedigrees were obtained and studied from all cases with the exception of one.
Results: The eye signs were due to keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a common ocular disease in the dog, but rarely of congenital origin. The skin signs were of an ichthyosiform dermatosis; ichthyosis being a rare skin disease in the dog. In human beings, ichthyosis is a similar disease, mainly inherited and with a neonatal onset, and sometimes accompanied by other developmental defects. In the cavalier King Charles spaniel, the coat abnormality was noted at birth by the breeders as a 'curly coat', with deterioration of the skin signs as the animal became adult.
Clinical Significance: These two conditions occurring together in this breed is well recognised by some breeders but rarely by the veterinary profession. Successful treatment is not possible, although some improvement, particularly of the keratoconjunctivitis sicca, can be obtained. The probable hereditary nature of the condition is an important factor for control.},

	abstract = {Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a common disease in the English cocker spaniel (ECS) and is characterized histologically by duct destruction, interlobular fibrosis and dense periductular and perivenous lymphocytic aggregates. These features are also found in human autoimmune pancreatitis type 1, part of a glucocorticoid-responsive, multiorgan syndrome, newly recognized as IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Human IgG4-RD affects one or several organs, often showing a predominance of IgG4(+) plasma cells histologically, with an IgG4(+) :total IgG(+) plasma cell ratio of {\textgreater}40\%. This study investigated whether ECSs with CP and/or inflammatory disease in several organs show an increase in IgG4(+) plasma cells within affected tissues. Histological sections of pancreas, liver, kidney, salivary gland and conjunctiva were obtained from ECSs with idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease affecting those tissues. Tissue samples from age-matched dogs of other breeds with similar diseases were also sampled. Control diseased tissue samples, from dogs without a suspected immune-mediated disease, were included. A subset of ECSs and dogs of other breeds presented with disease in more than one organ. Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary reagents detecting total IgG and three of the four canine IgG subclasses (IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). Normal sections of pancreas and liver showed an absence of labelled plasma cells of any subclass. Normal kidney and salivary gland sections showed the presence of a few labelled plasma cells ({\textless}10 plasma cells/high-power field). Fourteen tissue sections from 12 ECSs and seven sections from six dogs of other breeds showed elevated numbers of IgG4(+) plasma cells and IgG4(+):IgG(+) ratios {\textgreater}40\%. Individual dogs (ECSs and other breeds) showed marked increases in IgG4(+) cells. There were no significant differences in the number of IgG4(+) plasma cells between ECSs and dogs of other breeds for affected pancreas, liver, salivary glands and conjunctiva. Kidney sections had more IgG4(+) cells, for both ECSs and dogs of other breeds, than did sections from other organs. Dogs of other breeds had significantly more IgG4(+) plasma cells in affected kidneys than ECSs. In conclusion, several ECSs and dogs of other breeds fulfilled the histological criteria for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, supporting the existence of a multiorgan immune-mediated disease in ECSs and some dogs of other breeds.

	abstract = {Background: Mammary gland tumors are the most common tumors in sexually intact female dogs; however, they are rare in male dogs. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between sexual hormones and mammary gland tumors in a male dog.
Case presentation: A 13-year-old, intact male Cocker Spaniel presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Kangwon National University, Republic of Korea, with an acute right ruptured caudal abdominal mass. Physical examination revealed a 14 x 14 cm ruptured mass in the right caudal abdomen, as well as a 1.5 x 1.5 cm mass in the first right mammary gland. The estrogen and progesterone concentrations in serum were within normal levels. Total mastectomy was done on the right side mammary glands. Following surgery, the site was fully recovered; however, a mass that had grown to 2 x 2 cm was found in the left fifth mammary gland and a testis tumor was also found over the period of 4 months. Mastectomy was performed on the left caudal mammary gland and castration was also performed. After the final surgery, the dog fully recovered. Histopathological examination of all three masses revealed high grade mammary adenocarcinoma in the mammary gland and the testis was diagnosed as Leydig cell adenoma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the estrogen and progesterone receptors were expressed on limited cells in mammary and testis tumors.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that mammary tumors and testes tumors can occur in male dogs without relationship to female sexual hormone.},

Vertebral heart size (VHS), vertebral left atrial size (VLAS), modified VLAS (M-VLAS), and radiographic left atrial dimension (RLAD) are reported as objective measurements of global heart size and left atrial size. Normal VHS in CKCS (10.6 +/- 0.5) is reportedly higher than the nonbreed-specific value (9.7 +/- 0.5). Breed-specific VLAS, M-VLAS, and RLAD cut-offs have not been reported in CKCS. The aim of this prospective reference interval study was to describe the VHS, VLAS, M-VLAS, and RLAD values for 30 clinically healthy adult CKCS. Inclusion criteria were unremarkable physical examination, normal echocardio-graphy, and thoracic radiographs without malposition/abnormalities. There were 22 female and eight male dogs. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years. The VHS mean value in our sample was 10.08 +/- 0.56 (95\% range, 9.87-10.29). This was significantly greater than a previously published general canine reference value of 9.7 +/- 0.5 and significantly less than a previously published CKCS breed-specific value of 10.6 +/- 0.5 (P {\textless} 0.01).

	abstract = {Objective: A 5.5-year-old male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) was presented with an intermittent gait abnormality of one front limb. During these episodes the dog flexed one front limb for some minutes like a kind of "greeting". Between these episodes the dog's gait was normal. Material and methods: On the basis of the neurological examination the neuroanatomical localisation was considered to be primarily in the upper motor neuron of the cervical spine. As a diagnostic imaging tool, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, cervical and thoracic spinal cord was performed and the area of the foramen magnum was shown by computed tomography. Results: In this patient a moderate herniation of the cerebellum and severe syringohydromyelia of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord (Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia; CM/SM) was diagnosed. The foramen magnum was dorsally widened in a keyhole shape. As therapy of the syringohydromyelia a dorsal laminectomy at the level of the first cervical vertebra with fenestration of the dura mater was performed. Up to a post surgery follow-up eight weeks later, the dog no longer showed"greeting", although in a repeated MRI the dimensions of the syrinx still remained. Conclusion: Many neurologic signs are described in association with a syrinx. This is the first case report of a CKCS presenting intermittent "greeting". Furthermore the dog showed a combination of two anomalies: Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia (CM/SM) and occipital dysplasia. Clinical relevance: It is recommended that the CKCS should be screened for breeding purposes not only for occipital hypoplasia but also for occipital dysplasia. A surgical decompression of the cerebrospinal fluid-filled space can result in resolution of clinical signs, whereas MRI failed to demonstrate an improvement of the syrinx. Further studies with advanced MRI techniques would be necessary in the future to diagnose morphologic as well as functional options of the cerebrospinal fluid-filled space and -flow.},

Animals: Sixty-three ESS (2 with ARHN, 2 obligate carriers, and 59 others), 2 mixed-breed dogs with X-linked HN, and 2 English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) with ARHN were included.
Methods: ARHN was diagnosed based on transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. DNA from affected dogs was screened for the mutation known to cause ARHN in ECS. Quantities of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA transcripts in renal cortex were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ARHN-affected dogs and 7 other dogs. The coding regions of COL4A3 and COL4A4 were sequenced for the 2 ARHN-affected ESS and an unaffected dog. Exon 30 of COL4A4 was sequenced for all 63 ESS.
Results: qRT-PCR indicated a significant reduction in transcript levels of both COL4A3 and COL4A4 mRNA in the kidney of ARHN-affected ESS. Sequencing identified a single nucleotide substitution in COL4A4 at base 2806 resulting in a premature stop codon. Thirteen of 25 related dogs were identified as carriers.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: A mutation highly likely to cause ARHN in ESS has been identified.},

Proteinuria persisted while each puppy's growth rate slowed, and renal function gradually deteriorated. The interval from onset of proteinuria to development of azotemia was two-to-nine months. Characteristic glomerular capillary basement membrane (GCBM) lesions were seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of renal biopsy specimens obtained during this interval. Ultrastructural GCBM lesions progressed substantially during the interval from biopsy to necropsy. However, routine light microscopic findings did not allow definitive diagnosis of FN in either biopsy or necropsy specimens.
Detection of FN can be accomplished by screening at-risk ECSs for proteinuria. Renal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis in dogs for which proteinuria cannot be explained otherwise.

We also aimed to determine if significant differences existed when counting platelets manually, by auto analyser or by blood smear estimation in CKCS and mixed breed dogs.
Methods Blood was collected from 172 dogs (152 CKCS and 20 mixed breed) and placed into sodium-citrate anticoagulant. Platelet counts were performed manually, by auto analyser and by blood smear estimates in CKCS and mixed breed dogs. Blood smears were also examined for platelet clumping and erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet morphology. Pedigree analysis was performed to determine if an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern was supported.
Results A statistically significant difference was found in platelet counts between CKCS and mixed breed dogs (P {\textless} 0.0001). CKCS had a platelet count that was 32\% that of the controls (95\% confidence interval, 28 to 37\%). There was no significant difference between methods used to count platelets. Thirty percent of CKCS had macrothrombocytes. Pedigree analysis and examination of obtained and expected segregation ratios from 17 CKCS families supported an autosomal recessive pattern of Mendelian inheritance.
Conclusions A high prevalence of idiopathic macrothrombocytopenia exists in CKCS in NSW and automated or blood smear estimates are sufficient to count platelet numbers. Data supports an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.},

	abstract = {Our aim was to determine the relative volume of the occipital bone of Cavalier King Charles spaniels with and without syringohydromyelia and normal French bulldogs to reappraise the role of a possible insufficiency of the paraxial mesoderm in the pathogenesis of the caudal occipital malformation syndrome. Analysis of the occipital bone volume of 43 dogs based on computed tomography datasets was performed. Volume was determined by means of three-dimensional models. Using manual segmentation of the occipital bone in sagittal, transverse, and dorsal images, the volume of the occipital bone and the rest of the skull was calculated. The absolute occipital bone volume was put in relation to the total skull volume, the occipital bone index. For the Cavalier King Charles spaniels without syringomyelia, the median occipital bone index was 0.0681; for Cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia, it was 0.0646 and for French bulldogs, it was 0.0676. There was no global difference of the occipital bone index between examined groups (P = 0.4331). A reduced volume of the occipital bone was not found in Cavalier King Charles spaniels in general in comparison to French bulldogs, or in Cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia compared to Cavalier King Charles spaniels without syringomyelia. These results do not support occipital hypoplasia as a cause for syringomyelia development, challenging the paraxial mesoderm insufficiency theory. This also suggests that the term Chiari-like malformation, a term derived from human studies, is not appropriate in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to report the findings of clinical and genetic evaluation of a 3-month old male Boykin spaniel (the proband) that presented with progressive weakness. The puppy underwent a physical and neurological examination, serum biochemistry and complete blood cell count, electrophysiological testing, muscle biopsy and whole genome sequencing. Clinical evaluation revealed generalized neuromuscular weakness with tetraparesis and difficulty holding the head up and a dropped jaw. There was diffuse spontaneous activity on electromyography, most severe in the cervical musculature. Nerve conduction studies were normal, the findings were interpreted as consistent with a myopathy. Skeletal muscle was grossly abnormal on biopsy and there were necklace fibers and abnormal triad structure localization on histopathology, consistent with myotubular myopathy. Whole genome sequencing revealed a premature stop codon in exon 13 of MTM1 (ChrX: 118,903,496 C {\textgreater} T, c.1467C {\textgreater} T, p.Arg512X). The puppy was humanely euthanized at 5 months of age. The puppy's dam was heterozygous for the variant, and 3 male puppies from a subsequent litter all of which died by 2 weeks of age were hemizygous for the variant. This naturally occurring mutation in Boykin spaniels causes a severe form of X-linked myotubular myopathy, comparable to the human counterpart. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow secondary to Chiari malformations is thought to cause syringomyelia in humans, this relationship is unknown in dogs. We used phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to evaluate CSF flow in dogs. Fifty-nine Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were assigned a neurologic grade reflecting their neurologic status. Five normal control dogs of other breeding were imaged for comparison. The presence of syringomyelia was noted from sagittal MR images. The pattern and velocity of CSF flow were assessed using phase-contrast cine MRI at the foramen magnum, C2-C3 disc space, and within syrinxes. Flow was measured most easily with the neck flexed to mimic standing. CSF flow velocity in the dorsal aspect of the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum was significantly higher in control dogs than Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (P=0.035). Flow was obstructed at the foramen magnum in 41 of 59 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Turbulent flow and jets were associated with syringomyelia presence and severity, and CSF flow velocity at C2/3 dorsally was inversely related to the presence of syringomyelia (P=0.0197). Peak dorsal subarachnoid space CSF flow velocity at the foramen magnum and C2-C3 were together highly predictive of syringomyelia. CSF flow can be assessed in dogs using phase-contrast cine MRI. Obstruction to flow at the foramen magnum is common in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and CSF flow pattern and velocity are related to the presence of syringomyelia.},

Thus, the identification of dogs with a morphotype associated with more severe mitral disease at a young age is desirable. The aims of this study were to: (1) describe the physical, morphometric, and echocardiographic features of class B1 MMVD-affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines; (2) evaluate the influence of morphometric physical measurements on murmur intensity, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), regurgitant jet size, and indexed mitral valve and annulus measurements. Fifty-two MMVD-affected CKCS were included in the ACVIM class B1. This is a prospective clinical cross-sectional study. Morphometric measurements, which included the body, thorax, and head sizes of each dog, were investigated to establish the association with heart murmur intensity, valvular and annular echocardiographic measurements, MVP, and regurgitant jet size, using inverse probability weighting (IPW) analyses to adjust for confounding. The IPW analyses showed that when the head length and nose length decreased, dogs had a more severe regurgitant jet size. Furthermore, subjects with a more pronounced head stop angle had thicker anterior mitral valve leaflets. A brachycephalic morphotype, as seen in dogs similar to the King Charles Spaniel breed in terms of cephalic morphology, is associated with a more severe regurgitant jet size and with valvular characteristics that are related to the most severe forms of MMVD.},

An index for LA size (LA/AO) was calculated in 166 cavalier King Charles spaniels, 56 normal and 110 dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) of varying degrees secondary to chronic valvular disease. In normal dogs, the AO-2-D and LA/AO-2-D did not correlate to body weight (BW) or BW2; whereas, all M-mode values and the LA-2-D were significantly (p {\textless} .05) related to both BW parameters. In normal dogs, there was no difference between M-mode and 2-D indices. For all dogs (normal and dogs with MR) there was an 11\% bias between the M-mode and 2-D index with the LA/AO-2-D being higher than the LA/AO-M. The association between the mean and the difference of the indices demonstrated a quadratic relationship. Dogs with a mean LA/AO of 2.0-2.5 showed the largest difference between the two indices. Small values for the 2-D coefficients of variation for respiration and stage of diastole were found; 3.4 and 3.1\%, respectively.

	abstract = {Objectives:
To investigate the possible association between caudal fossa area and cervical vertebral dimensions and the presence of syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels.
Methods:
From magnetic resonance imaging scans of 78 cavalier King Charles spaniels, measurements were made of the widest vertical spinal width at C1/C2, C2, C2/C3 and C3; angulation of the C2/C3 spine; and estimated caudal fossa area. A correlation between these measurements and syringomyelia was sought.
Results:
A total of 59 dogs with and 19 without syringomyelia were compared. Older dogs had a significantly higher incidence of syringo-myelia. No difference in incidence was noted between genders. There was no significant difference in vertebral canal width at C1/C2 and C2, or angulation of C2/C3 between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups. The width of the canal at C2/C3 and C3 was significantly increased in syringomyelia dogs. There was no significant difference in the caudal fossa area between groups.
Clinical Significance:
Although syringomyelia was shown to be more prevalent in older dogs, the age beyond which dogs were considered at greater risk was not deducible from the dataset. The association identified between wider spinal canal at C3, and C2/C3 and syringomyelia presence is of questionable clinical significance, as the difference between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups is too small to be measured in a clinical setting.},

The histopathologic lesions in English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) with CP were noted to be histologically different than those of other breeds with CP.
Hypothesis: CP in ECS is distinct from CP in other breeds and is characterized by a duct destruction similar to what is observed in autoimmune CP of humans.
Animals: Eight ECS and 9 other breeds with histologically confirmed CP recruited over an 8-year period and 50 postmortem control dogs with CP.
Methods: Clinical, clinicopathological, and ultrasonographic findings were recorded. Histological sections were compared with a normal dog and 59 dogs of other breeds with CP. Immunohistochemistry using anti-CD3, anti-CD79a, and anti-cytokeratin antibodies was used to evaluate distribution and type of lymphocytic inflammation and appearance of pancreatic ducts.
Results: Four male and 4 female ECS presented at a mean age of 7.2 years. Clinical signs were similar in ECS and other breeds. The pancreas was enlarged and hypoechoic in 4 ECS and 2 controls. Histopathology was characterized by interlobular and periductular fibrosis and inflammation in ECS compared with intralobular disease in most other breeds. Immunohistochemistry identified prominent anti-CD3(+) lymphocytic infiltrates around venules and ducts and a marked absence of interlobular ducts in ECS compared with mixed T-cell infiltration and ductular hyperplasia in most other breeds with CP.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: CP in ECS is distinct from CP in other breeds and is notably duct destructive.},

	abstract = {It is assumed that Cavalier King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia experience central neuropathic pain. An association between spinal cord parenchymal lesions and specific clinical signs (e.g. spontaneous and evoked scratching, withdrawal, and paroxysmal pain manifestations with vocalisation) has been suggested. This led to the hypothesis that mechanical sensory threshold is altered in clinical cases. The aim of this study was to quantify the cervical mechanical sensory threshold using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments in nine Cavalier King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and assumed syringomyelia-associated central neuropathic pain compared to eight control dogs. Clinical and neurological examination including magnetic resonance imaging was undertaken.
Mean mechanical sensory threshold was not significantly different between case and control dogs (t-test on 1og10 transformed data; P = 0.25). Substantial variation within and between dogs was seen, with individual thresholds ranging from 0.04 to 26g in case dogs and from 0.02 to log in control dogs. Based on these results, it is unlikely that Cavalier King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia have increased mechanical sensation characterised by lower mechanical sensory threshold when quantified with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Whether clinical cases experience central neuropathic pain remains unknown. The assessment of sensory function in dogs with assumed central neuropathic pain should be multimodal and include not only mechanical but also tactile and thermal threshold quantification. The use of threshold quantification in a clinical setting is challenging due to an insufficient signal relative to the biological background noise within and between dogs. (C) 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Objective To analyze proteomic profiles of the aqueous humor (AH) of canines with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and identify associated protein alterations. Animals studied Six American Cocker Spaniels with PACG and six American Cocker Spaniels without ocular diseases. Methods Aqueous humor samples were collected from six American Cocker Spaniels with PACG at Seoul National University, VMTH, and six healthy Cocker Spaniels without ocular disease at Irion Animal Hospital. For the PACG group, AH samples were obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis prior to glaucoma treatment. For the AH control group, AH samples were collected from patients anesthetized for other reasons. Total AH protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. AH protein samples were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Raw MS spectra were processed using MaxQuant software 30, and the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using ClueGO. Results The AH protein concentration in the PACG group (10.49 +/- 17.98 mu g/mu l) was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.45 +/- 0.11 mu g/mu l; p {\textless} .05). A total of 758 proteins were identified in the AH. Several proteins both significantly increased (n = 69) and decreased (n = 252) in the PACG group compared to those in the control group. GO enrichment analysis showed that the "response to wounding," "negative regulation of endopeptidase activity," and "cell growth" pathways were the most enriched terms in the PACG group compared to the control group. The top 5 proteins that were significantly increased in the AH of the PACG group were secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), peptidoglycan recognition proteins 2 (PGLYRP2), tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (YWHAE), maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM), and vimentin (VIM). Conclusions Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the proteomic data showed that proteins and pathways related to inflammation were significantly upregulated in the various stage of PACG. Proteomic analysis of the AH from the PACG may provide valuable insights into PACG pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Introduction: To describe the signalment, physical examination, and echocardiographic findings of a series of English Springer Spaniels (ESSs) diagnosed with congenital mitral valve dysplasia (MD). Animals: Eight client-owned ESSs with congenital MD referred for murmur investigation and/or suspected congestive heart failure (CHF).
Materials and methods: Retrospective case series. Medical records and echocardiograms were reviewed to collect relevant data. Echocardiograms were assessed for the following abnormalities consistent with MD: thickened valve leaflets or leaflet tips, a 'hockey stick' appearance to the valve leaflets, abnormal length of one leaflet with respect to the other, and tethering of one or both leaflets to the papillary muscles.
Results: All eight dogs showed the typical echocardiographic lesions associated with MD: thickened leaflet tips (5/8), 'hockey stick' appearance (5/8), elongated anterior leaflet (4/8), tethering of one or both leaflets (7/8). Seven of the eight dogs presented in CHF. Six of the eight dogs had left ventricular dilation in both systole and diastole. Two of the eight dogs had reduced systolic function as assessed by ejection fraction/fractional shortening; however end-systolic volume index was increased in 6/8 dogs. Two dogs subsequently developed atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions: Congenital MD should be considered in ESSs with a left-sided apical systolic murmur, particularly in younger dogs. The valve changes seen are similar to those reported in other breeds with MD (thickened leaflet tips, hockey stick appearance to open leaflet tips, abnormal leaflet tethering, abnormally shaped leaflets) and may result in marked remodeling and CHF. 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Animals-70 CKCSs and 80 mesaticephalic (control) dogs.
Procedures-Dogs were placed into 4 groups as follows: Labrador Retrievers (n = 40), spaniel-type dogs (40; English Springer Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels), CKCSs with syringomyelia (55), and CKCSs without syringomyelia (15). Multiple morphometric measurements (linear, angular, and area) were obtained from cranial midsagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images including the brain and cervical portion of the spinal cord. Several specific MRI findings were also recorded for CKCSs that appeared to affect the occipital bone and cervicomedullary junction.
Results-No significant difference was identified among breeds in control groups and between sexes in any of the groups for all morphometric measurements. Significant differences were identified in CKCSs, compared with mesaticephalic dogs, in the area of the caudal cranial fossa and for several linear measurements that reflected the length of the ventral aspect of the occipital bone. These differences were greater in CKCSs with syringomyelia. All CKCSs had abnormalities in occipital bone shape.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-CKCSs had a shallower caudal cranial fossa and abnormalities of the occipital bone, compared with those of mesaticephalic dogs. These changes were more severe in CKCSs with syringomyelia. (Am J Vet Res 2009;70:340345)},

Ninety-four dogs with PG (cases) and 111 dogs without glaucoma (controls) met phenotypic criteria and had a blood sample collected after receiving informed owner consent.
PROCEDURES
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and genotyped (CanineHD BeadChip, Illumina Inc). A case-control GWAS using a linear mixed model was performed, and 3 significance thresholds were calculated (1) using a Bonferroni correction on all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the GWAS, (2) using a Bonferroni correction on only the unlinked SNPs from a pruned data set, and (3) using 10,000 random phenotype permutations.
RESULTS
Following genotype data quality control, 89 cases and 93 controls were included in the GWAS. We identified an association on canine chromosome (CFA10); however, it did not reach statistical significance. Potential candidate genes within the surrounding linkage disequilibrium interval include coiled-coil domain containing 85A (CCDC85A) and extracellular growth factor containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1).},

	abstract = {Inherited bleeding disorders including abnormalities of platelet number and function rarely occur in a variety of dog breeds, but are probably underdiagnosed. Genetically characterized canine forms of platelet disorders provide valuable large animal models for understanding similar platelet disorders in people. Breed-specific disease associated genetic variants in only eight different genes are known to cause intrinsic platelet disorders in dogs. However, the causative genetic variant in many dog breeds has until now remained unknown. Four cases of a mild to severe bleeding disorder in Cocker Spaniel dogs are herein presented. The affected dogs showed a platelet adhesion defect characterized by macrothrombocytopenia with variable platelet counts resembling human Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). Furthermore, the lack of functional GPIb-IX-V was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Whole genome sequencing of one affected dog and visual inspection of the candidate genes identified a deletion in the glycoprotein IX platelet (GP9) gene. The GP9 gene encodes a subunit of a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein complex; this functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor, which initiates the maintenance of hemostasis after injury. Variants in human GP9 are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, type C. The deletion spanned 2460 bp, and included a significant part of the single coding exon of the canine GP9 gene on dog chromosome 20. The variant results in a frameshift and premature stop codon which is predicted to truncate almost two-thirds of the encoded protein. PCR-based genotyping confirmed recessive inheritance. The homozygous variant genotype seen in affected dogs did not occur in 98 control Cocker Spaniels. Thus, it was concluded that the structural variant identified in the GP9 gene was most likely causative for the BSS-phenotype in the dogs examined. These findings provide the first large animal GP9 model for this group of inherited platelet disorders and greatly facilitate the diagnosis and identification of affected and/or normal carriers in Cocker Spaniels.},

Chiari-like malformation-associated pain (CM-P) can be challenging to diagnose. We propose a machine learning approach to characterize morphological changes in dogs that may or may not be apparent to human observers. This data-driven approach can remove potential bias (or blindness) that may be produced by a hypothesis-driven expert observer approach. Hypothesis/Objectives To understand neuromorphological change and to identify image-based biomarkers in dogs with CM-P and symptomatic SM (SM-S) using a novel machine learning approach, with the aim of increasing the understanding of these disorders. Animals Thirty-two client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs; 11 controls, 10 CM-P, 11 SM-S). Methods Retrospective study using T2-weighted midsagittal Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) anonymized images, which then were mapped to images of an average clinically normal CKCS reference using Demons image registration. Key deformation features were automatically selected from the resulting deformation maps. A kernelized support vector machine was used for classifying characteristic localized changes in morphology. Results Candidate biomarkers were identified with receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (sensitivity 82\%; specificity 69\%) for the CM-P biomarkers collectively and an AUC of 0.82 (sensitivity, 93\%; specificity, 67\%) for the SM-S biomarkers, collectively. Conclusions and clinical importance Machine learning techniques can assist CM/SM diagnosis and facilitate understanding of abnormal morphology location with the potential to be applied to a variety of breeds and conformational diseases.},

Materials and Methods In this retrospective UK-based multicentre study, 64 dogs were recruited from 10 referral centres, 32 first-opinion practices and three histopathology/cytology laboratories, between 2010 and 2016. Results The median age at presentation was 6 years (range: 0.17 to 11.75). Neutered females were frequently affected. Pyrexia (83.8\%), peripheral lymphadenomegaly (78.4\%), dermatological lesions (72.9\%), lethargy (67.6\%), hyporexia (54\%), diarrhoea (29.7\%), coughing (24.3\%), epistaxis, sneezing or nasal discharge (21.6\%), ocular signs (21.6\%) and vomiting (16.2\%) were reported in dogs for which the history and physical examination records were available. Popliteal (45.3\%), superficial cervical (35.9\%) and submandibular (37.5\%) lymphadenomegaly were frequently reported. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed non-specific changes. When undertaken, testing for infectious diseases was negative in all cases. Lymph node cytology, histopathology or both demonstrated mixed inflammatory (27\%), pyogranulomatous (24\%), neutrophilic (20\%) or granulomatous (11\%) lymphadenitis. Treatment details were available for 38 dogs, with 34 receiving prednisolone for a median duration of 15 weeks (range: 1 to 28 weeks). A good to excellent clinical response was reported in all but one case. Ten dogs relapsed after discontinuing prednisolone. Clinical Significance Idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy and pyrexia in English springer spaniels.

	abstract = {Fourteen American Cocker Spaniels (ACS) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were studied to determine if individuals of this breed with DCM are systemically taurine-or carnitine-deficient and to determine if they are responsive to taurine and carnitine supplementation. American Cocker Spaniels with DCM were identified using echocardiography, and plasma was analyzed for taurine and carnitine concentrations. Each dog was randomly assigned to receive either taurine and carnitine supplementation or placebos. Echocardiograms and clinical examinations were repeated monthly for 4 months. During this period, the investigators and owners were blinded with respect to the treatment being administered. Each dog was weaned off Its cardiovascular drugs (furosemide, digoxin, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) if an echocardiographic response was identified. At the 4-month time period, each investigator was asked to decide whether he or she thought his or her patient was receiving placebo or taurine/ carnitine, based on presence or absence of clinical and echocardiographic improvement. Unblinding then occurred, and dogs receiving placebos were switched to taurine and carnitine supplementation and followed monthly for 4 additional months. All dogs were reexamined 6 months after starting supplementation; survival time and cause of death were recorded for each dog. Data from 3 dogs were not included because of multiple protocol violations. Each dog had a plasma taurine concentration {\textless}50 nmol/ml. (mean +/-SD for the group 15 +/- 17 nmol/ mL) at baseline; normal range, 50-180 nmol/mL. The plasma taurine concentration did not exceed 50 nmol/mL at any time in the dogs receiving placebos (n = 5), but increased to 357 +/- 157 nmol/mL (range 140-621 nmol/mL) during taurine and carnitine supplementation (n = 11). Plasma carnitine concentration was within, only slightly below, or slightly above reported limits of normality at baseline (29 +/- 15 mu mol/L); did not change during placebo administration; and increased significantly during supplementation (349 +/- 119 mu mol/L; n = 11). Echocardiographic variables did not change during placebo administration. During supplementation, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and mitral valve E point-to-septal separation decreased significantly in both groups. Shortening fraction increased significantly but not into the normal range. Echocardiographic variables remained improved at 6 months. All dogs were successfully weaned off furosemide, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin once an echocardiographic response was identified. Nine of the dogs have died since the onset of the study in 1992. One dog died of recurrence of DCM and heart failure 31 months after starting supplementation; six dogs died of noncardiac causes. Two dogs developed degenerative mitral valve disease and died of complications of this disease. Dogs less than 10 years of age lived for 46 +/- 11 months, whereas dogs older than 10 years of age lived for 14 +/- 7 months. Two of the 11 dogs were alive at the time of publication, having survived for 3.5 and 4.5 years, respectively. We conclude that ACS with DCM are taurine-deficient and are responsive to taurine and carnitine supplementation. Whereas myocardial function did not return to normal in most dogs, it did improve enough to allow discontinuation of cardiovascular drug therapy and to maintain a normal quality of life for months to years.

	abstract = {Background: Macrothrombocytopenia is a well-known anomaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs), a breed also highly predisposed to develop myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Thromboelastography (TEG) has been shown to be a valuable instrument for whole blood hemostatic evaluation in dogs and correlates well with different physiologic and pathologic situations.
Objectives: We aimed to assess the influence of macrothrombocytopenia and the severity of MMVD on hemostatic function as measured by TEG.
Methods: Associations between TEG variables (R, K, a, MA, and G) and dog characteristics, heart rates, systolic blood pressures, MMVD severities (healthy, mild or moderate, and severe), echocardiographic variables, platelet variables (platelet count, mean platelet volume [MPV], and plateletcrit), and hematocrits were evaluated in 47 prospectively recruited privately owned CKCSs. Blood samples were analyzed using a computerized thromboelastograph and an Advia 2120 hematology analyzer.
Results: Univariable and multiple regression analyses showed an effect of left ven-tricular (LV) fractional shortening (FS\%) on all TEG variables, an effect of LV FS\% and age on TEG a, and an effect of LV FS\% and MPV on TEG MA and TEG G. TEG MA and G increased with increasing MPV, but the associations were generally weak. No significant differences were detected in the TEG variables between the MMVD severity groups
Conclusion: Macrothrombocytopenia and increased LV FS\%, of which the latter commonly increases in various positive inotropic states, were both associated with a more hypercoagulable hemostatic system, according to the TEG results, in the pre-sent study.},

Previous medical history included a high-grade soft tissue spindle cell sarcoma removed from the cranial sternal region one year before.On presentation at the referral hospital, the dog was tachypneic and dyspneic. The heart rhythm was regular and there was a soft left-sided systolic murmur. Echocardiography identified the presence of a mass significantly occluding left heart inflow, with no other lesions identified. Thoracic radiographs documented a localized alveolar pattern within the left caudal lung lobe. The size of the heart and pulmon-ary vessels were within normal limits, indicating a non-cardiogenic alveolar pat-tern.Given the clinical presentation of dyspnea and high index of suspicion of intra-cardiac neoplasia, the dog was considered to have a grave prognosis and therefore euthanized. Post-mortem gross and histopathologic examination revealed the pre-sence of a metastatic osteosarcoma tumor thrombus in the left atrium and pulmon-ary vein, metastatic osteosarcoma infiltrating the myocardium, lungs, the uveal tract of the right eye, and both adrenal glands. Whitney grade II myxomatous changes were noted on the mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets.This report describes an unusual intra-cardiac tumor thrombus in a dog present -ing with dyspnea. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels presenting with dyspnea often raise suspicion for myxomatous mitral valve disease. However, as demonstrated in this case, other more unusual causes of dyspnea should also be considered in the absence of classic clinical findings. 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in susceptibility to Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) of two breeds of dogs: English cocker spaniel and beagle. Three artificial infestations of ticks using a capsule on the back of the dogs were carried out at 15 day intervals. Six dogs of each breed were infested with 100 larvae, 50 nymphs and 20 adults (10 males and 10 females). Every 2 days, the ticks on the dogs were evaluated and the engorged ones counted and collected. The ticks were stored in climatic chambers and inspected every two days for 14 days. The following parameters were recorded: number of engorged ticks, engorgement period, percentage of ecdysis, female weight, conversion of body weight to eggs and larval hatchability. In the ticks recovered from the cocker spaniel, higher percentages of ecdysis of larvae and nymphs, greater number of adults attached and engorged and higher reproductive performance of the females (conversion to eggs and hatchability) were observed. The period of engorgement, number of engorged nymphs and weight of the females did not differ much by breed, but more larvae were attached and engorged in the beagle. In the two breeds, an effect of the successive infestations on the number of engorged larvae and nymphs was observed, which demonstrates the development of a response to the infestation in these stages. However, the percentage of ecdysis and the conversion to eggs was affected only in the more resistant beagles. Based on what was presented, it can be concluded that the animals of the race English cocker spaniel are more susceptible to R. sanguineus than the beagles and that the infestations affect the development of the tick, especially in resistant individuals.},

An American cocker spaniel pedigree showing Sry-negative XX sex reversal phenotype was genotyped with an intronic Lhx9 microsatellite marker. Segregation of the Lhx9 marker in the pedigree indicated that a mutation in canine Lhx9 is not likely to be the cause of Sry-negative XX sex reversal.

An infrared camera captures emission of heat and creates a color map in the form of a thermogram. Topical heat emission is influenced by localized disease processes as a result of autonomic nervous system imbalance. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of using thermography to identify changes in thermographic patterns associated with syringomyelia (SM) presence or absence in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with Chiari-like Malformation (CLM). Results In CKCS with CLM, MITI was most accurate at a texture distance of 6. Optimizing imaging feature sets produced a highest accuracy of 69.9\% (95\% CI: 59.5-79.0\%), with 81.3\% sensitivity and 57.8\% specificity for identifying the presence of syringomyelia. Conclusion Thermographic image analysis is a successful non-invasive, diagnostic test that can be used to screen for syringomyelia presence in a CKCS with CLM.},

Study design Experimental on 3D printed models. Methods The plating system was based on morphometric data obtained from CT. Plates were applied to models and impression material was measured under the plates at points of interest to define plate bone gap (PBG). Data on locking screw interference on plate application were also obtained. Results Eleven elbows models were plated. Statistical analysis to assess for any difference in PBG measurements between left and right humuri revealed two loci (3 and 17) under the lateral plate and two loci (3 and 17) under the medial plate. On cumulate portion analysis, 67\% of lateral plate loci and 80\% of medial plate loci had a PBG of {\textless}= 2 mm respectively. An incidence of 2.1\% (3/143) screw interference occurred. Conclusion Design of a contoured plating system for application to humeral models from spaniels with HIF and its application with objective measurement of PBG is described. The majority of the loci measured under both lateral and medial plates had a BPG of {\textless}= 2 mm and the incidence of locking screw interference on plate application was low. Clinical significance This novel system may have application for the stabilization of humeral condylar fractures in spaniels avoiding the need for plate contouring and minimizing the incidence of locking screw interference.},

However, testicular development has been reported in SRY-negative XX sex reversed humans. XX sex reversal of the American cocker spaniel, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, may be a homolog of this disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Sry high mobility group (HMG) box is present in genomic DNA of affected dogs. Conserved Sry HMG box and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) sequences were used as primers in polymerase chain reactions. A 167 bp Y-specific canine Sry HMG box sequence was cloned from genomic DNA of normal male dogs. Internal primers generated a 104 bp Sry HMG box product from normal males, but not from females or XX sex reversed dogs. Parallel reactions generated an HPRT product from all dogs. Results indicate that the Sry HMG box is absent in genomic DNA of XX sex reversed dogs. We speculate that activation of the testis differentiation cascade in the absence of Sry in this model is due to a mutant autosomal gene. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The calculated parameters of the CKCS were different from all parameters of mesaticephalic dogs but were the same as parameters from brachycephalic dogs. However, the CKCS had a wider braincase in relation to length than in other brachycephalic breeds. Studies of the etiology of the chiari-like malformation in the CKCS should therefore focus on brachycephalic control groups. As Chari-like malformation has only been reported in brachycephalic breeds, its etiology could be associated with a higher grade of brachycephaly, meaning a shorter longitudinal extension of the skull. This has been suggested for other breeds. (C) 2011 Veterinary Radiology \& Ultrasound, Vol. 52, No. 4, 2011, pp 436-440.},

Four key dogs representing four major breeding lines consistently occurred within the individual pedigrees. if a dog had more than five of its eight great-grandparents descended from these four lines there was a greater chance of it having syringomyelia. The data from this preliminary study suggest that occipital bone hypoplasia is hereditary in the cavalier King Charles spaniel and that its inheritance is more likely to be autosomal recessive because both dam and sire must be inbred descendants from certain lines.

However, little is known about pulmonary blood volume (PBV), blood pulmonary transit time (PTT), and the regulation of these.
Objectives: To measure and evaluate the relationships of PBV, forward stroke volume (FSV), and heart rate normalized blood pulmonary transit time (nPTT) in healthy dogs and dogs with MR.
Animals: Thirty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; 11 healthy, 4 in modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 11 in class II, and 7 in CHF.
Methods: Heart rate normalized PTTs were measured by radionuclide angiocardiography. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic diameter, left atrial/aortic root ratio, and FSV were measured by echocardiography. PBV and pulmonary blood volume index (PBVI) were calculated by established formulas.
Results: PBVI was 308 +/- 56 (mean +/- SD) mL/m(2) for healthy dogs, 287 +/- 51mL/m(2) in NYHA class I, 360 +/- 66 mL/m(2) in Class II, and 623 +/- 232 mL/m(2) in CHF (P - .0008). Heart rate normalized PTT, not FSV, was a predictor of PBV (r - 0.92 and 0.02, respectively).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Increased PBV, not decreased FSV, is the main cause of increased nPTT in MR. Increased nPTT can be used as an indicator of abnormal cardiopulmonary function in dogs with MR.},

A large heterogeneous mass occupied the entire left side of the thorax, silhouetting with the diaphragm and the liver. On ultrasonography of the abdomen, a mass in the cranial pole of the left kidney, a mass caudal to the left kidney and several masses compatible with mesenteric lymphadenopathy were identified. Euthanasia was advised because of the suspicion of neoplasia with extensive metastatic spread. A necropsy was performed and histopathological examination of the masses revealed the presence of an undifferentiated sarcoma with multiple organ involvement.

	abstract = {Background: There is an association between Chiari malformations, syringomyelia (CMSM) and tethered cord syndrome (TCS) in people, suggesting Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with CMSM could also have TCS. Currently there are no data on the position of the caudal spinal cord structures in CKCS.
Objective: To describe and compare location of spinal cord termination in CKCS with weight-matched controls and to examine the relationship between SM and spinal cord termination.
Animals: Thirty-nine CKCS and 33 controls with thoracolumbar MRIs; 34 of 39 CKCS also had cervical MRIs.
Methods: Blinded retrospective study. Spinal cord and dural sac termination were determined from T2-weighted sagittal and transverse images and half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo sequences. Intra-observer reliability was determined using kappa analysis. Presence of SM was compared with location of spinal cord and dural sac termination.
Results: Intra-observer reliability was moderate for identifying spinal cord termination (Kappa = 0.6) and good for dural sac termination (Kappa = 0.8). The spinal cord terminated at lumbar vertebra 6 (L6) in 1, 7 (L7) in 22, and sacrum in 16 CKCS versus 9 at L6, 23 at L7, 1 at sacrum in controls. Spinal cord (P {\textless} .001) and dural sac (P = .002) termination were significantly more caudal in CKCS compared to controls. The presence of thoracolumbar SM was associated with more caudal dural sac termination in CKCS (P = .03).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The relationship between TL SM and possible spinal cord tethering because of a more caudal dural sac termination should be investigated.},

	abstract = {Objective-To evaluate the effect of age and body weight on several neurohumoral variables that are commonly altered in heart failure in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
Animals-17 healthy privately owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 10 males and 7 females, ranging in age from 0.4 to 9.7 years, and ranging in body weight from 6.6 to 12.2 kg.
Procedure-The clinical condition of the dogs was evaluated by physical examination, thoracic radiography, and echocardiography. Plasma nitrate and nitrite (P-NN), N-terminal atrial natriuretic and brain natriuretic peptides (NT-ANP and BNP respectively), endothelin (ET-1), urine cyclic guanosine monophosphate (U-cGMP), and urine nitrate and nitrite (U-NN) concentrations were analyzed.
Results-Plasma concentrations of NT-ANP and P-NN increased significantly with age, but plasma NT-ANP and P-NN also correlated significantly, irrespective of age. A modest increase of left atrial size did not explain the increase of NT-ANP and P-NN with age. Concentration of ET-1 correlated positively with heart rate; heart rate did not change with age. Weight had a negative impact on NT-ANP P-NN, and U-cGMP concentrations and left atrial relative size.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Age-matched controls are essential for evaluation of NT-ANP and P-NN concentrations and left atrial size. Weight may alter reference values of plasma NT-ANP P-NN, and urine cGMP concentrations. Natriuretic peptides can be used as further evidence that heart failure exists. The increased plasma concentrations of NT-ANP (but not BNP) and P-NN with aging reflect neurohumoral physiologic changes that must be distinguished from pathologic changes in patients with heart failure.},

	abstract = {There is a high incidence oi mitral value prolapse (MVP), an abnormal displacement of one or both mitral valve leaflets during systole, in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). In humans, MVP is known to be associated with a low magnesium status. In this study, the plasma magnesium concentration was measured in 30 CKCS without heart failure. It was also investigated whether MPV-severity and degree of regurgitation correlated with plasma magnesium and a number of parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, and whether 4 weeks magnesium supplementation affected plasma magnesium or the high renin/low aldosterone profile associated with MVP. A high prevalence of hypomagnesemia was observed: plasma concentrations {\textless} 0.70 mmol/l were found in 15 dogs (50 \%) before and in 12 dogs (40 \%) after 4 weeks magnesium supplementation. The mean plasma level was 0.69 +/- 0.07 mmol/l before and 0.71 +/- 0.07 mmol/l after magnesium (P = 0.22). Plasma magnesium concentrations did not correlate with MVP-severity and degree of regurgitation. Plasma aldosterone levels correlated negatively with MVP-severity and positively with the degree of regurgitation, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activities correlated negatively with the degree of regurgitation. Magnesium supplementation had no effects on renin and aldosterone nor on the ratio between the two. In conclusion, many CKCS without heart failure have hypomagnesemia whether they are fed supplementary magnesium or not - a finding which may be associated with the high prevalence of MVP in this breed. Further studies, however, are needed to clarify the role of a low magnesium status in canine MVP.},

No other abnormalities were noted on physical or ophthalmic examination, ocular ultrasound, complete bloodwork, or thoracic radiography. Skull computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, focal, smoothly irregular, cavitated, expansile bony lesion involving the left caudal maxillary and left frontal bones. Biopsies, obtained through a frontal sinusotomy approach to preserve the left globe integrity, demonstrated normal reactive trabecular bone with locally extensive fibrosis. Calvarial hyperostosis was diagnosed based upon appearance on imaging, lesion unilaterality, absence of mandibular involvement, and histopathology. Six months after initial presentation, skull CT was repeated and marked reduction in the degree of frontal bone thickening was demonstrated with complete resolution of cavitations. There was marked clinical improvement with mild, nonpainful exophthalmos, and lateral globe deviation OS on ophthalmic examination. Eleven months after initial presentation, there was complete resolution of the frontal bone lesion with mild thickening of the left calvarial bones on repeat skull CT. There was no exophthalmos or globe deviation present on clinical ophthalmic examination. The proliferative osteopathic lesion was self-resolving with resolution of the exophthalmos and has not recurred to date.

The method of the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP), an alternative technique that is based on hip joint laxity, provides a quantitative assessment, the distraction index (DI), of the likelihood of the development of CHID because of increased laxity in the hip joint. Linear regression analysis showed that, across many breeds of dog, the incidence of CHD, as defined by the OFA, is positively correlated with the mean DI, the determination coefficient (r(2)) being 26\%. We used families of Boykin spaniels (BSs) to determine the level of joint laxity in the breed and to conduct an initial whole-genome screening to identify markers that co-segregate with increased joint laxity. Although there was a positive correlation between the incidence of hip dysplasia and increased joint laxity, we did not find significant linkage in the 28 BSs that underwent genotyping, likely owing to the small size of the pedigree.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test the hypothesis that pain associated with syringomyelia in dogs is dependent upon size and involvement of the dorsal part of the spinal cord.
METHODS: Masked observers determined syrinx dimensions and precise location within the spinal cord on magnetic resonance images of 55 cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia. After removal of masking, syrinx size and location were compared between the cohorts of dogs that exhibited pain with those that did not.
RESULTS: Maximum syrinx width was the strongest predictor of pain, scratching behaviour and scoliosis in dogs with syringomyelia. Both pain and syrinx size were positively correlated with syrinxes located in the dorsal half of the spinal cord.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Large syrinxes associated with damage to the dorsal part of the spinal cord are associated with persistent pain suggesting that the pain behaviour expressed by this group of patients is likely to be "neuropathic pain," resulting from disordered neural processing in the damaged dorsal horn. As such it is likely that conventional analgesic medication may be ineffective.},

	abstract = {With aggregometry, increased platelet activity has been reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) without mitral regurgitation (MR). In contrast, dogs with MR have been found to have decreased platelet activity. The purpose of this study was to test an easy bedside test of platelet function (the Platelet Function Analyzer [PFA-100((R))]) to see if it could detect an increase in platelet activity in CKCS without MR and a decrease in platelet activity in CKCS with MR. This study included 101 clinically healthy dogs {\textgreater}1 year of age: 15 control dogs of different breeds and 86 CKCS. None of the dogs received medication or had a history of bleeding. The PFA-100 evaluates platelet function in anticoagulated whole blood under high shear stress. Results are given as closure times (CT): the time it takes before a platelet plug occludes a hole in a membrane coated by agonists. The CT with collagen and adenosine-diphosphate as agonists was similar in control dogs (median 62 seconds; interquartile interval 55-66 seconds) and CKCS with no or minimal MR (55; 52-64 seconds). The CT was higher in CKCS with mild MR (regurgitant jet occupying 15-50\% of the left atrial area) (75; 60-84 seconds; P = .0007) and in CKCS with moderate to severe MR (jet {\textgreater}50\%) (87; 66-102 seconds; P {\textless} .0001). CKCS with mild, moderate, and severe, clinically inapparent MR have decreased platelet function. The previous finding of increased platelet reactivity in nonthrombocytopenic CKCS without MR could not be reproduced with the PFA-100 device.},

Significant differences in plasma concentrations of ir-ANP were not found between clinically normal dogs (New York Heart Association functional class O), dogs with only cardiac murmur (class I), and dogs with echocardiographic evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and ventricular dilatation (class II), Dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular dilatation and clinical signs of congestion (classes III and IV) were found to have significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) increased plasma concentration of ir-ANP. Overall, moderate degree of association was found between plasma concentration of ir-ANP and left atrial and left ventricular diameters (Pearson's r 0.65, 0.60, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001), as well as heart rate (r = 0.47, P {\textless} 0.01).

Procedures A retrospective record review identified three dogs with circular retinal plaques that underwent SLO and OCT; in two of the three dogs, FA was also completed. Morphologic changes, lesion measurements, and angiogram characteristics were documented. An English springer spaniel with bilateral retinal dysplasia that had undergone SLO, OCT, and FA was used for comparison. Results Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of the retriever dogs revealed circular retinal plaques with a dark periphery located in the tapetal retina. OCT revealed a thickening of the nerve fiber layer corresponding to the circular pattern observed on SLO. Within the circular plaque, the retina was predominantly of normal architecture. FA revealed variable hypofluorescence of both the rim and the center of the circular lesion throughout the early angiogram phases. In the late recirculation phase, small multifocal areas of hyperfluorescence were observed. OCT of geographic retinal dysplasia in the English springer spaniel revealed disorganization of both inner and outer retinal layers, and retinal detachment. Conclusions Circular plaques observed in the tapetal retina are predominantly formed by a thickening of inner retina, while retinal dysplasia has disorganization of both inner and outer retinal layers. Further etiologic research is needed, including pedigree mapping to determine whether retinal plaques are an acquired or inherited condition.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
To ascertain whether cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) have a proportionately smaller caudal fossa compared with other small dogs and with Labradors. To evaluate if cerebellar herniation in CKCS correlates with caudal fossa volume.
Methods:
In this retrospective study, three-dimensional images were created from magnetic resonance imaging brain series of 117 dogs (split into three groups: CKCS, Labradors and small breeds) from which the volumes of the fossae and brain parenchyma were calculated. These volumes were transformed into percentages of total cranial cavity and parenchyma volumes, respectively. The percentages were statistically compared among the groups. The percentage of herniated cerebellum in the CKCS was compared using linear regression with the caudal fossa and parenchyma percentages.
Results:
Cavalier King Charles spaniels had a proportionately smaller caudal fossa compared with Labradors (P=0 center dot 002) but not to small breeds (P=0 center dot 103). Their caudal fossa parenchyma was proportionately the same volume as Labradors (P=0 center dot 976) but greater than small breeds (P=0 center dot 005). No relationship was found for the per cent of cerebellum herniated.
Clinical Significance:
The results support mesoderm insufficiency or craniosynostosis as the pathogenesis of Chiari-like malformation (CM) in CKCS. It presents evidence for overcrowding of the caudal fossa due to a mismatch of brain parenchyma and fossa volumes as to why CKCS and not other small dogs are affected.},

Whole-body barometric plethysmography was used to categorize SDB. Results All dogs presented with multiple episodes of stertorous breathing, choking, and apnea during sleep. Severe nasal septal deviation, aberrant nasal turbinates, and soft palate elongation and thickening were noted on computed tomography and rhinoscopy of each dog. Whole-body barometric plethysmography measurements during sleep (in 3 dogs) documented periods of choking, snoring, and apnea. Treatment combined laser turbinectomy, folding flap palatoplasty, tonsillectomy, laryngeal sacculectomy, and cuneiform process resection. All dogs improved in terms of incidence and severity of sleep apnea within 1 week, with 4 of 5 dogs achieving complete resolution. Conclusion The objective measurements used to characterize SDB in this population of CKCS provided some evidence to support an obstructive cause for this condition, which improved with surgical treatment. Clinical significance Sleep-disordered breathing in the CKCS is a different clinical presentation of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome.

	doi = {10.1111/vde.12248},
	abstract = {BackgroundPrimary secretory otitis media (PSOM) is a disease reported in the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). The diagnosis of PSOM has been made based only on visualization of a bulging tympanic membrane and mucus in the middle ear post-myringotomy. No additional tests have been evaluated for the diagnosis of PSOM; CKCSs with early disease may have been missed.
Hypothesis/ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to compare otoscopy, tympanometry, pneumotoscopy and tympanic bulla ultrasonography, using computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard for the diagnosis of PSOM in the CKCS.
AnimalsSixty CKCSs with clinical signs suggestive of PSOM.
MethodsOtoscopy, CT scan, tympanic bulla ultrasonography, tympanometry and pneumotoscopy were performed; those CKCSs with a soft tissue density in the middle ear identified on CT had a myringotomy and middle ear flush.
ResultsForty-three (72\%) CKCSs had PSOM (30 bilateral, 13 unilateral). A large bulging pars flaccida was identified in only those CKCS with PSOM (specificity of 100\%); however, only 21 of 73 ears with PSOM had a large bulging pars flaccida (sensitivity of 29\%). Sensitivity and specificity for tympanometry, pneumotoscopy and tympanic bulla ultrasonography were (84\%, 47\%), (75\%, 79\%) and (67\%, 47\%), respectively.
Conclusions and clinical importanceBased on these results a large bulging pars flaccida indicates the presence of PSOM, whereas a flat pars flaccida may be present in CKCS that have PSOM as well as those that do not. In CKCSs with a flat pars flaccida none of the above diagnostic tests can be recommended in place of CT scan for the diagnosis of PSOM.

ContexteL'otite moyenne primaire secretante (PSOM) est une maladie decrite chez le Cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). Le diagnostic de PSOM a ete base sur la seule visualisation d'une membrane tympanique bombee et de la presence de mucus dans l'oreille moyenne post-myringotomie. Aucun test supplementaire n'a ete evalue pour le diagnostic de PSOM; les CKCs atteint de maladie primaire ont pu etre ecarte.
Hypotheses/ObjectifsL'objectif de cette etude etait de comparer l'otoscopie, la tympanometrie, la pneumotoscopie et l'echographie de la bulle tympanique avec le scanner (computed tomography) en tant que gold standard pour le diagnostic de PSOM chez le CKC.
SujetsSoixante CKCs presentant des signes cliniques evocateurs de PSOM.
MethodesL'otoscopie, un scanner, une echographie des bulles tympaniques, une tympanometrie et une pneumotoscopie ont ete realises; les CKCs avec une densite tissulaire de tissu mou au niveau de l'oreille moyenne identifie par scanner ont eu une myringotomie et un nettoyage de l'oreille moyenne.
ResultatsQuarante trois (72\%) des CKCs avaient un PSMO (30 bilaterale et 13 unilaterale). Une large pars flaccida protuberante a ete identifiee seulement chez les CKCs avec PSOM (specificite de 100\%); cependant seulement 21 des 73 oreilles avec PSOM avaient une large pars flaccida proeminente (sensibilite de 29\%). La sensibilite et la specificite de la tympanometrie, pneumotoscopie et echographie de la bulle tympanique etaient (84\%, 47\%), (75\%, 79\%) et (67\%, 47\%) respectivement.
Conclusions et importance cliniqueBase sur ces resultats, une large pars flaccida proeminente indique la presence d'une PSOM tandis que une pars flaccida plane peut etre presente chez les CKC qui presente un PSOM ou non. Chez les CKCs avec une pars flaccida plane, aucun des tests precedents ne peuvent etre recommande a la place du scanner pour le diagnostic de PSOM.
Resumen
Introduccionla otitis media primaria secretoria (PSOM) es una enfermedad descrita en los perros de raza Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). El diagnostico de PSOM se realiza basado en la visualizacion de una membrana timpanica elevada y la presencia de moco en el oido medio tras miringotomia. No se han evaluado otras pruebas para el diagnostico de PSOM; perros de raza CKCS con enfermedad temprana no se han diagnosticado.
Hipotesis/Objetivosel objetivo de este estudio fue comparar la otoscopia, timpanometria, neumotoscopia y ultrasonografia de la bulla timpanica utilizando tomografia computarizada (CT) como la prueba estandar de referencia para el diagnostico de PSOM en perros CKCS.
Animales60 perros de raza CKCS con signos clinicos indicativos de PSOM.
Metodosse desarrollaron otoscopia, exploracion mediante CT, ultrasonografia de la bulla timpanica, timpanometria, y neumotosocopia; a aquellos perros de raza CKCS con una densidad de tejido blando en el oido medio identificadas por CT se les realizo miringotomia y lavado del oido medio.
Resultados43 (72 por ciento) de perros de raza CKCS tuvieron PSOM (30 bilateral, 13 unilateral). Una pars flacida prominente fue identificada solo en perros con PSOM (especificidad del 100\%); sin embargo solo 21 de 73 oidos con PSOM tuvieron una pars flacida prominente (sensibilidad del 29\%).La sensibilidad y la especificidad de la timpanometria, neumostoscopia, y ultrasonografia de la bulla timpanica fueron (84\%, 47\%), (75\%, 79\%) y (27\%, 47\%), respectivamente.
Conclusiones e importancia clinicabasados en estos resultados una pars flacida prominente indica la presencia de PSOM, mientras que la pars flacida aplanada puede estar presente en perros de raza CKCS que tienen PSOM tanto como en animales que no la tienen. En perros de razas CKCS con pars flacida aplanada ninguno de los metodos diagnosticos esta recomendado en lugar de la exploracion mediante CT para el diagnostico de PSOM.
Zusammenfassung
HintergrundEine primare sekretorische Otitis media (PSOM) ist eine Krankheit, die beim Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) beschrieben ist. Die Diagnose einer PSOM wurde bisher einfach durch Visualisierung eines vorgewolbten Trommelfells und Schleim im Mittelohr nach einer Myringotomie gestellt. Es wurden bisher keine zusatzlichen Tests zur Diagnose einer PSOM durchgefuhrt; CKCS mit der Krankheit im Fruhstadium konnten dabei ubersehen worden sein.
Hypothese/ZieleDas Ziel dieser Studie war es Otoskopie, Tympanometrie, Pneumotoskopie und Ultrasonographie der Bulla tympanica zu vergleichen und Computertomografie (CT) als den Goldstandard fur die Diagnose einer PSOM beim CKCS zu verwenden.
TiereSechzig CKCSs mit klinischer Symptomatik in Richtung PSOM.
MethodeOtoskopie, CT Scan, Ultrasonographie der Bulla tympanica, Tympanometrie und Pneumotoskopie wurden durchgefuhrt; bei jenen CKCS mit einem Weichteilschatten im Mittelohr, welcher mittels CT identifiziert wurde, wurde eine Myringotomie und eine Mittelohrspulung durchgefuhrt.
ErgebnisseDreiundvierzig (72\%) der CKCS hatten eine PSOM (30 bilateral, 13 unilateral). Eine gro ss e vorgewolbte Pars flaccida wurde nur bei jenen CKCS mit PSOM identifiziert (Spezifitat von 100\%); allerdings hatten nur 21 von 73 Ohren mit PSOM eine gro ss e vorgewolbte Pars flaccida (Sensibilitat von 29\%). Sensibilitat und Spezifitat fur Tympanometrie betrugen 84\% bzw 47\%, fur Pneumotoskopie 75\% bzw 79\% und fur die Ultrasonographie der Bulla tympanica 67\% bzw 47\%.
Schlussfolgerungen und klinische BedeutungAufgrund dieser Ergebnisse kann man sagen, dass eine gro ss e vorgewolbte Pars flaccida das Vorhandensein einer PSOM bedeutet, wahrend eine flache Pars flaccida bei CKCS vorkommen kann, die PSOM haben oder auch nicht. Bei CKCS mit einer flachen Pars flaccida kann keiner der obigen diagnostischen Tests anstelle des CT Scans zur Diagnose der PSOM empfohlen werden.},

Animals: This study involved 42 healthy adult ESS. Methods: Animals were prospectively recruited from a general practice population in the United Kingdom. Dogs were examined twice, at least 12 months apart, to exclude dogs with progressive cardiac disease. Mitral annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler imaging mitral annular velocities and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiographic left ventricular longitudinal strain and strain rate were measured. intraoperator and intraobserver variability were examined and reference intervals were calculated. The potential effects of body weight, age and heart rate on these variables were examined.
Results: intraoperator and intraobserver variability was {\textless}10\% for all parameters except tissue Doppler imaging E' (the peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion as determined by pulsed wave Doppler) and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiographic variables, which were all {\textless}20\%. Thirty-nine dogs were used to create reference intervals. Significant (but mostly weak) effects of age, heart rate and body weight on were detected. Reference intervals were similar to previously published values in different breeds.

The presence and severity of the condition were independent of gender but correlated positively with age and negatively with bodyweight. The degree of mitral valve prolapse at screening correlated with the regurgitation status (murmur intensity and size of the regurgitant jets) at re-examination and with the percentage increase in the left ventricular end diastolic diameter over the three-year period.

Material and methods: From 2006 to 2016 a total of 339 asymptomatic CKCSs from all over Germany were included. Age ranged from 3 months to 11 years (mean 3.72 years +/- 2.17 years). T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the head and cervical spine were obtained. Results: Overall, 163 out of 339 (48.1 \%) CKCSs showed evidence of syringomyelia. The results (odds ratio of 1.27 per year; p {\textless} 0.0001) corroborate the findings of other studies, in which the risk of developing syringomyelia increases with age. Conclusion and clinical relevance: In conclusion, around half of the dogs within the German CKCS population are affected by syringomyelia. The prevalence of syringomyelia of the German CKCS population is similar to that of the British CKCS population, which is subjected to breeding strategies on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging investigations.},

	abstract = {Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations of lobular dissecting hepatitis (LDH) were performed in nine American cocker spaniel dogs. Histological examination showed diffuse fibrosis with weak inflammatory reaction of extensive neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the myofibroblastic cells positive for anti-a-smooth muscle actin and anti-vimentin antibodies produced reticular and collagen fibers and brought about the dissection of hepatic cords and diffuse disappearance of hepatocytes. Reticular fibers invading between hepatocytes and the surrounding small group of hepatocytes were strongly positive for anti-collagen type III and anti-collagen type IV antibodies. The positivity to anti-fibronectin and anti-laminin antibodies was frequently continuous on the basement membrane of the sinusoids of the remaining hepatic cords and between the hepatocytes. Positive findings for anti-E-cadherin antibody were not observed between the hepatocytes showing positive findings for anti-collagen type III and anti-collagen type IV antibodies. These results may explain the expression of fibronectin and laminin that occurs prior to the invasion of reticular fibers between hepatocytes. The present study further suggests that expression of an extracellular matrix mainly containing fibronectin and laminin between the hepatocytes and proliferation of collagen fibers and reticular fibers have a major role in the rupture of the hepatic cords and disappearance of hepatocytes.},

In Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). a breed predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease, there is a high prevalence of hypomagnesemia and platelet anomalies. such as thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate platelet aggregation responses in CKCS and to determine the relationship between the platelet aggregation response and serum magnesium concentration. MVP, mitral regurgitation (MR). and platelet count. In 19 CKCS with MVP and 7 control dogs (not CKCS). the platelet aggregation response to 3 different agonists was compared. The CKCS with {\textgreater} 100,000 platelets/muL (n = 10) had a significantly higher maximum aggregation response with regard to all tested agonists than the CKCS with {\textless} 100,000 platelets/muL (n = 9) and control dogs (n = 7). The CKCS with {\textless} 100,000 platelets/muL had a platelet aggregation response similar to the control dogs. There was no correlation between degree of MVP and platelet aggregation response. platelet diameter increased (P = .006) and serum magnesium concentration decreased (P = .04) with lower platelet concentration. In conclusion. CKCS with MVP appeared to separate into 2 groups-1 group with {\textless} 100,000 platelets/muL, normal platelet aggregation. low serum magnesium concentration, and enlarged platelets, and another group with {\textless} 100,000 plarelets/muL. increased platelet aggregation. and normal serum magnesium concentration and platelet size.},

	abstract = {Two thousand questionnaires were distributed randomly via the Kennel Club (UK) to owners of purebred English Cocker Spaniels (ECSs). Owners were asked to give details about the ECSs they owned: age, sex, neuter status, coat colour. They were also asked to indicate whether their dog showed aggression (on a 1-5 scale; 1, never or almost never, 5, always or almost always) in any of 13 situations. These were: aggression towards strange dogs (Al), towards strangers approaching the dog (A2), towards persons approaching/visiting the home (A3), towards persons approaching the owner away from home (A4), towards children in the household (A5), towards other dogs in the household (A6), when the owner gives attention to other person or animal (A7), toward owner or member of owner's family (A8), when disciplined (A9), when reached for or handled (A10), when in restricted spaces (A11), at meal times/defending food (A12) and, suddenly and without apparent reason (A13).
A total of 1008 (50.4\%) replies was received, of which 932 (owning 1109 dogs) were suitable for analysis. Solid colour ECSs were significantly more likely to show aggression than particolours in 12 out of the 13 situations (A2-A13) and red/goldens were more likely to show aggression than blacks in situations A1, A4, A5 and A7-A13 inclusive. Males were significantly more likely to show aggression than females in situations A1, A8, A9 and A10 while females were significantly more likely to show aggression towards other dogs in the household (A6). When comparing ECSs which had been neutered before signs of aggression were apparent, with entires, neutered females were found more likely to show aggression towards children in the household (A5), Cluster analysis revealed six groups of associated variables; these were labelled, 'protective (of itself and owner)', 'protective (of territory)', 'intraspecific (unfamiliar dogs)', 'competitive', 'possessive', and 'dominance-type' aggression. Most dogs showed 'protective (of territory)' aggression (45.7\%) while 'dominance-type' aggression was the least common (11.7\%).
The results suggest a genetic and neuroendocrine basis for the within-breed differences in aggression. Neutering was not found to be useful as a preventative measure for aggression. From the cluster analysis, there was some evidence that so-called 'rage' syndrome, a condition often reported in the breed and one which is characterised by sudden and unpredictable aggression, is an expression of social dominance, rather than being a separate or pathological phenomenon. Follow-up projects are now underway and it is hoped they will lead to a better understanding of all types of canine aggression, and provide an answer as to whether or not 'rage' truly exists as a distinct phenomenon.},

Cardiac murmurs were present in 59 of the dogs and the intensity of the systolic cardiac murmur, assessed by auscultation (grade 1-6), was correlated (P {\textless} .001) to the severity of CVD (heart failure class) and to the echocardiographical dimensions of the heart (left atrial ratio, La/Ao-d, and left ventricular end diastolic diameter, LVEDD) (both P {\textless} .001). The heart sounds and duration of electromechanical systole (Q-S2) were investigated in all dogs using measurements obtained from PCG recordings. Normal regression equations describing the relation between heart rate and systolic intervals (Q-S1, Q-S2 and S1-S2) were established based on observations in 11 normal control Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. The total electromechanical systole (Q-S2), Q-S1, and S1-S2 intervals in the 59 dogs were related to the corresponding normal regression equation, A shortening of Q-S2 and S1-S2 intervals were found in dogs belonging to heart failure class I (Q-S2; P {\textless} .01 and S1-S2; P {\textless} .05), class II, and classes III and IV (both P {\textless} .001). The ratio of the amplitudes of the first (S1) and second heart sounds (S2) measured on the PCG recordings was found to be increased in dogs belonging to class I (P {\textless} .01), class II, and classes III and IV (both P {\textless} .001). The relationship between cardiac dimensions (LVEDD and La/Ao-d) and S1a/ S2a ratio was described by quadratic regression and found to be significant for both parameters (LVEDD: P {\textless} .001, R(2) = .54 and La/Ao-d; P {\textless} .001, R(2) = .63). The presence of a third heart sound (S3) was detected, using PCG, in 21 of the 68 dogs. The proportion of dogs exhibiting 83 increased with heart failure class (and increasing cardiac dimensions) (P {\textless} .001). These findings were confirmed by observations in 13 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with cardiac failure progressing from heart failure class I to class II (Mean LVEDD from 30.2 to 35.2 mm and mean La/Ao-d from 1.09 to 1.43), An increase in intensity of the heart murmur, assessed by auscultation, increase in the ratio of the amplitudes of S1 and S2, as well as a shortening in Q-S2 and S1-S2 intervals (all P {\textless} .01) were found in these dogs. None of these dogs showed an S3 in heart failure class I, but 7 of the 13 dogs developed an S3 in class II.},

	abstract = {Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) often have idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia. In affected dogs, the thrombocytes often are large, and it has been speculated that the condition could be an inherited macrothrombocytopenia. The aim of this study was to examine the inheritance of idiopathic, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in CKCS. Sixteen families (both parents and greater than or equal to3 offspring) of privately owned CKCS were included. There were 105 clinically healthy dogs (50 from Denmark and 55 from Sweden): 81 offspring and 26 parents (2 dogs had both roles). Because autoanalyzers have difficulty counting large platelets, the platelets were counted manually, with a counting chamber. Platelet counts were not influenced by age, gender, or heart murmur status. Thrombocytopenia (less than or equal to 100,000 platelets/muL) was found in 46\% of the parents. The pedigrees indicated that thrombocytopenia segregated as an autosomal recessive trait and that 100,000 platelets/muL was appropriate as a lower limit of normal. Affected offspring were found in all families, showing that all of the included parents were at least carriers. Therefore, the expected segregation ratios (which were in good accordance with the observed ones) were 1 : 0, 1 : 1, and 1 : 3 for the 3 crosses: affected X affected, normal X affected, and normal X normal. Within a given cross, the mean parental platelet count had no influence on the platelet counts of the offspring. We conclude that idiopathic, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in CKCS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The condition most likely constitutes an inherited macrothrombocytopenia in dogs.},

Methods. An autosomal recessive form of progressive hereditary nephritis (HN) was studied in 10 affected, 3 obligate carrier, anti 4 unaffected English cocker spaniel (ECS) dogs. Clinical, pathological, and ultrastructural features of the disease were characterized. Expression of basement membrane (BM) proteins was examined with an immunohistochemical technique using monospecific antibodies.
Results, Affected dogs had proteinuria and juvenile-onset chronic renal failure, Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and multilamellation typical of HN were observed in all renal specimens obtained from proteinuric dogs, and severity of GEM ultrastructural abnormalities varied with the clinical stage of disease. Expression of alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) chains was totally absent in the kidney of affected dogs. Expression of alpha 5(IV) and alpha 6(IV) chains was normal in Bowman's capsule, collecting tubular BM and epidermal BM of affected dogs, The alpha 5(IV) chain was not expressed in distal tubular BM of affected dogs. Expression of a alpha(IV) chains was markedly reduced but not absent, and expression of alpha 6(IV) chains was present in GBM of affected dogs. Expression of alpha 1-alpha 2(IV) chains in GBM of affected dogs was increased. Features of obligate carriers were similar to those of unaffected dogs.
Conclusions. We conclude that HN in ECS dogs is a naturally occurring animal model of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. However, it differs from human disease in the persistence of alpha 5(IV) chains in GEM and in the appearance of alpha 6(IV) chains in GBM.},

	abstract = {CASE DESCRIPTION
A 14-year-old spayed female American Cocker Spaniel with bilateral otitis media and no evidence of cardiovascular instability was anesthetized to allow performance of a deep ear flush.
CLINICAL FINDINGS
Otoscopic examination of the left ear revealed evidence of chronic inflammation; the ear was flushed with sterile saline (0.9\% NaCl) solution. Examination of the right ear revealed more severe chronic inflammation than in the left ear, including a ruptured tympanum (timing of rupture unknown). The right ear was flushed with sterile saline solution, and several drops of otic medication were instilled. During infusion of saline solution, the ECG revealed a rapid decrease in heart rate until no more electrical activity was noted. Pulse also ceased to be detectable via pulse oximetry and femoral artery palpation.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME
Isoflurane was discontinued immediately after recognition of cardiac arrest. Shortly after, atropine (0.04 mg/kg [ 0.02 mg/lb]) and epinephrine (0.3 mg/kg [ 0.14 mg/lb]) were administered IV, chest compressions and ventilation were performed for 2 to 3 minutes, and 3 boluses (each 5 mL/kg) of lactated Ringer solution were administered IV. The dog was extubated 8 minutes after anesthesia was discontinued, and its recovery was monitored for the next 5 hours. No further incidents of cardiac arrest occurred after recovery from anesthesia.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE
This case represented a rarely documented potential complication associated with otic manipulation in a dog: cardiac arrest secondary to stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Veterinarians should be prepared for and warn clients of this possibility prior to otic flushing.},

The disease appears to be more severe and have an earlier onset with increased inbreeding, especially when breeding from affected dogs. The family tree of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) appears to be a different subset of the CKCS population, although some overlap was observed. Idiopathic epilepsy is more frequent in lines originating from whole-color dogs. Selection for coat color is believed to have influenced the development of both occipital hypoplasia with secondary SM and IE.

Hormonal investigations showed features suggestive of an abnormality of steroidogenesis. Histopathology revealed features similar to canine recurrent flank alopecia (CRFA) and follicular dysplasia associated with abnormal melanization, as in colour dilution alopecia, although the clinical features did not correlate with those conditions. Dietary changes improved coat and skin quality in most of the cases in this series but the role of the diet was not investigated further. This study suggests that hair loss in IWS is influenced by dietary factors and sexual hormones. Abnormalities of the steroidogenic pathways may contribute to the severity of the condition.},

	abstract = {Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a parasitic zoonosis occurring in most European countries and also emerging in parts of Asia and North America. AE is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis in intermediate and also in accidental hosts. The principal definitive host is the red fox, but domestic dogs and cats are also potential definitive hosts. Several species of rodents serve as intermediate hosts of this parasite. However, there are also some species acing as accidental intermediate hosts, among them dogs. Since the late 1980s cases of canine AE have been diagnosed. Here, we present a case of canine AE in a two-year old female intact German spaniel from Thuringia, Central Germany. The dog was used as a hunting dog and presented to a small animal clinic for subacute lethargy and inappetence. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast computed tomography (CT) scan were performed and revealed intrahepatic lesions. Multinodular changes of the liver and the greater omentum were demonstrated by exploratory laparotomy. After euthanasia, a necropsy was performed and histological sections of representative issue samples were prepared. PCR followed by sequencing was conducted with DNA extracted from issue samples of the liver, hepatic lymph nodes and greater omentum. The sequence herein obtained showed very high similarity with other partial nad2 sequences of E. multilocularis from the GenBank database by BLASTn analysis and was analysed using the maximum likelihood method. The presented case combines the clinical presentation and pathological, parasitological and phylogenetic analyses.},

Two of the pups, which had the earliest onset of neurologic signs, were euthanatized without further workup. However, a detailed investigation was completed on the remaining two littermates at 12 weeks of age. Both pups had progressive paraparesis for 3 to 4 weeks before presentation, with one dog developing subsequent asymmetric pelvic limb extensor rigidity. Based on results from neurologic examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, electrophysiology, and muscle/nerve biopsy, a presumptive diagnosis of protozoal polyradiculitis and polymyositis was made. Necropsy of the most severely affected pup confirmed the clinical diagnosis of inflammatory nerve root and muscle disease but no organisms were found. To increase the potential yield of organisms, the second pup was placed on immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids and euthanatized 2 weeks later. Numerous organisms were found in lesions in muscle and the central nervous system. Organisms grew in tissue culture and were isolated from the peritoneal fluid of gerbils inoculated with infected tissue. Organisms were not isolated from inoculated mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and hamsters. No parasites were seen in feces or tissues of three cats fed infected dog tissues. Serologic testing demonstrated a strong positive titer to Neospora caninum in both pups, and electron microscopy showed the characteristic morphology of this parasite.},

	abstract = {Objective-To determine the effects of syringomyelia on electromyography (EMG) findings, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (TMMEPs) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs).
Animals-27 client-owned CKCSs that underwent prebreeding magnetic resonance imaging screening or investigation of clinical signs consistent with syringomyelia.
Procedures-In dogs with (n = 11) and without (16) magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed syringomyelia, the median nerve in each thoracic limb was stimulated and SEPs were recorded over the Cl vertebra; onset latency and latency and amplitude of the largest negative (N1) and positive (P1) peaks were measured. The TMMEPs were recorded bilaterally from the extensor carpi radialis and tibialis cranialis muscles; onset latencies in all 4 limbs were measured. Bilateral systematic needle EMG examination was performed on the cervical epaxial musculature, and the number of sites with spontaneous activity was recorded.
Results-In dogs with syringomyelia, amplitudes of Ni and P1 and the amplitude difference between P1 and Ni were significantly smaller than those recorded for dogs without syringomyelia (approx 2-fold difference). No difference in SEP latencies, TMMEP latencies, or the proportion of dogs with {\textgreater} 2 sites of spontaneous activity detected during EMG examination was detected between groups.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that SEP amplitude at the Cl vertebra was a more sensitive measure of spinal cord function in CKCSs with syringomyelia, compared with results of EMG or TMMEP assessment. Measurement of SEP amplitude may have use as an objective assessment of the evolution and treatment of this disease. (Am J Vet Res 2011;72:595-600)},

Biochemistry analysis revealed ionised hypocalcaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and severe hypovitaminosis D. Following diagnostic imaging, endoscopy and histological evaluation of intestinal biopsies, the dog was diagnosed with a PLE. Therapy included antibiotics, clopidogrel, hypoallergenic diet and immunosuppressive steroids, which resulted in the resolution of the diarrhoea and improved the hypocalcaemic and hypovitaminosis D abnormalities. Throughout the follow up period no more epileptic seizures were reported. The significance of this case is twofold.

METHODS: Blood samples obtained from 41 (CKCS) were analysed by impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation. Quantitative buffy coat analysis was performed only on 17 samples, selected from (CKCS) that had low platelet counts detected by cell counters. Platelet counts, platelet estimations and platelet parameters using these different methods were compared.
RESULTS: The median platelet number was lower when estimated using impedance cell counter (1363x10(9)/l) with respect to laser cell counter (1723x10(9)/l), microscopic estimation (2383x10(9)/l) or quantitative buffy coat analyser (2923x10(9)/l) (P {\textless} 0.01). Although impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation were positively correlated, there was no acceptable agreement among methods. (CKCS) with macrothrombocytes in blood smears had significantly lower counts on impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation. The percentages of (CKCS) with platelet count {\textless} 1003x10(9)/l were 34.1 per cent (impedance cell counter), 26.8 per cent (laser cell counter), 22.0 per cent (microscopic estimation) (not statistically different) and 5.8 per cent (quantitative buffy coat analyser) (P {\textless} 0.05).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: (CKCS) with macrothrombocytosis have low platelet counts on impedance cell counters, laser cell counters and microscopic estimation. (CKCS) with low platelet counts may have a normal platelet crit detected by a quantitative buffy coat analyser and thus a normal circulating platelet mass.},

	abstract = {Background: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) have a high prevalence of inherited macrothrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if a mutation in beta 1-tubulin correlated with presumptive inherited macrothrombocytopenia.
Hypothesis: A mutation in beta 1-tubulin results in synthesis of an altered beta 1-tubulin monomer. alpha-beta tubulin dimers within microtubule protofilaments are unstable, resulting in altered megakaryocyte proplatelet formation.
Animals: Blood samples were obtained from CKCS and non-CKCS dogs.
Methods: DNA was used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to evaluate beta 1-tubulin. Platelet numbers and mean platelet volume (MPV) were evaluated for a correlation with the presence or absence of a mutation identified in beta 1-tubulin. Platelets obtained from homozygous, heterozygous, and clear CKCS were further evaluated using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence.
Results: A mutation in the gene encoding beta 1-tubulin correlated with macrothrombocytopenia in CKCS. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies suggest that platelet microtubules are present but most likely are unstable and decreased in number.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The macrothrombocytopenia of CKCS correlated with a mutation in beta 1-tubulin. alpha-beta tubulin dimers within protofilaments most likely are unstable, leading to altered proplatelet formation by megakaryocytes. This information will aid in distinguishing inherited from acquired thrombocytopenia. It also provides insight into the mechanism of platelet production by megakaryocytes, and also may prove useful in understanding heart-related changes in macrothrombocytopenic CKCS with concurrent mitral valve regurgitation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine if there are differ ences in cellular changes in Cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) myxomatous mitral valves compared to non-CKCS dogs.
Animals: Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n = 6) and age-matched mixed breed (n = 6) with severe myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), and normal mixed breed (n = 4) dogs.
Materials and Methods: Immunohistochemistry staining and qualitative and quantitative analysis of mitral valves sections, examining for the presence of CD11c and CD45, vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and embryonic smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (Smemb), von Willebrand factor and CD31 and Ki-67.
Results: Vimentin positive cell numbers were increased in the MMVD dogs and distributed throughout the valve with greatest density close to the endothelium. There were no significant differences in cell marker expression for the two diseased groups, but cell numbers were significantly increased compared to controls for alpha-SMA (CKCS only) and Smemb (CKCS and mixed breed: p {\textless} 0.05). Alpha smooth muscle actin+ cells were primarily located at the valve edge, with Smemb+ cells similarly located, but also present throughout the valve stroma. A small number of cells close to the valve edge co-expressed alpha-SMA and Smemb. Endothelial von Willebrand factor expression was identified in all valves, with evidence of disrupted endothelium in the diseased, but was also found in diseased valve stroma. There was no staining for CD11c, CD45 or CD31 in any valve. Ki-67+ cells formed linear clusters at the leaflet tip and were sparsely distributed throughout both myxomatous valve groups.
Conclusions: The cellular changes notes with advanced stage MMVD appear similar for CKCS when compared to mixed breed dogs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To test the hypothesis that increased preload could hamper identification of low myocardial velocities in dogs with DCM and congestive heart failure the present study prospectively evaluated 32 English Cocker Spaniel dogs, being 16 with clinical DCM and 16 healthy for control purpose. The PTD analysis of regional velocities were performed in both longitudinal and radial myocardial displacements and systolic (Sm), early (Em) and late diastolic (Am) velocities were obtained in left ventricular free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Peak radial subendocardial and subepicardial Sm velocities were lower in DCM group compared to control (0.065 +/- 0.018 vs. 0.102 +/- 0.020m/s and 0.059 +/- 0.014 vs. 0.094 +/- 0.025m/s respectively; p{\textless}0.001). Peak longitudinal Sm velocities were lower in basal and medial portions of LVFW (0.093 +/- 0.034 vs. 0.155 +/- 0.034m/s and 0.091 +/- 0.033 vs. 0.134 +/- 0.037m/s respectively; p{\textless}0.001) and IVS (0.063 +/- 0.021 vs. 0.136 +/- 0.039 and 0.066 +/- 0.026 vs. 0.104 +/- 0.032m/s respectively; p{\textless}0.001). Most of diastolic velocities were not significantly different between groups, although advanced myocardial disease and dysfunction are expected in DCM group. Reduction in systolic basal and medial longitudinal myocardial velocities and in radial myocardial velocities was the most significant PTD findings. Increased preload did not represent a problem to evaluate systolic dysfunction by PTD in English Cocker Spaniels with DCM, but influence of preload on assessment of diastolic velocities should be better elucidated.},

	abstract = {Syringomyelia is a common clinical problem in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dog population. The underlying pathophysiology of the development and progression of syringes is currently unknown. The primary aim of the current study was to determine whether development of syringomyelia is accompanied by alterations in cerebrospinal fluid composition. Patient records of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like malformations, with or without concurrent syringomyelia, that had magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis between December 2004 and December 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. Total nucleated cell count per microliter, with differential count, red blood cell count per microliter, and protein concentration (g/l), were reviewed. Data were analyzed with the Mann Whitney U-test. Spearman rank test was used to test association between cerebrospinal fluid composition and syrinx size, and the Fisher exact test was used to compare the presence of macrophages, reactive lymphocytes, and myelin. A P value of {\textless}= 0.05 was considered significant for statistical tests. Dogs with syringomyelia had a higher total nucleated cell count (syringomyelia: 4/mu l [range, 0-15/mu l] vs. without syringomyelia: 2/mu l [0-8/mu l]; P = 0.0047), higher protein concentration (syringomyelia: 0.26 g/l [0.07-0.42 g/l] vs. without syringomyelia: 0.2 g/l [0.12-0.39 g/l]; P = 0.039), and an increased neutrophil percentage (syringomyelia: 0\% [0-37\%] vs. without syringomyelia: 0\% [0-21\%]; P = 0.0203) than those with the Chiari-like malformation alone. There was a positive correlation between total nucleated cell count and syrinx size (r = 0.51; P = 0.0068). Development of syringomyelia is accompanied by alterations in cerebrospinal fluid composition. The pathogenesis of syringomyelia has not been fully elucidated; therefore, the exact origin of cerebrospinal fluid changes remains unclear.},

The PACG in most of canine breeds is epidemiologically similar to humans with older and female patients overrepresented with the condition. The American Cocker Spaniel (ACS) is among the most common breeds observed with PACG development in dogs. This study initially sought to identify genetic risk factors to explain the high prevalence of PACG in ACSs by using a case-control breed-matched genome-wide association study. However, the GWAS failed to identify candidate loci associated with PACG in this breed. This study then assessed intrinsic ocular morphologic traits that may relate to PACG susceptibility in this breed. Normal ACSs without glaucoma have a crowded anterior ocular segment and narrow iridocorneal angle and ciliary cleft, which is consistent with anatomical risk factors identified in humans. The ACSs showed unique features consisting of posterior bowing of iris and longer iridolenticular contact, which mirrors reverse pupillary block and pigment dispersion syndrome in humans. The ACS could hold potential to serve as an animal model of naturally occurring PACG in humans.},

	abstract = {Objective-To study the relationship between parental cardiac status in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and development of chronic valvular disease (CVD) in offspring.
Design-Historical cohort.
Animals-54 female and 53 male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel offspring.
Procedure-7 sires, selected on the basis of their liability to develop CVD, were screened for clinical signs of CVD and assigned to 1 of 3 groups (late, intermediate, and early onset of CVD). The mates of these sires (30 dams) were selected and classified likewise, and 107 offspring produced in 1988 from matings between these parents were screened for clinical signs of CVD al a mean age of 5.3 +/- 0.3 years.
Results-55\% of the offspring were free from clinical signs of CVD, whereas 45\% had cardiac murmurs of low or moderate intensity, The proportion of offspring with heart murmurs and the intensity of murmurs were significantly greater with increased parental classification. More males than females had developed murmurs, and murmurs of moderate intensity also were more prevalent in males, Results of multiple-regression analysis indicated that mean parental classification and sex had significant effects on proportion of offspring with murmurs and their intensity. Additionally, age affected disease prevalence and severity, despite the narrow range in age of offspring examined.
Clinical Implications-Parental CVD status is an important factor influencing the probability of heart murmurs and their intensity in offspring. The results of this study indicate that CVD development is a polygenic threshold trait and that sex of the offspring influences threshold levels.},

Bone marrow evaluation of affected dogs revealed erythroid hyperplasia with normal or increased amounts of stainable iron, as would be expected in response to a haemolytic anaemia. Although the platelet count was not different from that of normal control dogs, the mean platelet volume was nearly 50\% higher in affected dogs. Absolute numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes were higher in affected dogs (10.7 +/- 1.3, 4.4 +/- 1.2 and 1.4 +/- 0.5 x 10(9)/l, respectively) than in normal control dogs (6.8 +/- 1.4, 3.0 +/- 0.3 and 0.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(9)/1, respectively).

The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical signs, metabolic changes and underlying genetic defect. Blood and urine organic acid analysis revealed increased medium-chain fatty acids and together with the clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 923 control genomes of different dog breeds. The ACADM gene encoding MCAD was considered the top functional candidate gene. The genetic analysis revealed a single homozygous private protein-changing variant in ACADM in the affected dog. This variant, XM\_038541645.1:c.444\_445delinsGTTAATTCTCAATATTGTCTAAGAATTATG, introduces a premature stop codon and is predicted to result in truncation of similar to 63\% of the wild type MCAD open reading frame, XP\_038397573.1:p.(Thr150Ilefs*6). Targeted genotyping of the variant in 162 additional CKCS revealed a variant allele frequency of 23.5\% and twelve additional homozygous mutant dogs. The acylcarnitine C8/C12 ratio was elevated similar to 43.3 fold in homozygous mutant dogs as compared to homozygous wild type dogs. Based on available clinical and biochemical data together with current knowledge in humans, we propose the ACADM frameshift variant as causative variant for the MCAD deficiency with likely contribution to the neurological phenotype in the index case. Testing the CKCS breeding population for the identified ACADM variant is recommended to prevent the unintentional breeding of dogs with MCAD deficiency. Further prospective studies are warranted to assess the clinical consequences of this enzyme defect.},

Recent research studies identified brachycephaly and reduced hind cranium as two conformational (dysmorphic) features that increase risk for symptomatic Chiari-like malformation and secondary syringomyelia (SM). A prospective pilot study investigated the hypothesis that dysmorphic head features could be assessed visually and correlated with risk of SM. Thirteen CKCS, selected from anonymised photographic evidence, were physically appraised by authorised Kennel Club judges using a head shape checklist. These subjective evaluations were then matched with objective measurements of the cranium (cephalic index and rostrocaudal doming) and their subsequent MRI. A positive correlation (P=0.039) between the judges' checklist score and rostrocaudal doming (hindskull ratio) and a positive correlation between the cephalic index and hindskull ratio (P=0.042) were identified. Five CKCS had no SM and their status tallied with 62 per cent of the judges' evaluation. Although the ability of adjudicators to identify differences in head conformation varied, there was sufficient association between the dysmorphic parameters and the risk of SM to cause concern and propose a larger study in CKCS breed.},

In comparison to dogs of other breeds (non-ESS) presenting for pacemaker implantation, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), the outcome and survival of ESS were investigated.
METHODS: Case records of dogs receiving pacemaker implantation were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Between September 2004 and October 2008, 58 dogs were presented to the Small Animal Teaching Hospital, University of Liverpool for pacemaker implantation. ESS (n=10) was the second most commonly presented breed. ESS were significantly younger than non-ESS (P=0.022). cTnI values were elevated on presentation and a significant reduction was present after pacemaker implantation (P=0.008) in all dogs. No significant difference in initial cTnI was identified comparing ESS and non-ESS (P=0.45) and median survival times were similar (P=0.37).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: ESS may be predisposed to bradyarrhythmias requiring pacemaker implantation. They present at a significantly younger age than non-ESS. Survival times between ESS and non-ESS were similar, despite ESS being paced at a younger age. However, pacemaker implantation is recommended in ESS as median survival times of 30 months with a good quality of life were achieved.},

Radiographic evaluation of the thorax and abdomen revealed enlarged cranial mediastinal and sublumbar lymph nodes. Tru-Cut biopsy from an enlarged lymph mode confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma, which was phenotyped as a B-cell tumour. The diagnosis in this case was systemic lupus erythematosus, with the unusual feature of pemphigus foliaceus, and subsequent development of B-cell lymphoma. The case adds further to knowledge of the protean clinical presentations of canine autoimmune diseases and provides additional evidence for the potential association between autoimmunity and immune-system neoplasia in this species.},

	abstract = {Background English springer spaniels (ESS) show an increased risk of chronic hepatitis (CH). In a previous study of 68 ESS with CH, in which only one dog received corticosteroids, a median survival time of 189 days was noted. Some ESS with CH appear to improve with prednisolone treatment; therefore, we aimed to investigate the response to prednisolone in this breed.
Participants ESS with histologically confirmed idiopathic CH were treated with prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day. Nine female and three male ESS were enrolled (median age at diagnosis of five years). Patients were monitored clinically and had biochemistry samples taken to assess markers of hepatocellular damage and function.
Results The mean starting dose of prednisolone was 1.1 mg/kg/day. All symptomatic patients showed an initial clinical improvement. Two cases were euthanased while receiving prednisolone. The median time since diagnosis is 1715 days (range: 672-2105 days) and the remaining patients are clinically well, with seven patients still receiving a mean dose of 0.4 mg/kg prednisolone every other day. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant (P{\textless}0.05) reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin following 2-4 weeks of prednisolone treatment.
Conclusion This study demonstrates improved clinical and biochemical parameters when some ESS with CH are managed with prednisolone and standard supportive treatments.},

A biochemically and clinically well characterized canine model of fucosidosis exists in a colony of English Springer Spaniels. To facilitate its use as a model for gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy in lysosomal storage disorders displaying neurological symptoms, isolation of the canine alpha-L-fucosidase cDNA was undertaken. Both the nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of canine fucosidase show high levels of identity with the human and rat sequences. Fucosidosis dogs were found to have a greatly reduced level of alpha-L-fucosidase mRNA when compared with normal dogs by Northern blot analysis. Direct PCR sequencing of products generated from cDNA demonstrated a 14-bp deletion in mRNA from affected dogs. This deletion creates a frameshift mutation and introduces a premature translation termination codon at amino acid position 152 and was shown to correspond to a deletion of the last 14 base pairs of exon 1 of the canine alpha-L-fucosidase gene. Rapid PCR-based screening for the mutation has now been performed on genomic DNA from dogs within the colony, enabling detection of both carriers and homozygotes.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common consequence of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) are frequently affected with MMVD and appear to have different disease progression compared to other dogs. This study aimed to determine if CKCS are more likely to develop PH as a result of MMVD than dogs of other breeds. A secondary aim was to explore whether breed or PH impacted survival.
Animals: A total of 187 dogs diagnosed with MMVD, 94 CKCS and 93 non-CKCS, were included in this study.
Methods: This is a retrospective review of dogs with MMVD. Data were analyzed for presence of PH, congestive heart failure (CHF) and echocardiographic variables including the ratio between mitral E wave velocity (E vel) and isovolumic relaxation time (E/IVRT) and were compared between CKCS/non-CKCS and dogs with/without PH. Survival analysis was also performed.
Results: American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage (p {\textless} 0.001), CKCS (p = 0.005), left atrium-to-aortic ratio (LA/Ao) (p {\textless} 0.001), E vel (p {\textless} 0.001) and log(10)(E/IVRT) (p {\textless} 0.001) were significant at the univariate level for PH development. At the multivariate level, only ACVIM stage remained significant (p = 0.044), suggesting that worsening MMVD was the predominant determinant of PH development in this study. Pulmonary hypertension was associated with greater likelihood of CHF (p {\textless} 0.001) and death (both cardiac [p {\textless} 0.001] and all-cause mortality [p = 0.011]). Cavalier King Charles spaniels were more likely to experience cardiac death than non-CKCS (p = 0.004).
Conclusions: In this study, development of PH was associated with worse MMVD, according to ACVIM stage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Animals-7 and 5 client-owned English Springer Spaniels (1 to 11 years old) with and without retinal dysplasia, respectively.
Procedures-Blood samples were obtained from affected and unaffected dogs via venipuncture. Genomic DNA was extracted from WBCs of the 7 affected and 5 unaffected dogs, and relative quantification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (COX1) was determined via analysis of real-time PCR results. White blood cells from 3 affected and 4 unaffected dogs were embedded in epoxide resin for TEM; cross sections were examined for lymphocytes, which were measured. The mitochondria within lymphocytes were quantified, and the mitochondrial surface area per lymphocyte cross section was calculated. A masked technique was used to compare mitochondrial morphology between the 2 groups.
Results-Compared with the smallest measured quantity of mtDNA among unaffected dogs, mtDNA amounts varied among unaffected (1.08- to 4.76-fold differences) and affected dogs (1- to 2.68-fold differences). Analysis of lymphocyte measurements and mitochondrial surface area, morphology, and quantity revealed no significant differences between affected and unaffected dogs.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-No significant differences were detected in relative amounts of WBC mtDNA or the size, number, or morphology of lymphocyte mitochondria in English Springer Spaniels affected with retinal dysplasia, compared with results for unaffected control dogs.

The slopes of latency-intensity functions from both groups did not differ, but the y-axis intercept when the x value was zero was greater in dogs with effusions (P = 0.009), consistent with conductive hearing loss.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To assess platelet closure time (CT), mean platelet component (MPC) concentration, and platelet component distribution width (PCDW) in dogs with subclinical chronic valvular heart disease.
ANIMALS
89 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and 39 control dogs (not CKCSs).
PROCEDURES
Platelet count, MPC concentration, PCDW, and Hct were measured by use of a hematology analyzer, and CT was measured by use of a platelet function analyzer. Murmur grade and echocardiographic variables (mitral valve regurgitant jet size relative to left atrial area, left atrial-to-aortic diameter ratio, and left ventricular internal dimensions) were recorded. Associations between explanatory variables (sex, age, murmur grade, echocardiographic variables, platelet count, and Hct) and outcomes (CT, MPC concentration, and PCDW) were examined by use of multivariate regression models.
RESULTS
A model with 5 variables best explained variation in CT (R-2, 0.74), with {\textgreater} 60\% of the variance of CT explained by mitral valve regurgitant jet size. The model of best fit to explain variation in MPC concentration included only platelet count (R-2, 0.24). The model of best fit to explain variation in PCDW included platelet count and sex (R-2, 0.25).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
In this study, a significant effect of mitral valve regurgitant jet size on CT was consistent with platelet dysfunction. However, platelet activation, as assessed on the basis of the MPC concentration and PCDW, was not a feature of subclinical chronic valvular heart disease in CKCSs. (Am J Vet Res 2016;77:860-868)},

The Advia 2120 reports a PCT, but the validity of this value has not been evaluated for dogs with macrothrombocytopenia. Objectives The goal of this study was to validate MPV and PCT determined by the Advia 2120 in dogs, including CKCS dogs, comparing values with those obtained from QBC analysis. Methods Advia PCT was compared with QBC results from 43 CKCS dogs and 15 dogs of other breeds in one study. Advia PCT, platelet count, and MPV were evaluated to identify biologic patterns in 31 clinically healthy CKCS dogs and 66 dogs of 3 other breeds and to generate values used for comparisons. Results Advia PCT agreed well with QBC results in general, but had a negative bias and appeared to underestimate PCT in CKCS dogs with the lowest PCTs. Advia PCT and MPV results followed expected biologic patterns in CKCS dogs and dogs of other breeds with MPVs being highest in dogs with the lowest platelet counts. Conclusions Advia 2120 PCT and MPV satisfactorily identified changes in platelet mass and size in CKCS dogs, but PCTs were lower than expected, especially in CKCS dogs with the lowest PCTs, when compared with QBC results.},

	abstract = {Background: Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia is a neurological disease complex with high prevalence in cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). The natural progression of this disease with time has not been described. The objectives of this study were to i) determine if syringomyelia progresses with time ii) determine if features of craniocrebral morphology previously associated with CM are progressive (including caudal cranial fossa volume, caudal cranial fossa parenchymal volume, ventricular dimensions, height of the foramen magnum and degree of cerebellar herniation). A retrospective morphometric analysis was undertaken in 12 CKCS with CM for which repeat magnetic resonance images were available without surgical intervention.
Results: The maximal syrinx width, height of the foramen magnum, length of cerebellar herniation and caudal cranial fossa volume increased over time. Ventricular and caudal fossa parenchymal volumes were not significantly different between scans.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that syringomyelia progresses with time. Increased caudal cranial fossa volume may be associated with active resorption of the supraoccipital bone, which has previously been found in histology specimens from adult CKCS. We hypothesise that active resorption of the supraoccipital bone occurs due to pressure from the cerebellum. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and variable natural clinical progression of CM and syringomyelia in CKCS.},

The condition affects more than 100 dog breeds and is known to be genetically heterogeneous between breeds. Around 19 mutations have now been identified that are associated with PRA in around 49 breeds, but for the majority of breeds the mutation(s) responsible have yet to be identified. Using genome-wide association with 22 Tibetan Spaniel PRA cases and 10 controls, we identified a novel PRA locus, PRA3, on CFA10 (p(raw) = 2.01 x 10(-5), p(genome) = 0.014), where a 3.8 Mb region was homozygous within 12 cases. Using targeted next generation sequencing, a short interspersed nuclear element insertion was identified near a splice acceptor site in an intron of a provocative gene, FAM161A. Analysis of mRNA from an affected dog revealed that the SINE causes exon skipping, resulting in a frame shift, leading to a downstream premature termination codon and possibly a truncated protein product. This mutation segregates with the disease in 22 out of 35 cases tested (63\%). Of the PRA controls, none are homozygous for the mutation, 15\% carry the mutation and 85\% are homozygous wildtype. This mutation was also identified in Tibetan Terriers, although our results indicate that PRA is genetically heterogeneous in both Tibetan Spaniels and Tibetan Terriers.},

Microscopically, the neoplastic cells were characterized by spindle to polyhedral phenotypes, having centrally located vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and melanin pigment accumulations in the cytoplasm. Neoplastic cells were seen within organ parenchyma as well as being found as emboli in blood and lymph vessels of those organs.

	abstract = {Background: Multiple advanced resting ECG (A-ECG) techniques have improved the diagnostic or prognostic value of ECG in detecting human cardiac diseases even before onset of clinical signs or changes in conventional ECG.
Objective: To determine which A-ECG parameters, derived from 12-lead A-ECG recordings, change with severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) in sinus rhythm.
Animals: Seventy-six privately owned CKCSs.
Methods: Dogs were prospectively divided into 5 groups according to the degree of MR (estimated by color Doppler mapping as the percentage of the left atrial area affected by the MR jet) and presence of clinical signs. High fidelity approximately 5-minute 12-lead ECG recordings were evaluated using custom software to calculate multiple conventional and A-ECG parameters.
Results: Nineteen of 76 ECG parameters were significantly different (P {\textless} .05) across the 5 dog groups. A 4-parameter model that incorporated results from 1 parameter of heart rate variability, 2 parameters of QT variability, and 1 parameter of QRS amplitude was identified that explained 82.4\% of the variance with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.60 (P {\textless} .01). When age or murmur grade was included in the statistical model the prediction value further increased the R to 0.74 and 0.85 (P {\textless} .01), respectively.
Conclusion: In CKCSs with sinus rhythm, 4 selected A-ECG parameters further improve prediction of MR jet severity beyond age and murmur grade, although the predictive increment in this study probably is not sufficient to warrant utilization in clinical veterinary practice.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability was measured in 81 Cavalier King Charles spaniels to investigate if it could be used to evaluate the severity of mitral regurgitation and to predict decompensation. Heart rate variability was assessed by the natural logarithm of the variance of the R-R intervals for 20 consecutive beats obtained from electrocardiographic recordings. Twenty-two of the dogs were clinically normal and 59 had mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease. The severity df mitral regurgitation was evaluated by echocardiography and thoracic radiography. Heart rate variability was found to be reduced (P {\textless} 0.001) among dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular dilatation and clinical signs of congestion. No significant differences in heart rate variability were found among normal dogs, dogs with only cardiac murmur, and dogs with echocardiographic evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and ventricular dilatation. Overall, an association was found between heart rate variability and left atrial to aortic root ratio and left ventricular end diastolic diameters (r = 0.72 and 0.64, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001), as well as heart and respiratory rate (r = 0.80 and 0.69, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). Multiregression analysis showed that, in order of importance, heart rate, left atrial diameter and respiratory rate had significant effects on heart rate variability. Among these parameters, heart rate variability and left atrial diameter were found to be most efficient in separating decompensated dogs from compensated. It is concluded that heart rate variability may provide the clinician with valuable information when assessing the severity of mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To investigate serum and plasma serotonin concentrations, percentage of serotonin-positive platelets, level of surface-bound platelet serotonin expression (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI]), and platelet activation (CD62 expression) in platelet-rich plasma from Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD).
ANIMALS
Healthy dogs (n = 15) and dogs with mild MMVD (18), moderate-severe MMVD (19), or severe MMVD with congestive heart failure (CHF; 10).
PROCEDURES
Blood samples were collected from each dog. Serum and plasma serotonin concentrations were measured with an ELISA, and surface-bound platelet serotonin expression and platelet activation were determined by flow cytometry.
RESULTS
Dogs with mild MMVD had higher median serum (746 ng/mL) and plasma (33.3 ng/mL) serotonin concentrations, compared with MMVD-affected dogs with CHF (388 ng/mL and 9.9 ng/mL, respectively), but no other group differences were found. Among disease groups, no differences in surface-bound serotonin expression or platelet activation were found. Thrombocytopenic dogs had lower serum serotonin concentration (482 ng/mL) than nonthrombocytopenic dogs (731 ng/mL). In 26 dogs, a flow cytometry scatterplot subpopulation (FSSP) of platelets was identified; dogs with an FSSP had a higher percentage of seroton-inpositive platelets (11.0\%), higher level of surface-bound serotonin expression (MFI, 32,068), and higher platelet activation (MFI, 2,363) than did dogs without an FSSP (5.7\%, 1,230, and 1,165, respectively). An FSSP was present in 93.8\% of thrombocytopenic dogs and in 29.5\% of nonthrombocytopenic dogs.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
A substantive influence of circulating serotonin on MMVD stages prior to CHF development in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels was not supported by the study findings. An FSSP of highly activated platelets with pronounced serotonin binding was strongly associated with thrombocytopenia but not MMVD.},

Data regarding the prevalence of the mutated allele are scarce in the global literature, and there is no study evaluating this frequency in Brazil. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the allele frequency of the c.5G{\textgreater}A mutation in the PRCD gene responsible for progressive retinal atrophy (prcd-PRA) in ECS dogs.
Abstract Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) due to the c.5G{\textgreater}A mutation in the progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD) gene is an important genetic disease in English cocker spaniel (ECS) dogs. Because the prevalence of this disease has not been verified in Brazil, this study aimed to evaluate the allele frequency of the c.5G{\textgreater}A mutation in the PRCD gene. Purified DNA from 220 ECS dogs was used for genotyping, of which 131 were registered from 18 different kennels and 89 were unregistered. A clinical eye examination was performed in 28 of the genotyped animals; 10 were homozygous mutants. DNA fragments containing the mutation region were amplified by PCR and subjected to direct genomic sequencing. The prcd-PRA allele frequency was 25.5\%. Among the registered dogs, the allele frequency was 14.9\%; among the dogs with no history of registration, the allele frequency was 41\%. Visual impairment was observed in 80\% (8/10) of the homozygous mutant animals that underwent clinical eye examination. The high mutation frequency found in this study emphasizes the importance of genotyping ECSs as an early diagnostic test, especially as part of an informed breeding program, to avoid clinical cases of PRA.},

	abstract = {Background
Few reported studies describe normal values from 24-hour ECG (Holter) recordings of small breed dogs.
Objectives
To investigate influence of breed, age, sex, body weight, degree of recording artifact, and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) on Holter recordings of 3 breeds of small dogs that have differing predispositions for myxomatous mitral valve disease. The study also assessed if heart rate (HR) at clinical examination (HRex) was associated with HR during Holter monitoring and evaluated the reproducibility of Holter variables.
Animals
Fifty clinically healthy, privately owned dogs of the breeds Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS), Wire-haired Dachshund (wD), or Cairn Terrier (CT).
Methods
Prospective, longitudinal observational study. Dogs were recruited for clinical examination, echocardiography, and Holter monitoring. In 8 CKCS, Holter recordings were performed twice with a 7-day interval. Arrhythmia and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis (time and frequency domain analysis) were performed on Holter recordings.
Results
Fifteen out of 27 Holter derived variables were significantly associated with breed (P {\textless} .03), but not with age (P {\textgreater} .7), sex (P {\textgreater} .2), body weight (P {\textgreater} .7), degree of recording artifact (P {\textgreater} .4), or MVP (P {\textgreater} .6). During Holter recording, minimum (P = .0001) and mean HR (P = .0001) were higher in CKCS compared with wD. CKCS had significantly lower values than wD, CT, or both in 10 out of 13 HRV variables (P {\textless} .03). Minimum and mean HR during Holter recording were correlated with HRex (r = 0.55, P = .0003). HR and time domain variables had a coefficient of variation {\textless} 10\%.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance
There is an influence of breed on Holter-derived variables in 3 breeds of small dogs. Arrhythmia and HRV analysis can be performed on 24-hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) recordings. Arrhythmia analysis includes HR measurements and identification of arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {Clinical studies have shown that Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) have a high prevalence of mitral valvular insufficiency (MVI). Echocardiography has the potential to disclose early valvular changes, and the present prospective study was designed to investigate the occurrence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in young CKCS without heart murmurs, and to correlate the degree of MVP with the clinical status of the dogs by including CKCS with MVI as well. The study was based on blinded evaluations of echocardiographic recordings of mitral valves from 34 CKCS and 30 control dogs. Thirteen (87\%) of 15 three-year-old CKCS without heart murmurs had MVP (2 total and 11 partial), as compared with 1 (7\%) of 15 three-year-old normal Beagle dogs (P {\textless} 0.0001), and none of 15 three-year-old normal Medium Size poodles (P {\textless} 0.0001). Of 19 CKCS with MVI, MVP was found in 84\% of the entire group and in 100\% of dogs with pulmonary congestion or edema. The occurrence of total MVP tended to be higher in the group with MVI (47\%, 9/19), when compared with the younger CKCS without heart murmurs (13\%, 2/15, P = 0.06), MVP was positively associated with excessive heart rate variability (P = 0.003). The radius of curvature of the anterior mitral valve leaflet in systole was significantly reduced in dogs with MVP when compared with those without (P {\textless} 0.0001). In conclusion, this study shows that CKCS at an early age have a high occurrence of MVP. This suggests: 1) A genetic predisposition of CKCS to MVP; and 2) That MVP is a pathogenetic factor in the development of mitral valvular insufficiency. Follow up studies may add further support to these proposals, and clarify whether echocardiography may be an aid in selecting CKCS for future breeding.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the pathogenesis of the chiari-like malformation in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is incomplete, and current hypotheses do not fully explain the development of syringomyelia (SM) in the spinal cords of affected dogs. This study investigates an unconventional pathogenetic theory for the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure waves in the subarachnoid space in CKCS with SM, by analogy with human diseases. In children with achondroplasia the shortening of the skull base can lead to a narrowing of the jugular foramina (JF) between the cranial base synchondroses. This in turn has been reported to cause a congestion of the major venous outflow tracts of the skull and consequently to an increase in the intracranial pressure (ICP). Amongst brachycephalic dog breeds the CKCS has been identified as having an extremely short and wide braincase. A stenosis of the JF and a consequential vascular compromise in this opening could contribute to venous hypertension, raising ICP and causing CSF jets in the spinal subarachnoid space of the CKCS. In this study, JF volumes in CKCSs with and without SM were compared to assess a possible role of this pathologic mechanism in the development of SM in this breed.
Results: Computed tomography (CT) scans of 40 CKCSs {\textgreater} 4 years of age were used to create three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and the JF. Weight matched groups (7-10 kg) of 20 CKCSs with SM and 20 CKCSs without SM were compared. CKCSs without SM presented significantly larger JF volumes (median left JF: 0.0633 cm(3); median right JF: 0.0703 cm(3); p {\textless} 0.0001) when compared with CKCSs with SM (median left JF: 0.0382 cm(3); median right JF: 0.0434 cm(3); p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the left and right JF within each group. Bland-Altman analysis revealed excellent reproducibility of all volume measurements.
Conclusion: A stenosis of the JF and consecutive venous congestion may explain the aetiology of CSF pressure waves in the subarachnoid space, independent of cerebellar herniation, as an additional pathogenetic factor for the development of SM in this breed.},

	abstract = {In young Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS), intermittent mitral regurgitation (iMR; defined as moderate to severe mitral regurgitation [MR] in a small proportion of heartbeats), has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac death due to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). It is associated with increased R-R interval variability. Little is known about response to physiological factors and whether iMR is a precursor for developing significant MR. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate, and short-term (1-2 year) progression of MR in CKCS with and without iMR. In total, 52 CKCS were included. Substudy 1 enrolled six dogs with iMR and 11 dogs without iMR. Substudy 2 enrolled 14 dogs with iMR and 28 dogs without iMR. Substudy 1 prospectively assessed the influence of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate. Substudy 2 retrospectively evaluated short-term progression of iMR.
During stress testing, iMR disappeared in 50\% of CKCS and no iMR was recorded at mean heart rates {\textgreater}150 beats/min. Heart rate response did not differ between CKCS with or without iMR. CKCS with iMR did not have a higher odds (odds ratio = 5.2; 95\% confidence interval, 0.7-38.2) of MR progression compared to controls (P= 0.1). In conclusion, physical stress influenced the occurrence of iMR in CKCS, but heart rate response was not different from CKCS without iMR. Intermittent mitral regurgitation did not significantly predict short-term MR progression. In stressed CKCS with early disease, iMR may be overlooked. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Hereditary retinal degeneration, often called progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), is prevalent in dogs with disease entities comparable to human retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). Recent molecular studies in the English Springer Spaniel (ESS) dog have shown that PRA cases are often homozygous for a mutation in the RPGRIP1 gene, the defect also causing human RP, LCA, and cone rod dystrophies. The present study characterizes the disease in a group of affected ESS in USA, using clinical, functional, and morphological studies. An objective evaluation of retinal function using electroretinography (ERG) is further performed in a masked fashion in a group of American ESS dogs, with the examiner masked to the genetic status of the dogs. Only 4 of 6 homozygous animals showed clinical signs of disease, emphasizing the need and importance for more precise studies on the clinical expression of molecular defects before utilizing animal models for translational research, such as when using stem cells for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Cardiovascular disease is associated with endothelial dysfunction in humans and studies of plasma biomarkers suggest that dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) might also have endothelial dysfunction.
Hypothesis: That progression of mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with development of endothelial dysfunction.
Animals: Forty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with MR of varying severity.
Methods: Privately owned CKCS were prospectively recruited and divided in 4 groups: (1) 12 CKCS with minimal MR; (2) 9 CKCS with mild MR; (3) 11 CKCS with moderate-severe MR; and (4) 11 CKCS with moderate-severe MR and clinical signs compatible with heart failure. Dogs underwent blood sampling, echocardiography, blood pressure (BP) recordings, and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) measurements. The effect of progressive MR on FMD was determined by multivariate analyses.
Results: Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased with progression of MR. Group 4 (4.79 +/- 3.22\%) had significantly lower FMD than groups 1 (10.40 +/- 4.58\%) and 2 (10.14 +/- 3.67\%) (P {\textless} .005) and group 3 (6.79 +/- 3.98\%) had a significantly lower FMD than group 1 (P = .03). Increasing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P = .0004, R-2 = 0.27) and the combination of age (P = .01) and body weight (P = .002) (R-2 = 0.31) were significantly associated with reduced FMD. FMD did not correlate with sex, BP, or plasma markers.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Reduced FMD indicates that increased disease severity in CKCS with MMVD is associated with development of endothelial dysfunction which might be a future therapeutic and/or diagnostic target.},

	abstract = {BackgroundModels for the regulation of thrombopoiesis predict that platelet mass is the biologically regulated variable, yet clinical evaluations of thrombopoiesis are often based on platelet number. When thrombocytopenia and variation in platelet size occur concurrently, platelet count may poorly estimate total platelet mass, confounding clinical decision making.
ObjectiveWe hypothesized that plateletcrit (PCT) provides clinically important information when platelet number is an incomplete representation of platelet mass, such as in genetic macrothrombocytopenia.
MethodsWe retrospectively compared platelet count and PCTs with general reference intervals for 4 groups of dogs: sick Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) and Greyhounds, presented for nonhematopoietic disease to the University of Minnesota (measured using an Advia 2120) and Auburn University Teaching Hospitals (measured using an Advia 120) over a 3-year period.
ResultsA canine PCT reference interval of 0.129-0.403\% was established. None of the 4 sample groups had significantly more individuals below the reference interval for plateletcrit. For platelet count, only the 2 CKCS groups had significantly more individuals below the reference interval than predicted.
ConclusionUse of the PCT as determined by the Advia 120/2120 appeared to avoid overestimation of low platelet mass in sick CKCS in a clinical setting. In contrast, the PCT performed similarly to the platelet count in evaluation of platelet mass in sick Greyhounds. Evaluation of the PCT should be considered in other conditions associated with increased mean platelet volume.},

Given that STMN1 affects fear behavior, we hypothesized that genetic variations in the STMN1 transcriptional regulatory region affect gene transcription activity and control fear behavior. In this study, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), g.-327A {\textgreater} Gand g.-125C {\textgreater} T, were identified in 317 English Springer Spaniels. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that both were loci located in the canine STMN1 putative promoter region and affected transcription factor binding. A statistical analysis revealed that the TT genotype at g.-125C {\textgreater} T produced a significantly greater fear level than that of the CC genotype (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, the H4H4 (GTGT) haplotype combination was significantly associated with canine fear behavior (P {\textless} 0.01). Using serially truncated constructs of the STMN1 promoters and the luciferase reporter, we found that a 395 bp (-312 nt to + 83 nt) fragment constituted the core promoter region. The luciferase assay also revealed that the H4 (GT) haplotype promoter had higher activity than that of other haplotypes. Overall, our results suggest that the two SNPs in the canine STMN1 promoter region could affect canine fear behavior by altering STMN1 transcriptional activity.},

Animals-76 clinically healthy CKCSs and 24 control dogs.
Procedure-All dogs underwent echocardiographic examination;, various hemostatic, hematologic, and biochemical variables were evaluated in blood. The CKCSs were allocated to 1 of 3 groups on the basis of MR severity. In 8 control dogs and 8 CKCSs, plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimer analysis was performed.
Results Compared with control dogs, plasma fibrinogen concentration was higher in all CKCSs and related to left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left atrial-to-aortic root ratio among all CKCSs. The activated partial thromboplastin times and plasma D-dinner concentration were similar among the 4 groups. Plasma vWF concentration was lower in CKCSs with moderate to severe MR, compared with that of CKCSs with no MR and control dogs. There was a relationship between plasma vWF concentration and platelet function in CKCSs but not in control dogs. In 4 CKCSs with moderate to severe MR and low plasma vWF concentration, amounts of vWF high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs) were low.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-In CKCSs, MR appeared to be associated with a low plasma vWF concentration and likely a loss of vWF HMWMs (possibly through their destruction via shear stress to the blood). The importance of the changes in plasma fibrinogen concentration and the thromboembolic risk in dogs with MR remain to be investigated.},

The dog was non-responsive to conservative medical therapy. A decompressive left-sided first-second caudal (Cd1-Cd2) foraminotomy was performed.
Postoperative computed tomography confirmed surgical decompression of the involved nerve root. At the one month follow-up examination there was marked improvement in clinical signs. At two months, clinical signs were completely resolved and there was not any evidence of recurrence twelve months after surgery.
Intervertebral disc disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with discomfort at the tail base or signs of pain on manipulation of the tail. Surgical decompression may be indicated for management of these cases.
This is the first report of diagnosis and surgical management of caudal intervertebral disc disease by foraminotomy in the dog. Surgical decompression by foraminotomy may therefore be a treatment option for this condition.},

PRA was suspected on ophthalmic examination before and after surgery, and/or after electroretinography (ERG) was performed. Visual outcome was assessed by menace response per eye at seven time periods post-surgery (P1= 25-90 days, P2 = 91-180 days, P3 = 181-364 days, P4 = 365-549 days, P5 = 550-729 days, P6 = 730-1094 days, and P7 {\textgreater}= 1095 days). Descriptive statistics were performed. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify predictors associated with vision after surgery. Odds ratio and confidence intervals were reported. Significance was set at P {\textless} 0.05. Owners were invited to participate in a questionnaire. Results Phacoemulsification was performed in 85 eyes. Median age at surgery was 9.09 years (min. 2.17 years, max. 13.49 years). At all re-examinations, up to and including P5, significantly more eyes were visual than before surgery (P {\textless}= 0.003). Odds for vision were significantly increased for eyes that underwent surgery. Electroretinograms were performed in 75/85 eyes that underwent surgery, demonstrating low b-wave amplitudes. There was no significant effect of the age, gender, vision before surgery, presence of dazzle reflex, cataract stage or abnormality on gonioscopy on visual outcome. The questionnaire response rate was 48.2\%. Most participants (92.5\%) felt that cataract surgery led to improvement of the dog's quality of life.

	abstract = {Higher concentrations of circulating serotonin have been reported in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) compared to other dog breeds. The CKCS is also a breed highly predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The aim of this study was to determine urine concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the major metabolite and excretion product of serotonin, in a population of CKCS with preclinical MMVD, and to evaluate whether urine 5-HIAA concentrations were associated with MMVD severity, dog characteristics, setting for urine sampling, platelet count, and serotonin concentration in serum and platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The study population consisted of 40 privately-owned CKCS (23 females; 17 males) with and without preclinical MMVD as follows: American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) group A (n =11), ACVIM group B1 (n = 21) and ACVIM group B2 (n = 8).
Urine 5-HIAA concentrations were not significantly associated with preclinical MMVD disease, platelet count or circulating concentrations of serotonin (in serum and PPP; P{\textgreater} 0.05). Females had higher 5-HIAA concentrations than males in morning urine collected at home (females, 3.1 [2.9-3.7] mu mol/mmol creatinine [median and quartiles]; males, 1.7 [1.2-2.2] creatinine; P= 0.0002) and urine collected at the clinic (females, 3.5 [3.1-3.9] mu mol/mmol creatinine; males, 1.6 [1.3-2.1] mu mol/mmol creatinine; P {\textless} 0.0001). Five-HIAA concentrations in urine collected at home and at the clinic were significantly associated (P= 0.0004; r= 0.73), and higher concentrations were found in urine collected at the clinic (P= 0.013). Urine 5-HIAA concentration was influenced by sex and setting of urine sampling. Urine 5-HIAA concentration was not associated with MMVD severity or circulating concentrations of serotonin in CKCS with preclinical disease. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Methods: Two reviewers retrospectively analyzed midsagittal T1WSE and T2WSE MR images and midsagittal preand postcontrast 2D multiplanar reformatted CT images from each dog for the presence of CH. And, if present, the length ( mm, CHL) of the herniation was measured. The results were analyzed statistically. Results: There was no significant difference between the different observers and techniques for the detection of CH and measurement of CHL. Overall, the CHL was longer on the CT images. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Both techniques are useful for detecting CH and measuring CHL. Because CHL does not have a known direct impact on the clinical presentation of CM, CT can be used as a diagnostic tool in a routine clinical practice for CM in CKCS when MRI is not available. We emphasize that MRI is the standard screening technique in CKCS for breeding purposes to detect the presence of CM and SM and, at the current time, CT cannot replace MRI.},

AnimalsA total of 8,860 CKCSs were examined at shows or private clinics from 1991 to 2010.
ObjectivesTo analyze the effects of a breed scheme for CKCS on the age at which a murmur consistent with DMVD was first detected.
MethodsThe presence or absence of a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation was noted and age a murmur was first detected recorded.
ResultsA total of 16,887 examinations were performed on 8,860 dogs. The median age dogs developed a murmur were slightly younger in male than female dogs (7.8 versus 8.3 years, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 7.4-8.1 versus 8.0-8.4, P {\textless} .001) and cardiologists detected murmurs in younger dogs than did general practitioner (GP) veterinary surgeons (7.2 versus 8.6 years, 95\% CI 7.0-7.4 versus 8.3-8.7 P {\textless} .001). In bitches examined by GP vets during the study, there was a significantly increased age of detection of murmurs over time (8.6-9.2 years, 95\% CI 8.3-9.1 and 8.5-10.9, P = .001) but not for male dogs examined by GP vets or dogs of either sex examined by cardiologists.
Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceThis study suggests that the age incidence of murmurs associated with DMVD might be increased by application of breeding guidelines based on auscultation alone. This benefit was only seen in a subgroup and compliance of breeders with this voluntary scheme was poor.},

	abstract = {Objective - To evaluate long-term success of cranial cervical decompression for management of canine Chiari-like malformation with syringomyelia (CM/SM).
Study Design - Retrospective clinical study.
Animals - Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n = 15).
Methods - After diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dogs had cranial cervical decompression with durotomy. Seven dogs had the durotomy patched with biocompatible collagen matrix. Clinical outcome was monitored for {\textgreater} 12 months.
Results - All dogs either improved (80\%) or were unchanged (20\%) postoperatively. Postoperative MRI in 6 dogs revealed persistence of syringomyelia. Seven dogs (47\%) subsequently deteriorated, 0.2-2.3 years after surgery (mean, 1.3 years) and 2 dogs were eventually euthanatized as a consequence. Twelve dogs were still alive, 1-6.5 years after surgery (mean, 2.5 years).
Conclusion - Cranial cervical decompression surgery is associated with low mortality and morbidity, and results in clinical improvement in most dogs. The procedure seemingly does not result in syrinx collapse and resolution. Clinical improvement may not be sustained and some dogs can be expected to deteriorate.
Clinical Relevance - Cranial cervical decompression surgery may have a role in management of CM/SM. In dogs with severe pain, it can improve quality of life for several years; however, it does not appear to adequately address the primary cause of syringomyelia. Further prospective study is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder. Because this condition causes neuropathic pain but does not necessarily result in euthanasia more information is needed on appropriate pain management for these patients.

Objective To evaluate the ability of ECS with RPED to absorb orally administered vitamin E and establish a basis for vitamin E supplementation in affected dogs. Animals studied 8 RPED-affected ECS and five clinically normal dogs. Procedures An oral vitamin E tolerance test (OVETT) was conducted in each dog. Blood samples were obtained prior to and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 120, and 240 h following oral administration of 90 iu/kg of RRR-a-tocopherol. Plasma alpha tocopherol (aTOC) content was measured by normal phase, high-performance liquid chromatography, and indices of vitamin E absorption calculated. Results There was marked variation in OVETT results between individuals. In RPED-affected ECS, mean peak plasma aTOC concentration (17.87 +/- 13.21 mu g/mL), attained after administration of a large oral dose of the vitamin, was significantly lower than the mean peak plasma aTOC concentration attained in normal dogs (47.61 +/- 17.17 mu g/mL; P {\textless} 0.005). However, the plasma concentrations achieved in 7/8 RPED-affected dogs remained within the normal reference range for plasma aTOC in vitamin E-replete dogs, for at least 12 h postdose. Conclusions Vitamin Edeficient ECS with RPED are capable of absorbing orally administered vitamin E. Twice daily administration of 600900 iu tocopherol is likely to restore plasma vitamin E concentrations to the normal range in most affected dogs.},

Animals studied A total of 45 eyes, 32 normal and 13 glaucomatous eyes, of American Cocker Spaniels with primary glaucoma were used. All eyes were evaluated through a complete neuro-ophthalmic examination, tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy prior to enucleation.
Methods The retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was measured in anesthetized animals with scanning laser polarimetry (Nerve fiber analyzer, GDx; Laser Diagnostic Technologies, LTD, San Diego, CA, USA). Glaucomatous eyes retained some vision at the time of this study.
Results The mean +/- SD of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 141.69 +/- 18 mu m for normal dogs and 105.08 +/- 23.86 mu m for visual glaucomatous dogs. The average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the superior and inferior retinal quadrants was 148.03 +/- 8.5 and 141.06 +/- 8.73 mu m, respectively, for normal dogs, and 106.61 +/- 25.77 and 107.08 +/- 24.99 mu m in the superior and inferior retinal quadrants, respectively, for glaucomatous dogs. The superior to nasal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ratio was 1.45 for normal dogs and 1.26 for visual glaucomatous dogs.
Conclusions Using scanning laser polarimetry it was possible to detect changes in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in glaucomatous dogs at early stages of the disease. Therefore, this instrument has the potential to improve the clinical management of canine glaucoma by detecting progressive changes to the retinal nerve fiber layer.},

Objectives Morphometric analysis of facial anatomy and dysmorphia in CM-associated pain (CM-P) and syringomyelia (SM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). Animals Sixty-six client-owned CKCS. Methods Retrospective study of anonymized T2W sagittal magnetic resonance imaging of 3 clinical groups: (1) 11 without central canal dilation (ccd) or SM (CM-N), (2) 15 with CM-P with no SM or {\textless}2 mm ccd (CM-P), and (3) 40 with syrinx width {\textgreater}= 4 mm (SM-S). Morphometric analysis assessed rostral skull flattening and position of the hard and soft palate relative to the cranial base in each clinical group and compared CKCS with and without SM-S. Results Sixteen of 28 measured variables were associated to SM-S compared to CM-N and CM-P. Of these 6 were common to both groups. Predictive variables determined by discriminant analysis were (1) the ratio of cranial height with cranial length (P {\textless} .001 between SM-S and CM-N) and (2) the distance between the cerebrum and the frontal bone (P {\textless} .001 between SM-S and CM-P). CM-P had the lowest mean height of the maxillary area. Conclusions and Clinical Importance CKCS with CM-P and SM-S have cranial brachycephaly with osseous insufficiency in the skull with rostral flattening and increased proximity of the hard and soft palate to the cranial base. Changes are greatest with CM-P. These findings have relevance for understanding disease pathogenesis and for selection of head conformation for breeding purposes.},

	abstract = {Hereditary myopathies are well documented in dogs, whereas hereditary dyserythropoietic anemias are rarely seen. The aim of this study was to further characterize the clinical and clinicopathological features of and to identify the causative genetic variant for a dyserythropoietic anemia and myopathy syndrome (DAMS) in English springer spaniel dogs (ESSPs). Twenty-six ESSPs, including five dogs with DAMS and two puppies that died perinatally, were studied. Progressive weakness, muscle atrophy-particularly of the temporal and pelvic muscles-trismus, dysphagia, and regurgitation due to megaesophagus were observed at all ages. Affected dogs had a non-regenerative, microcytic hypochromic anemia with metarubricytosis, target cells, and acanthocytes. Marked erythroid hyperplasia and dyserythropoiesis with non-orderly maturation of erythrocytes and inappropriate microcytic metarubricytosis were present. Muscle biopsies showed centralized nuclei, central pallor, lipocyte infiltrates, and fibrosis, which was consistent with centronuclear myopathy. The genome sequencing of two affected dogs was compared to 782 genomes of different canine breeds. A homozygous frameshift single-base deletion in EHBP1L1 was identified; this gene was not previously associated with DAMS. Pedigree analysis confirmed that the affected ESSPs were related. Variant genotyping showed appropriate complete segregation in the family, which was consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This study expands the known genotype-phenotype correlation of EHBP1L1 and the list of potential causative genes in dyserythropoietic anemias and myopathies in humans. EHBP1L1 deficiency was previously reported as perinatally lethal in humans and knockout mice. Our findings enable the genetic testing of ESSP dogs for early diagnosis and disease prevention through targeted breeding strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: Lumbar syringomyelia (SM), lumbosacral pain, and more caudal spinal cord termination are reported in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). Data are lacking on the clinical relevance of alterations in their spinal cord terminal structures.
Objectives: To compare spinal cord termination level and filum terminale internum length (FTIL) with presence of lumbar SM and clinical signs in CKCS.
Animals: Forty-eight CKCS.
Methods: In this prospective study, pain was quantified using owner and clinician assessments. Vertebral level of spinal cord and dural sac termination, presence of SM, and FTIL were determined from sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Kappa and intraclass correlation (ICC) analyses determined interobserver reliability. The MRI findings were compared to owner and clinician-reported pain quantification.
Results: Interobserver reliability was good for spinal cord and dural sac termination (kappa = 0.61 and 0.64, respectively) and excellent for FTIL (ICC: 92\% agreement). The spinal cord terminated at 6th lumbar vertebra in 1, 7th lumbar vertebra in 31, and the sacrum in 15 dogs, and termination level was associated with lumbar SM (P = .002) but not clinical signs. Mean FTIL was 2.9 +/- 1.08 mm; it was associated with owner-reported pain (P = .033) and spinal palpation scores (P = .023). Painful CKCS without SM had shorter FTIL compared to normal CKCS and painful CKCS with SM (P = .02).
Conclusions: Painful CKCS without SM have decreased distance between the termination of the spinal cord and dural sac, suggesting a shorter FTIL. More caudal spinal cord termination is associated with development of lumbar SM.},

Hypothesis/Objectives: To study the predictive value of selected clinical and echocardiographic characteristics associated with MMVD obtained at a young age for prediction of long-term cardiac and all-cause mortality in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS).
Animals: 1125 privately owned CKCS.
Methods: A retrospective study including CKCS examined at the age of 1-3 years. Long-term outcome was assessed by telephone interview with owners. The value of variables for predicting mortality was investigated by Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier analyses.
Results: Presence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.03, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.48-6.23, P = 0.0025) even intermittent moderate to severe MR (HR = 2.23, 95\% CI = 1.48-6.23, P = 0.039) on color flow Doppler echocardiography was significantly associated with increased hazard of cardiac death. An interaction between MR and sex was significant for all-cause mortality (P = 0.035), showing that males with moderate to severe MR had a higher all-cause mortality compared to males with no MR (HR = 2.38, 95\% CI = 1.27-4.49, P = 0.0071), whereas no difference was found between female MR groups. The risk of cardiac (HR = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.14-1.63, P {\textless} 0.001) and allcause (HR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.24, P = 0.016) mortality increased with increasing left ventricular end-systolic internal dimension normalized for body weight (LVIDSN).
Conclusions and clinical importance: Moderate to severe MR, even if intermittent, and increased LVIDSN in dogs {\textless}3 years of age were associated with cardiac death later in life in CKCS.},

Objectives: To use quantitative sensory testing (QST) to quantify thermal and mechanical thresholds in CKCS and to compare QST in dogs with and without syringomyelia (SM).
Animals: Forty-four CKCS.
Methods: Prospective study. Dogs underwent neurological examinations and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thermal testing was performed over the humerus and thorax (n = 32); mechanical testing was performed on the paw and neck (n = 44). Latencies, thresholds, and response rates were compared with presence and severity of SM on MRI, presence of pain reported by the owner and pain identified on examination.
Results: Thirty dogs had SM, 30 were painful on examination, 29 were owner-reported symptomatic. Thermal and mechanical variables were not significantly different based on presence or severity of SM. Dogs with pain on examination had decreased mechanical thresholds on the paw (0.38 kg, SD = 0.18) and neck (2.05 kg, SD = 0.74) compared to thresholds of dogs without pain on examination on the paw (0.60 kg, SD = 0.30) and neck (2.72 kg, SD = 0.57; P = .021).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Mechanical and thermal sensitivity does not appear to be related to the presence of SM, but mechanical sensitivity appears to be related to the presence of pain and clinical signs. Mechanical testing may be useful for assessing sensory abnormalities during clinical trials.},

The disease progresses faster in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs and occurs at an earlier age. QT interval length reflects abnormalities in ventricular repolarization which may predispose to the formation of fatal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. A fast and accurate assessment is therefore essential. The study aimed to examine the changes in QT duration in MMVD cases of CKCS and to calculate the corrected QT durations with Bazett's formula in various stages of the disease. The study included 20 CKCS dogs of both genders, various ages and weights, and different stages of MMVD (n=6 in B1 stage, n=6 in B2 stage, and n=8 in C stage), and 5 healthy CKCS which were included in the control group. Clinical, radiological, hematological, biochemical, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic examinations were performed. The corrected QT interval duration in the MMVD group was longer than the control (p {\textless} 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between B1, B2, and C.

Animals One hundred thirty client-owned Cavalier King Charles spaniels with neuroaxis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosis of CM-P/SM. Dogs with comorbidities causing similar signs were excluded with exception of otitis media with effusion (OME). Methods Retrospective study of medical records relating signalment, signs, and MRI findings. Dogs were grouped by SM maximum transverse diameter (1 = no SM; 2 = 0.5-1.99 mm; 3 = 2-3.9 mm: 4 = {\textgreater}= 4 mm). Differences between all groups-groups 1 versus 2-4 and groups 1-3 versus 4-were investigated. Continuous variables were analyzed using 2-sample t-tests and analysis of variance. Associations between categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact or chi-square tests. Results Common signs were vocalization (65.4\%), spinal pain (54.6\%), reduced activity (37.7\%), reduced stairs/jumping ability (35.4\%), touch aversion (30.0\%), altered emotional state (28.5\%), and sleep disturbance (22\%). Head scratching/rubbing (28.5\%) was inversely associated with syrinx size (P = .005), less common in group 4 (P = .003), and not associated with OME (P = .977). Phantom scratching, scoliosis, weakness, and postural deficits were only seen in group 4 (SM {\textgreater}= 4 mm; P = .004). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Signs of pain are common in CM/SM but are not SM-dependent, suggesting (not proving) CM-P causality. Wide ({\textgreater}= 4 mm) SM is associated with signs of myelopathy and, if the dorsal horn is involved, phantom scratching (ipsilateral) and torticollis (shoulder deviated ipsilateral; head tilt contralateral).},

A proposed aetiology of OME is inflammation of the middle ear mucosa, usually due to bacterial infection, leading to auditory tube dysfunction. Hypothesis/Objectives Our objective was to characterize the microbiological and cytological findings of otic exudates from the external ear canal (EEC) (n = 68) and middle ear (ME) (n = 69) from 41 CKCSs with PSOM. Methods and materials Swab samples from the EEC and mucus aspirated from the ME after performing a myringotomy were obtained for bacterial culture and cytological analysis. Results Fifty-five of 68 (81\%) EEC and 46 of 69 (67\%) ME yielded no bacterial growth. Thirty-eight of the 68 (56\%) ears had no microbial growth from neither the EEC nor ME; seven (10\%) had bacteria isolated from the EEC only; 17 (25\%) had bacteria isolated from the ME only, and six (8\%) had bacteria isolated from both EEC and ME. Thirty-four total bacterial isolates were cultured from ME. The most common bacterial species isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Otic cytology identified coccoid organisms in only three of 68 EEC and four of 69 ME. Conclusions The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of PSOM in CKCS is unclear. The majority of the EEC and ME of the CKCS with PSOM were negative by conventional bacterial culture and the cytological presence of bacteria was not correlated with culture positives. The potential role of noncultivable microbiota in PSOM requires exploration using molecular methods.},

Objective: To describe the position of the medulla at the CCJ in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS), and evaluate its relationship with clinical status and the presence of syringomyelia.
Animals: Thirty-six CKCS, 5-12 years of age, including 16 asymptomatic dogs.
Methods: Dogs were assigned a neurologic grade; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the CCJ then was performed. The presence of a CM and syringomyelia was recorded and syringomyelia severity was quantified. Medullary position was quantified using the medullary kinking index, the elevation angle and obex position relative to the foramen magnum. The relationship between medullary position measures and presence and severity of neurologic signs and syringomyelia was investigated.
Results: Chiari-like malformation was found in 33 dogs; 26 of them had syringomyelia. Mean medullary kinking index was 46.4\% (SD, 10.3), elevation angle was 132 degrees (SD, 12) and obex position was 3.5 mm (SD, 0.8). A higher medullary kinking index was associated with the presence of neurologic signs (P =.0368). Obex position was associated with the presence (P =.0018) and severity of syringomyelia (P =.0164).
Conclusions and clinical importance: There is a significant association between medullary elevation and clinical signs, whereas more caudal brainstem positions appear related to the presence of syringomyelia.},

	abstract = {BackgroundA 5-year-old, healthy English Springer Spaniel died suddenly 4months after delivering a litter of 7 puppies. Within 4months of the dam's death, 3 offspring also died suddenly.
HypothesisAbnormal cardiac repolarization, caused by an inherited long QT syndrome, is thought to be responsible for arrhythmias leading to sudden death in this family.
AnimalsFour remaining dogs from the affected litter and 11 related dogs.
MethodsPhysical examination and resting ECG were done on the littermates and 9 related dogs. Additional tests on some or all littermates included echocardiogram with Doppler, Holter monitoring, and routine serum biochemistry. Blood for DNA sequencing was obtained from all 15 dogs.
ResultsThree of 4 littermates examined, but no other dogs, had prolonged QT intervals with unique T-wave morphology. DNA sequencing of the KCNQ1 gene identified a heterozygous single base pair mutation, unique to these 3 dogs, which changes a conserved amino acid from threonine to lysine and is predicted to change protein structure.
Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceThis family represents the first documentation in dogs of spontaneous familial QT prolongation, which was associated with a KCNQ1 gene mutation and sudden death. Although the final rhythm could not be documented in these dogs, their phenotypic manifestations of QT interval prolongation and abnormal ECG restitution suggested increased risk for sudden arrhythmic death. The KCNQ1 gene mutation identified is speculated to impair the cardiac repolarizing current I-Ks,I- similar to KCNQ1 mutations causing long QT syndrome 1 in humans.},

Fourteen canines (four English springer spaniels and ten Labrador retrievers) were randomized into two groups: the control group received only placebo eye drops (carboxymethylcellulose), while the experimental group received carboxymethylcellulose eye drops containing 5 mu g of gintonin. Treatment was applied twice per day for a period of four weeks and STT-1, TBUT and TO were evaluated both prior to and following the treatment period; the latter using I-PEN (R) VET (I-MED Animal Health, QC, Canada). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate potential associations between baseline TO, STT-1 and TBUT values. Within-group statistical significance of value changes induced by treatment was determined using Student's t-test. Positive correlations exist between TO and STT-1 values, as well as between TO and TBUT values (P = 0.001 and P = 0.032, respectively). Gintonin treatment significantly increased only TBUT (21.0 +/- 11.2 s versus 7.5 +/- 2.8 s) and TO (317.1 +/- 18.1 mOsm/L versus 302.2 +/- 19.3 mOsm/L) values (P {\textless} 0.01 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). The results suggest that gintonin improves canine tear film quality, as indicated by increased TBUT and TO values.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0251071},
	abstract = {Purpose Three related male English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) were reported to be congenitally blind. Examination of one of these revealed complete retinal detachment. A presumptive diagnosis of retinal dysplasia (RD) was provided and pedigree analysis was suggestive of an X-linked mode of inheritance. We sought to investigate the genetic basis of RD in this family of ECS.
Methods Following whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the one remaining male RD-affected ECS, two distinct investigative approaches were employed: a candidate gene approach and a whole genome approach. In the candidate gene approach, COL9A2, COL9A3, NHEJ1, RS1 and NDP genes were investigated based on their known associations with RD and retinal detachment in dogs and humans. In the whole genome approach, affected WGS was compared with 814 unaffected canids to identify candidate variants, which were filtered based on appropriate segregation and predicted pathogenic effects followed by subsequent investigation of gene function. Candidate variants were tested for appropriate segregation in the ECS family and association with disease was assessed using samples from a total of 180 ECS.
Results The same variant in NDP (c.653\_654insC, p.Met114Hisfs*16) that was predicted to result in 15 aberrant amino acids before a premature stop in norrin protein, was identified independently by both approaches and was shown to segregate appropriately within the ECS family. Association of this variant with X-linked RD was significant (P = 0.0056).
Conclusions For the first time, we report a variant associated with canine X-linked RD. NDP variants are already known to cause X-linked RD, along with other abnormalities, in human Norrie disease. Thus, the dog may serve as a useful large animal model for research.},

	abstract = {BackgroundObjectivesMyxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is more prevalent in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) compared to dogs of other breeds at a given age. Abnormal valvular stress is thought to contribute to the development and progression of MMVD, and a relationship exists between mitral valve (MV) morphology and stress acting on the valve.
To determine whether the MV morphology of healthy adult CKCSs differs from the morphology of healthy adult dogs of other breeds determined by RT-3DTTE.
AnimalsMethodsThirty-five healthy CKCSs and 41 healthy dogs of other breeds.
Prospective cross-sectional study. Dogs underwent physical examination, conventional echocardiography, and RT-3DTTE. RT-3DTTE datasets were analyzed using dedicated software for MV morphologic analysis. Morphologic variables were compared between CKCSs and dogs of other breeds.
ResultsConclusions and Clinical ImportanceThe MV of healthy CKCSs had a smaller annulus height (0.46 0.11 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.17; P = .0021), tenting height (0.26 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.18; P {\textless} .001), tenting area (0.42 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.34; P {\textless} .001), normalized tenting volume (0.09 [0.05-0.13] vs. 0.14 [0.10-0.20]; P {\textless} .001), and normalized area of the posterior leaflet (0.57 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.18; P = .016) compared to healthy dogs of other breeds; this results in CKCSs having a flatter MV with reduced tenting, compared to the MV of other breeds.
These morphologic features could confer a mechanical disadvantage and play a role in the predisposition of CKCSs to the early development of MMVD.},

Hypothesis Neuropathic pain in CKCS is a result of a neuroinflammatory process. Animals Twenty-six client-owned dogs: 15 dogs with clinical signs of cervical hyperesthesia (group 1), and 11 dogs without of clinical signs (group 2). Methods Dogs were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and substance P were measured in CSF and compared with morphological findings on MRI and clinical pain scores. ResultsAll dogs without clinical signs had symmetrical syringomyelia, whereas in the group with pain, 6 dogs had symmetrical and 9 dogs had asymmetrical syringomyelia. Pain and syringomyelia asymmetry were correlated, and a strong association between pain and dorsal horn involvement of syringomyelia was observed. There was no significant difference between the mean width of the syringomyelia in dogs with or without pain. The concentrations of interleukin-6 and substance P were significantly higher in dogs with neuropathic pain. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was not detected in either group. Concentrations of substance P were significantly higher in dogs with asymmetrical syringomyelia or dorsal horn involvement, whereas interleukin-6 concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Conclusion Release of interleukin-6 and substance P may initiate proinflammatory effects leading to development of persistent pain in CKCSs with syringomyelia.},

Thirteen dogs reached the threshold of a total plasma Q10 concentration of {\textgreater}= 2.0 mu g/mL. The average half-life (T-1/2) of Q10 was 2.95 days (IQR, 1.75-4.02). No significant differences were observed in clinical MMVD severity, and the owner perceived QoL between Q10 and placebo treatment. The solubilized Q10 formulation was well-tolerated in the dogs. Individual variation in plasma concentrations was observed following oral treatment.

	abstract = {Background The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) affects valvular degeneration and dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) exhibit alterations in 5-HT signaling. In Maltese dogs, 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT transporter (SERT) gene are suggested to associate with MMVD. Hypothesis/Objectives Determine the association of SERT polymorphisms on MMVD severity and serum 5-HT concentration in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). Additionally, investigate the association between selected clinical and hematologic variables and serum 5-HT and assess the correlation between HPLC and ELISA measurements of serum 5-HT. Animals Seventy-one CKCS (42 females and 29 males; 7.8 [4.7;9.9] years (median [Q1;Q3])) in different MMVD stages. Methods This prospective study used TaqMan genotyping assays to assess SERT gene polymorphisms. Neurotransmitter concentrations were assessed by HPLC and ELISA. Results TaqMan analyses identified none of the selected SERT polymorphisms in any of the CKCS examined. Serum 5-HT was associated with platelet count (P {\textless} .001) but not MMVD severity, age or medical therapy and did not correlate with serum concentration of the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The ELISA serum 5-HT correlated with HPLC measurements (rho = .87; P {\textless} .0001) but was lower (mean difference = -22 ng/mL; P = .02) independent of serum 5-HT concentration (P = .2). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Selected SERT SNPs associated with MMVD in Maltese dogs were not found in CKCS and only platelet count influenced serum 5-HT concentration. These SNPs are unlikely to be associated with MMVD pathophysiology or serum 5-HT concentration in CKCS. HPLC and ELISA serum 5-HT demonstrated good correlation but ELISA systematically underestimated 5-HT.},

Previous research has suggested that selected candidate risk alleles for MMVD are fixed in CKCSs, including six locations within the Nebulette (NEBL) gene on CFA2. The current study analysed genotypes of 180 Australian CKCSs at the identified risk loci. Of these, 178 were phenotyped for severity of disease by echocardiographic measurements of left atrium to aortic root ratio (LA:Ao) and weight normalised left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVIDdN). Genotyping array markers correctly predicted the genotype at the risk-variant loci in the CKCS population, and the NEBL1, NEBL2 and NEBL3 variants were observed to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium in this cohort. The CKCS cohort included 6/178 dogs being heterozygous for the protective/wild-type alleles at the NEBL locus. The mean LA:Ao and LVIDdN scores of these dogs heterozygous at NEBL1-3 variants were significantly smaller, and with significantly lower variance compared to age-matched CKCSs that were homozygous for risk alleles. The lower cardiac measurements in the heterozygous dogs indicate a significantly reduced risk of severe MMVD disease. Our analysis suggests that despite relative fixation of the NEBL risk alleles, healthy reference alleles at NEBL1-3 exist in low frequency in the CKCS breed and can be used to reduce MMVD severity and mortality.},

This prospective cohort study followed 48 CKCSs with CM and/or SM and clinical signs suggestive of NeP for a period of 39 (+/- 14.3) months from diagnosis. At the end of the study, 36 dogs were still alive; five dogs died of an unrelated or unknown cause, and seven were euthanased due to severe clinical signs suggestive of NeP. During the follow-up period, the clinical signs of scratching, facial rubbing behaviour, vocalisation and exercise ability were evaluated. Nine out of 48 dogs stopped scratching (P{\textless}0.001), but there was no statistically significant change in the number of dogs exhibiting exercise intolerance, vocalisation or facial rubbing behaviour. The overall severity of clinical signs based on a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 mm: no clinical signs 100 mm: severe clinical signs) increased (from median 75 mm (interquartile ranges (IQR) 68-84) to 84 mm (IQR 71.5-91), P{\textless}0.001). A quarter of the dogs were static or improved. In general, the majority of the owners felt that the quality of life of their dogs was acceptable. Medical treatments received were gabapentin or pregabalin and/or intermittently, carprofen. The owner's perception of their animal's progress, and progress based on VAS, had strong positive correlation (Spearman's rank correlation (s(r)) 0.74, P{\textless}0.001). Overall, this study suggests that clinical signs suggestive of NeP progress in three-quarters of CKCSs with CM and/or SM.},

Hypotheses: (1) Holter-derived variables reflecting autonomic modulation of heart rhythm change with MMVD severity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS); (2) Holter-derived variables can identify MMVD severity in CKCS; and (3) Holter-derived variables in CKCS in congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to MMVD differ from those in dogs of other breeds in CHF.
Animals: Ninety privately owned dogs: 70 CKCS with variable MMVD severity and 20 non-CKCS in CHF secondary to MMVD.
Methods: Dogs were prospectively recruited and divided into 5 MMVD severity groups based on history, breed, and physical and echocardiographic examination findings. Holter-derived variables included heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR), and arrhythmia evaluated from 24-hour Holter recordings.
Results: In CKCS, 18 of 26 HRV (all P {\textless} .0002) and 3 of 9 arrhythmia (all P {\textless} .0004) variables decreased with increasing MMVD, whereas minimum and mean HR (all P {\textless} .0001) increased with increasing MMVD severity. An arrhythmia variable representing sinus arrhythmia ("premature normals") (P {\textless} .0001) and the HRV variable triangular index (TI) (P {\textless} .0001) could distinguish CKCS with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation from CKCS in CHF in specific intervals. Among dogs in CHF, Holter-derived variables did not differ among breeds.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: In CKCS, Holter-derived variables changed with MMVD severity. "Premature normals" and TI showed diagnostic potential. Breed differences were not seen among dogs in CHF secondary to MMVD.},

Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and heritability of symptomatic SM, the association between clinical signs and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) findings, and long- term outcome. Animals: All CKCS registered in the Danish Kennel Club in 2001 ( n = 240). Methods: A cross- sectional questionnaire- based prevalence study validated by telephone interviews and clinically investigated clinical signs of SM. Dogs were 6 years at the time of investigation. A prospective observational litter study including clinical investigations, MRI and 5- year follow- up of symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings. Heritability was estimated based on the scale of liability in the study population and litter cohort. Results: The cross- sectional study estimated a prevalence of symptomatic SM at 15.4\% in the population. Thirteen symptomatic and 9 asymptomatic siblings participated in the litter study. Spinal cord syringes were confirmed in 21 of 22 littermates ( 95\%). Syrinx diameter and mean syrinx : spinal cord ratio were significantly correlated with clinical signs ( P {\textless}.01). Estimated heritability of symptomatic SM was 0.81. Symptomatic SM motivated euthanasia in 20\%. Dogs with syringes, which expressed no clinical signs at the age of 6, remained asymptomatic in 14/ 15 cases ( 93\%). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The prevalence of symptomatic SM is high and genetics have a high impact on clinical disease expression.

This preliminary pilot study aimed to (1) describe the clinical and echocardiographic parameters of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease at different American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stages (B1, B2 and C) and healthy control group (ACVIM A), comparing the parameters collected during the first examination (T0) and the end of the follow-up (T1); (2) assess the association between the values of echocardiographic parameters at T1 and the expression profile of miR-30b-5p at T0. Thirty-five Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (median age 4.29 years and median weight 9 Kg) in different ACVIM stages were included (7 A, 19 B1, 6 B2 and 3 C). Inverse probability weighting analysis was performed to estimate the association of the exposure variable (miR-30b-5p) with the outcome variables (clinical and echocardiographic variables). Time was included as variable. The results pointed out that high levels of plasma miR-30b-5p corresponded to lower values of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter normalized for body weight, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexed for body weight, and left atrium-to aortic root ratio. Hence, higher miR-30b-5p expressions were associated with milder forms of mitral valve disease in our study population. In contrast, the results obtained for the intensity of heart murmur, the mitral regurgitation severity, and the Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic score) were not statistically significant. A relationship between high abundance of miR-30b-5p and myxomatous mitral valve disease that appear echocardiographically more stable over time has been demonstrated. In conclusion, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease that at the first cardiologic evaluation showed an upregulation of miR-30b-5p are expected to experience lesser variations on their echocardiographic examination between T0 and T1.},

	abstract = {Progesterone (P4) concentrations during canine pregnancy follow a specific pattern. Although the general pattern is similar, it is likely that breed-specific differences exist. Detailed knowledge about the physiological range of P4 concentrations may be helpful in cases of suspected hypoluteoidism. The aim of this study was to investigate P4 changes during pregnancy in a small and a large breed, to obtain reference values for specific intervals during pregnancy and to test for breed- or body weight-specific differences. We studied P4 concentrations in pregnancies from healthy Bernese mountain dogs (BMDs, n = 6) and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs, n = 6) with a normal reproductive history. Blood samples for P4 were taken to determine the day of ovulation and after confirmation of pregnancy in regular intervals from Days 23 to 29 to Days 60 to 64. Bernese mountain dogs delivered 6.2 +/- 2.6 puppies (range: 3-9) 63.4 +/- 1.5 (range: 61-65) days after ovulation (excluding data from one BMD with elective c-section) and CKCS delivered 3.3 +/- 1.9 puppies (range: 1-5) 63.5 +/- 1.1 (range: 62-65) days after ovulation. In general, the P4 concentrations of individual dogs continuously decreased from the first to the last sampling during pregnancy. Respective mean concentrations were Days 23 to 29: 192 +/- 4.3/22.2 +/- 3.9 ng/mL (BMD/CKCS), Days 30 to 34: 15.6 +/- 2.3/17.7 +/- 5.8 ng/mL, Days 35 to 39: 12.5 +/- 2.8/14.1 +/- 3.4 ng/mL, Days 40 to 44: 8.9 +/- 1.4/11.8 +/- 3.7 ng/mL, Days 45 to 49: 7.7 +/- 1.6/8.9 +/- 1.9 ng/mL, Days 50 to 54: 6.0 +/- 1.3/8.7 +/- 7.1 ng/mL, Days 55 to 59: 4.7 +/- 1.2/5.3 +/- 2.8 ng/mL, and Days 60 to 64: 3.69 +/- 1.86/2.62 +/- 0.42 ng/mL. ANOVA indicated significant differences over time within each breed when considered individually (P {\textless} 0.0001 each), but not between breeds although mean P4 was slightly lower in BMD until Days 55 to 59. The present data clearly confirm the previously described P4 pattern during canine pregnancy with highest P4 concentrations obtained in the first interval (Days 23-29) and a subsequent decrease of P4. The lack of a significant rapid prepartal P4 drop might be related to methodological issues (time of last collection in regards to parturition). Other than expected, we failed to proof significant differences in P4 between CKCS and BMD. Further studies are required to confirm the results on a larger population of both breeds, but also other large-sized breeds to test for the hypothesis if BMD might have lower P4 concentrations and smaller litter size compared to other large breeds with larger litter size.

It is particularly common in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) breed and affected dogs are frequently managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). We have previously identified a canine ACE gene polymorphism associated with a decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate for the prevalence of the ACE polymorphism in CKCS with mitral valve disease and to determine whether the presence of the polymorphism is associated with alterations in ACE activity at different stages of cardiac disease.MethodsSeventy-three dogs with a diagnosis of mitral valve disease were evaluated and a blood sample was drawn for ACE polymorphism genotyping and ACE activity measurement.ResultsForty-three dogs were homozygous for the ACE polymorphism; five were heterozygous and 25 were homozygous wild type. The mean age and the median severity of disease were not different for dogs with the polymorphism and dogs with the wild-type sequence. The median baseline ACE activity was significantly lower for the ACE polymorphism (27.0U/l) than the wild-type sequence dogs (31.0U/l) (P=0.02). Dogs with more severe disease and the ACE polymorphism had significantly lower levels of ACE activity than dogs with the wild-type sequence (P=0.03).ConclusionThe CKCS appears to have a high prevalence of the ACE variant. Dogs with the ACE variant had lower levels of ACE activity even in more advanced mitral valve disease than dogs without the variant. The clinical significance of this finding and its impact on the need for ACE-I in dogs with the polymorphism and heart disease deserves further study.},

Sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images have been described as the preferred technique for visualizing SMin dogs and humans. Objective: To investigate whether computed tomography (CT) can be used to diagnose SM. Animals: Thirty- two client- owned dogs referred for investigation of the cervical spine on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT. Methods: Two reviewers retrospectively analyzed sagittal and transverse T1- weighted spin echo (T1WSE) MR images and CT images from each dog for the presence of SM and, if SM was present, the width (mm, syrinx width [ SW]) was measured. The results were analyzed statistically. Results: For the presence of SM there was a moderate interobserver agreement for MR (81\%, j = 0.54) and almost perfect agreement for CT (94\%, j = 0.87). There was a moderate intramodality agreement for both observers (observer 1 81\%, j = 0.59; observer 2 81\%, j = 0.57). For measurement of SW the repeatability was the best on the midsagittal T1WSE images (95\% repeatability coefficient {\textless} 0.52 mm) and the reproducibility was the best on midsagittal images in both modalities (95\% limits of agreement 0.55- 0.45; P = 0.002). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Both techniques can be used to detect SM. Midsagittal MR and CT images are best used for measuring SW. Computed tomography can be used as a diagnostic tool for SM when MRI is not available, but CT cannot replace MRI as the standard screening technique for the detection of SM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel for breeding purposes.},

	abstract = {Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) are common illnesses that can cause debilitating neuropathic pain in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). The current imaging modality to screen CKCS for CM/SM is MRI of the brain and cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging provides good soft tissue detail and contrast of the cerebellum and cervical spinal cord. Computed tomography (CT) is another cross-sectional imaging technique that facilitates brain and neck evaluation; however, soft tissue resolution does not match that of MRI. Computed tomography benefits include identification of concurrent craniocervical junction anomalies (atlantooccipital overlap) and shorter imaging/anesthesia times with the ability to use only sedation. The aim of this retrospective, method comparison study is to assess the utility of multidetector CT for screening CM and SM in CKCS as compared to high-field MRI. Three groups of observers with different levels of experience graded CM and SM based on the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club CM/SM classification criteria. Thirty CKCS underwent multidetector CT and 3 Tesla MRI studies. Computed tomography and MRI studies were reviewed at different timepoints to minimize bias. Computed tomography has lower Cohen's Kappa agreement for each observer group compared to MRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient averaging CM and SM for all groups was excellent using MRI, while CT was poor for SM and moderate for cerebellar herniation. Greater observer experience resulted in a higher agreement for CT and MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging should remain the standard for screening of CM and SM as CT can result in misclassification and greater disagreement.},

ObjectiveTo evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of worsening clinical signs, syringomyelia, and morphology in CKCS longitudinally.
AnimalsFifty-four client-owned CKCS, 5-13 years old; 50\% currently symptomatic.
MethodsLongitudinal observational study. We enrolled CKCS with an MRI of the CCJ performed 3 years earlier. We used questionnaires and neurologic examinations to grade initial and current clinical status. Dogs that could be anesthetized were reimaged. Morphologic assessments included the presence and severity of: Chiari-like malformations, medullary position, atlantooccipital overlapping (AOO), dorsal atlantoaxial bands, and syringomyelia. Cranial cavity volumes and foramen magnum height were measured.
ResultsClinical status was evaluated in 54 dogs; 36/54 were reimaged. Mean follow-up was 71 months. Of initially asymptomatic dogs, 32\% were symptomatic at re-evaluation. Of initially symptomatic dogs, 56\% had worsened; 13\% had improved with medical management. The morphology of the CCJ at initial imaging did not predict development of either new or worsened signs or syringomyelia by the time of re-evaluation.
ConclusionCraniocervical junction anomalies assessed in this study did not appear predictive of future clinical status or syringomyelia in our cohort. The impacts of syringomyelia, AOO, and atlantoaxial bands on future clinical status merit further study in larger groups of CKCS. Clinical progression in our cohort of medically managed CKCS did not differ substantially from published reports of those treated surgically.},

This histopathological study used spinal cords from CKCS dogs with syringomyelia to investigate the following conditions: (1) whether specific structural cervical spinal cord entities involved in nociception were affected by loss of neuroparenchyma or other pathological changes in CKCS dogs with pain-related behaviour and phantom scratching, (2) whether pain-related behaviour or phantom scratching correlated with loss of a specific anatomical entity or upregulation of glia cells, and (3) whether syringomyelia-related lesions affected specific functional spinal cord units of nociception. Spinal cord segments C1-C8 from CKCS dogs with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed syringomyelia and clinical signs of pain and phantom scratching (n = 8) were compared with those from CKCS dogs without syringomyelia (n = 4). Dogs with unilateral scratching (n = 7) had a volume loss (P = 0.043) of the dorsal horn laminae I-III in the ipsilateral side compared with the contralateral dorsal horn. A clear pattern of ipsilateral changes in the dorsal root entry zone characterised by deafferentation and reorganization of first-order axons into deeper laminae was found in cases with lateralised scratching. Significant changes in cell number density were not found for astrocytes or microglia, suggesting that the dogs represented cases of end-stage syringomyelia and thus could not reveal astrogliosis and microgliosis, which may be involved in the early phases of syrinx development and phantom scratching. The present relationship between clinical findings and dorsal horn and pain pathway pathology in CKCS dogs suggests that these dogs may be of interest as a supplement to experimental model pain research.},

	abstract = {Canine Chiari-like malformation (CM) is characterised by herniation of part of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum. In humans with Chiari type I malformation (CM-I), abnormal pulsation of the cerebellum during the cardiac cycle has been documented and is pivotal to theories for the pathogenesis of syringomyelia (SM). In this retrospective study, cardiac-gated cine balanced fast field echo (bFEE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess pulsation of the brain in dogs and to objectively measure the degree of cerebellar pulsation with the neck in a flexed position. Overall, 17 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with CM, including eight with SM and nine without SM, were compared with six small breed control dogs. Linear regions of interest were generated for the length of cerebellar herniation from each phase of the cardiac cycle and the degree of cerebellar pulsation was subsequently calculated. Age, bodyweight and angle of neck flexion were also compared.
CKCS with CM and SM had significantly greater pulsation of the cerebellum than control dogs (P = 0.003) and CKCS with CM only (P = 0.031). There was no significant difference in age, bodyweight and angle of neck flexion between the three groups. Cardiac-gated cine bFEE MRI permitted the dynamic visualisation of cerebellar pulsation in dogs. These findings support the current theories regarding the pathogenesis of SM secondary to CM and further highlight the similarities between canine CM and human CM-I. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Animals - 65 CKCSs and 72 dogs of other breeds.
Procedures - The amount that the spinous process of the axis overlapped the dorsal arch of the atlas, the relative size of the spinous process of the axis, and the amount of widening of the atlantoaxial joint that occurred when the neck was moved from a neutral to a flexed position were measured on lateral radiographic projections of the atlantoaxial region. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed to identify CKCSs with syringomyelia.
Results - The amount of overlap of the atlas and axis and the relative size of the spinous process of the axis were significantly smaller in CKCSs than in dogs of other breeds. However, the amount of widening of the atlantoaxial joint that occurred when the neck was moved from a neutral to a flexed position was not significantly different between groups, and no association was detected between syringomyelia and excessive atlantoaxial joint space widening or between syringomyelia and an excessively small axial spinous process.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Results suggested that radiographic morphology of the atlantoaxial region in CKCSs differs from morphology of that region in dogs of other breeds, but that these differences do not account for why some CKCSs develop syringomyelia and others do not.},

Objective: Investigate the influence of AA bands on clinical status and syringomyelia (SM) in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS).
Animals: Thirty-six CKCS, 5-12 years of age, including 20 dogs with neuropathic pain.
Methods: Dogs were examined and assigned a neurologic grade. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the craniocervical junction was performed with the craniocervical junction extended and flexed (ie, normal standing position). Imaging studies were assessed for the presence of an AA band, CM, SM or some combination of these findings. Band and SM severity were quantified using an objective compression index and ordinal grading scale, respectively.
Results: Of 36 CKCS imaged, 34 had CM. Atlantoaxial bands were present in 31 dogs and were more prominent in extended than flexed positions. Syringomyelia was found in 26 dogs, 23 of which also had AA bands. Bands were associated with both the presence (P =.0031) and severity (P =.008) of clinical signs and SM (P =.0147, P =.0311, respectively). Higher compression indices were associated with more severe SM (P =.0137).
Conclusions: Prevalence of AA bands in older CKCS is high. Positioning of dogs in extension during MRI enhances the sensitivity of the study for detecting this important abnormality. There were significant associations among AA bands, clinical signs, and SM in dogs with CM; additional work is needed to understand whether or not this relationship is causal.},

	abstract = {Syringomyelia is a complex disorder of the spinal cord characterized by the presence of one or more fluid filled cavities within the spinal cord, which by compressing the adjacent nervous tissue leads to various clinical signs - neuropathic pain, sudden yelping, "phantom scratching", ataxia, vestibular dysfunction. The most common predisposing cause of syringomyelia in dogs is Chiari-like malformation, an anomaly characterized by a small posterior cranial fossa compared to the brain tissue, which often leads to herniation of the cerebellum, and sometimes also the brainstem, into or through the foramen magnum (cranial fossa communicates with the spinal canal through the foramen magnum). In this way, the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is disrupted, leading to secondary lesions and clinical symptomatology.
Chiari-like malformation represents a condition analogue to Arnold-Chiari malformation in humans.
Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia it is a common condition in dogs, especially in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs and brachycephalic toy breeds.
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed is a relatively new introduced in Romania, with a recently increase in popularity. Unfortunately, this breed has a high predisposition to develop Chiari-like malformation and Syringomyelia, a severe neurological condition, more frequent diagnosed lately, thanks to the new generation imaging instruments, such as computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia are a topic of real interest in canine neuropathology, being a subject of current research due to the fact that in the evolution of the disease are multiple unknowns, and due the fact that currently there is no effective treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Studies have indicated a strong genetic background.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a breeding scheme involving auscultation and echocardiography.
Animals: In the Danish Kennel Club mandatory breeding scheme, 997 purebred CKCS were examined during the period 2002-2011. Each dog was evaluated 1-4 times with a total of 1,380 examinations.
Methods: Auscultation and echocardiography were performed to evaluate mitral regurgitation murmur severity and degree of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The odds of having mitral regurgitation murmur or MVP {\textgreater} grade 1 in 2010-2011 compared to 2002-2003 were estimated using logistic regression analysis including age and sex as covariates. Odds were estimated for dogs that were products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with both parents approved by the breeding scheme before breeding) and non-products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with at least 1 parent with unknown cardiac status).
Results: In 2010-2011, the odds of having mitral regurgitation murmur were 0.27 if dogs were a product of the breeding scheme compared with dogs in 2002-2003, reflecting a 73\% decreased risk (P {\textless} .0001). If non-products of the breeding scheme examined in 2010-2011 were compared with dogs in 2002-2003, no difference in odds was found (P = .49).
Conclusion and Clinical Importance: A mandatory breeding scheme based on auscultation and echocardiography findings significantly decreased the prevalence of MMVD over the 8- to 10-year period. Such a breeding scheme therefore is recommended for CKCS.},

To determine breed-specific reference intervals for whole blood (WB) and plasma taurine concentrations in adult, overtly healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and determine whether taurine concentrations differ across preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) stages or between CKCSs eating diets that meet World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) nutritional guidelines versus other diets.
ANIMALS
200 privately owned CKCSs.
PROCEDURES
Clinically healthy adult CKCSs were recruited prospectively. Diet and supplement history was collected. Dogs were staged by echocardiography using MMVD consensus guidelines. Taurine concentrations were measured in deproteinized lithium heparin WB and plasma samples with the postcolumn ninhydrin derivatization method on a dedicated amino acid analyzer.
RESULTS
There were 12 stage A (6\%), 150 stage B1 (75\%), and 38 stage B2 (19\%) CKCSs. Seventy-eight dogs (39\%) were reported by their owners to be eating diets meeting WSAVA nutritional guidelines; 116 (58\%) were not. Taurine concentrations in plasma (P = .444) and WB (P = .073) were not significantly different across MMVD stages or between CKCSs eating diets meeting WSAVA nutritional guidelines versus other diets (P = .345 and P = .527, respectively). Reference intervals for WB taurine (152 to 373 mu M) and plasma taurine (51 to 217 mu M) concentrations in CKCSs were generated.},

The aims were to analyse the health and genetic variability of the population and to check whether the population falls within the standards for the breed from a morphological point of view. In addition, we studied the influence of F on phenotypic traits and on the occurrence of various genetic diseases (progressive retinal atrophy, familiar nephropathy, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation and the juvenile renal dysplasia). All data were collected in relation to 83 adult (mean age 4.42 +/- 2.528 years) dogs (20 males and 63 females) born in the period 2011-2018 and belonging to one Italian breeder. The F of each dog and other genealogical parameters were calculated. The prevalence of each highlighted disease within the population was performed. ANOVA was used to test the differences in F values among the animals subdivided into different groups (healthy and un-healthy dogs, coat colour, birth year and sex). Differences between sexes in morphological traits and proportions were also analysed showing sexual dimorphism. The predominant colours were Blue-Roan (30.12\%) and Red (26.51\%). We found an excellent health status and a good genetic variability of the analysed population. The only disorder that caused concern was juvenile renal dysplasia (26.51\%, 95\% CI 14.27-38.74\%). A relationship was suggested between inbreeding and the disorder as F was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.01) in sick (F = 0.068) than in healthy animals (F = 0.014).},

Study design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study.
Animals A total of 12 client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (age, 1.1-7.4 years, bodyweight, 8.2-10.8 kg) with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed SM and clinical signs of CNeP.
Methods Dogs were randomized to either PGN 150 mg or placebo for 25 days, followed by 48 hour washout period before crossover to the alternate phase of 25 days. The primary outcome was defined as number of scratching events during 10 minutes of video-recorded physical activity. Treatment effect was estimated using a generalized estimation equation model. Benefit-risk and quality of life assessments were obtained through owner interviews focusing on potential adverse events.
Results The treatment effect estimate was an 84\% (95\% confidence interval = 75-89\%) reduction in mean number of scratching events relative to baseline compared with placebo (p {\textless} 0.0001). Owner-assessed satisfactory quality of life was status quo and rated as 'good' or 'could not be better' in six/11 dogs and improved in four/11 dogs. The most prevalent adverse events were increased appetite in nine/12 dogs and transient ataxia in nine/12 dogs. There was one dog withdrawn by the owner 7 days after crossover to PGN owing to persistent ataxia. No dogs needed rescue analgesia during the trial.
Conclusions and clinical relevance PGN is superior to placebo in the reduction of clinical signs of SM-related CNeP in dogs. At a dose range of 13-19 mg kg(-1) orally twice daily, the encountered adverse events were acceptable to all but one owner.},

An increased prevalence of the disease is seen in the English Springer spaniel (ESS), and this breed suffer from a severe form with young to middle aged female dogs being predisposed. The disease shares histological features with those of human viral hepatitis, although the specific aetiological agent has not yet been identified. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II alleles and haplotypes are associated with susceptibility/resistance to CH in the ESS. Sequence-based genotyping of the polymorphic exon 2 from DLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 class II loci were performed in 66 ESSs with CH and 84 healthy controls. There was a significant difference in the distribution of the protective alleles DRB1*00501 (3.0\% vs. 12.0\%, odds ratio [OR] = 0.23, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06-0.74) and DQB1*00501 (3.8\% vs. 12.0\%, OR = 0.29, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.85) between cases and controls. The haplotype DLA-DRB1*00501/DQA1*00301/DQB1*00501 was present in 11.9\% of controls and 3.0\% of cases and was significantly associated with protection against disease development (OR = 0.26, 95\% CI = 0.08-0.80). There was a significant difference in the distribution of the risk alleles DRB1*00601 (14.4\% vs. 6.5\%, OR = 2.40, 95\% CI = 1.10-5.63) and DQB1*00701 (14.4\% vs. 6.5\%, OR = 2.40, 95\% CI = 1.10-5.63) between cases and controls. A risk haplotype (DLA-DRB1*00601/DQA1*005011/DQB1*00701) was present in 14.4\% of cases and 6.5\% of controls and conferred an elevated risk of developing CH with an OR of 3.13 (95\% CI = 1.20-8.26).

	abstract = {Objective-To measure the absolute and relative volumes of cranial vaults of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and other brachycephalic dogs for the purpose of evaluating a possible association between the volume of the caudal fossa (fossa caudalis cerebri; CF) and existence of Chiari-like malformation (CLM) and syringohydromyelia in CKCSs.
Animals-40 CKCSs and 25 brachycephalic dogs.
Procedures-The intracranial vault of all dogs was evaluated via computed tomography followed by magnetic resonance imaging. Volumes of the CF and the rostral and medial fossa (fossa rostralis et medialis cerebri) were determined. The ratio of the absolute volumes was calculated as the volume index (VI).
Results-All CKCSs had cranial characteristics consistent with CLIVI. There were no significant differences between CKCSs and brachycephalic dogs with respect to the VI and absolute volumes of the CF and rostral and medial fossas. The CKCSs without syringohydromyelia (n = 26) had a median VI of 0.1842, and CKCSs with syringohydromyelia (14) had a median VI of 0.1805. The median VI of other brachycephalic dogs was 0.1864. The VI did not differ among these 3 groups.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results of this study suggested that descent of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum and the presence of syringohydromyelia in CKCSs are not necessarily associated with a volume reduction in the CF of the skull. (Am J Vet Res 2009;70:508-512)},

	abstract = {Objectives
To characterise the symptomatic phenotype of Chiari-like malformation (CM), secondary syringomyelia (SM) and brachycephaly in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel using morphometric measurements on mid-sagittal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) of the brain and craniocervical junction.
Methods
This retrospective study, based on a previous quantitative analysis in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB), used 24 measurements taken on 130 T1-weighted MRI of hindbrain and cervical region. Associated brachycephaly was estimated using 26 measurements, including rostral forebrain flattening and olfactory lobe rotation, on 72 T2-weighted MRI of the whole brain. Both study cohorts were divided into three groups; Control, CM pain and SM and their morphometries compared with each other.
Results
Fourteen significant traits were identified in the hindbrain study and nine traits in the whole brain study, six of which were similar to the GB and suggest a common aetiology. The Control cohort had the most elliptical brain (p = 0.010), least olfactory bulb rotation (p = 0.003) and a protective angle (p = 0.004) compared to the other groups. The CM pain cohort had the greatest rostral forebrain flattening (p = 0.007), shortest basioccipital (p = 0.019), but a greater distance between the atlas and basioccipital (p = 0.002) which was protective for SM. The SM cohort had two conformation anomalies depending on the severity of craniocervical junction incongruities; i) the proximity of the dens (p {\textless} 0.001) ii) increased airorhynchy with a smaller, more ventrally rotated olfactory bulb (p {\textless} 0.001). Both generated 'concertina' flexures of the brain and craniocervical junction.
Conclusion
Morphometric mapping provides a diagnostic tool for quantifying symptomatic CM, secondary SM and their relationship with brachycephaly. It is hypothesized that CM pain is associated with increased brachycephaly and SM can result from different combinations of abnormalities of the forebrain, caudal fossa and craniocervical junction which compromise the neural parenchyma and impede cerebrospinal fluid flow.},

	abstract = {Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which afflicts 1 in 3500 boys, is one of the most common genetic disorders of children. This fatal degenerative condition is caused by an absence or deficiency of dystrophin in striated muscle. Most affected patients have inherited or spontaneous deletions in the dystrophin gene that disrupt the reading frame resulting in unstable truncated products. For these patients, restoration of the reading frame via antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach. The major DMD deletion "hot spot" is found between exons 45 and 53, and skipping exon 51 in particular is predicted to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in the greatest number of patients. Currently the mdx mouse is the most widely used animal model of DMD, although its mild phenotype limits its suitability in clinical trials. The Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model has a severe phenotype, but due to its large size, is expensive to use. Both these models have mutations in regions of the dystrophin gene distant from the commonly mutated DMD "hot spot".
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we describe the severe phenotype, histopathological findings, and molecular analysis of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy (CKCS-MD). The dogs harbour a missense mutation in the 59 donor splice site of exon 50 that results in deletion of exon 50 in mRNA transcripts and a predicted premature truncation of the translated protein. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 51 in cultured myoblasts from an affected dog restored the reading frame and protein expression.
Conclusions/Significance: Given the small size of the breed, the amiable temperament and the nature of the mutation, we propose that CKCS-MD is a valuable new model for clinical trials of antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping and other therapeutic approaches for DMD.},

	abstract = {Episodic falling syndrome (EFS) is a canine paroxysmal hypertonicity disorder found in Cavalier King Charles spaniels. Episodes are triggered by exercise, stress or excitement and characterized by progressive hypertonicity throughout the thoracic and pelvic limbs, resulting in a characteristic 'deer-stalking' position and/or collapse. We used a genome-wide association strategy to map the EFS locus to a 3.48 Mb critical interval on canine chromosome 7. By prioritizing candidate genes on the basis of biological plausibility, we found that a 15.7 kb deletion in BCAN, encoding the brain-specific extracellular matrix proteoglycan brevican, is associated with EFS. This represents a compelling causal mutation for EFS, since brevican has an essential role in the formation of perineuronal nets governing synapse stability and nerve conduction velocity. Mapping of the deletion breakpoint enabled the development of Multiplex PCR and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) genotyping tests that can accurately distinguish normal, carrier and affected animals. Wider testing of a larger population of CKCS dogs without a history of EFS from the USA revealed that carriers are extremely common (12.9\%). The development of molecular genetic tests for the EFS microdeletion will allow the implementation of directed breeding programs aimed at minimizing the number of animals with EFS and enable confirmatory diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of affected dogs.

Additionally, breed-specific reference ranges for CKCS MV measurements are lacking. Study ob-jectives were to assess measurement repeatability and define optimal methods for longitudinal study of echocardiographic MV anatomy and to define preliminary, 2 -dimensional echocardiographic reference ranges for MV measurements in CKCS. Animals: Forty CKCS between 10 and 24 months old.Materials and methods: Pre-and post-sedation 2D echocardiographic images opti-mized for the MV were obtained. The length, width, and area of the anterior and posterior leaflets and the diameter of the MV annulus at end-diastole and end -systole were measured. Measurement repeatability was assessed using \% coefficient of variation and repeatability coefficients.Results: Intra-operator repeatability was best for the operator with previous MV measurement experience, with comparable results for the experienced operator measuring the second operator's images, mimicking a core echocardiography laboratory setting. Except for MV annulus diameter at end-systole, sedation had no significant effect on any MV measurements, nor did it impact measurement repeat-ability. Preliminary, breed-specific reference ranges were defined for the popula-tion, with CKCS often noted to have larger annular diameter at end-systole than end-diastole.Conclusions: Optimal methods for longitudinal study of the MV in CKCS have been proposed, as have 2D preliminary echocardiographic reference ranges for CKCS MV measurements. The MV annulus in CKCS may differ from other breeds. 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study estimates prevalence, breed associations and other risk factors as well as reporting on clinical management.
Methods A cohort study of dogs attending VetCompass practices between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic regression methods.
Results Of 104,212 dogs attending 110 UK practices, the 1-year period prevalence of ASD was 4.40\% (95\% CI: 4.22-4.57). Compared to crossbreds, six breeds showed increased odds of ASD (Cavalier King Charles spaniel, King Charles spaniel, Cockapoo, Shih-tzu, Bichon Frise and Cocker spaniel), and six breeds showed reduced odds (Labrador Retriever, Border collie, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Lurcher, German Shepherd Dog and Boxer). Brachycephalic types had 2.6 times the odds for ASD compared to dolichocephalic types. Medication prescribed for ASD included antimicrobials (n = 480, 20.24\%) and analgesics (n = 284, 11.97\%). Anal sacculectomy was performed in under 1\% of cases.
Conclusions High prevalence, strong breed predispositions and evidence of severity suggested from the antimicrobial and analgesic therapies combined with current substantial knowledge gaps identify ASD as a key research-neglected syndrome in dogs.},

	abstract = {Previous research in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) has found that Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia (CM/SM) are associated with a volume mismatch between the caudal cranial fossa (CCF) and the brain parenchyma contained within. The objectives of this study were to i) compare cerebellar volume in CKCS (a 'high risk' group which frequently develops CM/SM), small breed dogs (medium risk - occasionally develop CM/SM), and Labradors (low risk -CM/SM not reported); ii) evaluate a possible association between increased cerebellar volume and CM/SM in CKCS; iii) investigate the relationship between increased cerebellar volume and crowding of the cerebellum in the caudal part of the CCF (i. e. the region of the foramen magnum). Volumes of three-dimensional, magnetic resonance imaging derived models of the CCF and cerebellum were obtained from 75 CKCS, 44 small breed dogs, and 31 Labradors. As SM is thought to be a late onset disease process, two subgroups were formed for comparison: 18 CKCS younger than 2 years with SM (CM/SM group) and 13 CKCS older than 5 years without SM (CM group). Relative cerebellar volume was defined as the volume of the cerebellum divided by the total volume of brain parenchyma. Our results show that the CKCS has a relatively larger cerebellum than small breed dogs and Labradors and provide evidence that increased cerebellar volume in CKCS is associated with crowding of cerebellum in the caudal part of the CCF. In CKCS there is an association between increased cerebellar volume and SM. These findings have implications for the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of CM/SM, and support the hypothesis that it is a multifactorial disease process governed by increased cerebellar volume and failure of the CCF to reach a commensurate size.},

Methods: Computed tomography and radiographs were obtained for both elbows of 14 dogs with unilateral HCF. The images were evaluated by two boarded radiologists and the prevalence of IOHC in the limb contralaterla to the HCF was identified. Sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic diagnosis of IOHC were determined.
Results: Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle was present in six of 14 dogs, however IOHC was incomplete in three of the six affected dogs. Plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 0.83 (CI 95\%: 0.36 to 0.99) and specificity of 1 (CI 95\%: 0.60 to 1). The Kappa coefficient between radiologists for radiographic examination was 0.714. Of the Spaniel breeds, four out of eight had IOHC in the limb contralateral to the HCF.
Clinical significance: Computed tomography evaluation is more sensitive than radiographs for diagnosis of IOHC, particularly when assessing partial or incomplete IOHC. However, sensitivity of radiographic diagnosis is good and should be adequate in most cases. Clinical suspicion of IOHC in the contralateral limb to the unilateral HCF should be present; however overall frequency may not be as high as previously reported.},

Clinical signs are not consistently apparent on neurologic examination, and owner reporting of signs provides vital clinical history. However, owner questionnaires for this disease are not well developed.
Objectives: To develop a tool to capture owner-reported clinical signs for use in clinical trials and to compare ownerreported signs with the presence of pain on neurologic examination and SM on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Animals: Fifty client-owned CKCS.
Methods: Owners completed a questionnaire and pain/scratch map. Each dog underwent a neurologic examination and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Questionnaire responses were developed into scores, area of shading for pain/scratch maps was measured, and consistency of responses between these tools was assessed. Owner-reported findings were compared with neurologic examination findings and presence and severity of SM on MRI.
Results: Thirty-three dogs were symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic; 30 had SM. The most common sign of pain was crying out when lifted (n = 11). Extent of shaded areas on maps positively correlated with questionnaire scores for pain (r(2) = 0.213, P = 0.006) and scratch (r(2) = 0.104, P = 0.089). Owner-reported findings were not significantly associated with presence or severity of SM or neurologic examination findings. Owner-reported lateralization of signs was significantly associated with SM lateralization (P {\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusions: The questionnaire and maps may be useful for clinical trials. Lack of association of owner-reported signs with SM highlights our lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of pain in this disease.},

The median time to CHF for dogs with NT-proANP levels {\textgreater}1000 pmol/l was 11 months (95\% confidence interval, 5.6-12.6 months), compared to 54 months (46 - infinity) for dogs with concentrations {\textless}= 1000 pmol/l (p {\textless} 0.001). Due to intra- and inter-individual variability, most corresponding analyses for NOx were insignificant but dogs reaching CHF had a lower mean NOx concentration than dogs not reaching CHF (23 vs. 28 mu mol/l, p = 0.016). Risk of CHF increased with increase in heart rate ({\textgreater}130 beats per minute) and grade of murmur ({\textgreater}= 3/6).
Conclusions: The risk of CHF due to mitral regurgitation is increased in dogs with blood NT-proANP concentrations above 1000 pmol/l. Measurement of NT-proANP can be a valuable tool to identify dogs that may develop CHF within months. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The recent studies have demonstrated that the excellent olfactory function of detection dogs might be related with the gut microbes via the bidirectional communications between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. In this study, the gut microbial communities of three types of breeds of detection dogs (Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, and German Shepherd) were studied and compared. The results revealed that the richness and the diversity of gut microbiome German Shepherd dogs were significantly higher than the Labrador Retriever dogs and the Springer Spaniel dogs. At the phylum level, the most predominant gut microbial communities of the detection dogs were comprised of Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Campilobacterota, and Actinobacteriota. At the genus level the most predominant gut microbial communities were comprised of Fusobacterium, Megamonas, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Haemophilus, Anaerobiospirillum, Helicobacter, Megasphaera, Peptoclostridium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus. However, the gut microbial communities of the three dogs group were also obviously different. The mean relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Megamonas, Bacteroides, and Phascolarctobacterium presented significant differences in the three groups. According to the portraits and characteristics of the gut microbiome in young detection dogs, multiple kinds of nutritional interventions could be applied to manipulate the gut microbiota, with the aim of improving the health states and the olfactory performances.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12863-018-0605-z},
	abstract = {Background: Syringomyelia (SM) is a common condition affecting brachycephalic toy breed dogs and is characterized by the development of fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord. It is often concurrent with a complex developmental malformation of the skull and craniocervical vertebrae called Chiari-like malformation (CM) characterized by a conformational change and overcrowding of the brain and cervical spinal cord particularly at the craniocervical junction. CM and SM have a polygenic mode of inheritance with variable penetrance.
Results: We identified six cranial T1-weighted sagittal MRI measurements that were associated to maximum transverse diameter of the syrinx cavity. Increased syrinx transverse diameter has been correlated previously with increased likelihood of behavioral signs of pain. We next conducted a whole genome association study of these traits in 65 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs (33 controls, 32 with extreme phenotypes). Two loci on CFA22 and CFA26 were found to be significantly associated to two traits associated with a reduced volume and altered orientation of the caudal cranial fossa. Their reconstructed haplotypes defined two associated regions that harbor only two genes: PCDH17 on CFA22 and ZWINT on CFA26. PCDH17 codes for a cell adhesion molecule expressed specifically in the brain and spinal cord. ZWINT plays a role in chromosome segregation and its expression is increased with the onset of neuropathic pain. Targeted genomic sequencing of these regions identified respectively 37 and 339 SNPs with significantly associated P values. Genotyping of tagSNPs selected from these 2 candidate loci in an extended cohort of 461 CKCS (187 unaffected, 274 SM affected) identified 2 SNPs on CFA22 that were significantly associated to SM strengthening the candidacy of this locus in SM development.
Conclusions: We identified 2 loci on CFA22 and CFA26 that contained only 2 genes, PCDH17 and ZWINT, significantly associated to two traits associated with syrinx transverse diameter. The locus on CFA22 was significantly associated to SM secondary to CM in the CKCS dog breed strengthening its candidacy for this disease. This study will provide an entry point for identification of the genetic factors predisposing to this condition and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms.},

Animals: 134 healthy adult CKCS.
Methods: Ultrasound examinations were performed by trained observers in awake dogs. M-mode variables included left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, LV free wall and interventricular septal thicknesses at end-diastole and end-systole, and LV fractional shortening (FS\%). The left atrium (LA) and aortic (Ao) diameters were measured using a 2D method, and the LA/Ao was calculated. Pulsed-wave Doppler variables included peak systolic aortic and pulmonary flow velocities, mitral E and A waves, and E/A ratio. Effects of BW, age, and gender on these 15 variables were tested using a general linear model, and RIs were determined by applying the statistical procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
Results: A significant BW effect was observed for all variables, except LA/Ao, FS\%, and mitral E/A ratio. A significant but negligible effect of gender and age was also observed for 5/15 and 4/15 of the tested variables, respectively. Only the BW effect on M-mode variables was considered as clinically relevant and the corresponding regression-based RIs were calculated.
Conclusions: Body weight should be taken into account when interpreting echocardiographic values in CKCS, except for LA/Ao, FS\%, and mitral E/A ratio. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Chiari-like malformation (CM), syringomyelia (SM) and middle ear effusion (also called PSOM) are three conditions that frequently occur in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). Both CM and SM are currently screened in the Netherlands prior to breeding and are graded according to the British Veterinary Association's Kennel Club (BVA/KC) scheme. This study evaluated the prevalence and estimated genetic parameter of CM, SM and middle ear effusion from 12 years of screening results. For SM, the classical method using the BVA/KC scheme, was compared with exact measuring of the central canal dilation. For CM, the BVA/KC scheme was compared with a more detailed scheme. Next to this the presence of microchip artifacts was assessed. 1249 screening of 1020 dogs were re-evaluated. Results indicated the presence of CM in all dogs, suggesting it has become a breed-specific characteristic. And although different grades of CM were observed, the condition did not deteriorate over time. SM was present in 39\% of the dogs and a clear age effect was demonstrated, with SM increasing with age. This emphasizes the importance of screening at appropriate age, since SM can worsen with increasing age. One alternative is to promote repeated measures. The presence of middle ear effusion in this study was 19\%-21\% for dogs younger than 3 years, and 32\%-38\% for dogs older than 3 years. In as much as 60\%, microchip artifacts were noticed, leading to the recommendation to place microchips in another location in breeds that are susceptible to developing SM. Finally, this study estimated the heritability of CM in this population, due to the lack of phenotypic variance, to be very low at 0.02-0.03. The heritability for SM central canal dilatation to be 0.30, compared to 0.13 for the classical BVA/KC method, using a model including the age effect and the combined effect of veterinary clinic and year of the evaluation. Genetic correlations were rather small, ranging from 0.16-0.33. As a conclusion, screening for SM and CM in the entire population should be maintained, and a selection scheme against SM should be based on estimated breeding values for the exact measurement of the central canal dilatation.},

Methods: VHS was measured at intervals before CHF. Delta VHS/month was calculated from sequential pairs of VHS measurements and the interval between them. Diagnostic accuracy and utility were determined by the areas under receiver operating characteristic plots (AUROC), and likelihood ratios (LR).
Results: AUROC for VHS at the onset of CHF was 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.96-0.90), to predict CHF 1-12 months before CHF was 0.74 (95\% CI, 0.81-0.66), and for.VHS/month at CHF was 0.98 (95\% CI, 0.99-0.96). Interval LRs and their cutoff values for CHF were for VHS: 13 (95\% CI, 20-7.3) at {\textgreater}= 12.7; 1.2 (95\% CI, 2.0-0.68) between 12.7 and 12.0; 0.04 (95\% CI, 0.18-0.01) at {\textless}= 12.0, and for.VHS/month: 15 (95\% CI, 30-7.7) at {\textgreater}= 0.08; 0.72 (95\% CI, 2.0-0.25) between 0.08 and 0.06; and 0.05 (95\% CI, 0.13-0.02) at {\textless}= 0.06.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Under the conditions of this study, VHS and particularly Delta VHS/month are useful measurements for detecting onset of CHF in CKCS with MR.},

CM, considered ubiquitous in the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) population, results in abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics which can lead to the development of SM. The clinical signs associated with CM/SM are frequently confused with other otologic and dermatologic conditions, which may delay appropriate treatment. A definitive diagnosis of CM/SM requires advanced imaging; however, due to expense associated with this, many cases are managed presumptively and symptomatically for the condition. The primary goal of treatment is to manage neuropathic pain and neurologic deficits through pharmaceutical or surgical approaches. Current literature suggests that most CM/SMaffected dogs have progression of their clinical signs in spite of medical or surgical management; however, most maintain a good quality of life based on owner assessments. Lack of correlation between structural markers of disease and clinician and owner-derived measures of neuropathic pain highlight the need for more robust, quantitative measures of pain in this common veterinary disease.

Clinical examination revealed the presence of raised nipple-like structures, resembling the nipples and extending from chest to groin region. However, the testes could not be detected. PCR analysis revealed the absence of the Y chromosome. A corrective surgery, including clitoridectomy, and removal of uterus and testicles-like structures, was performed. Histological examination of the removed organs showed underdeveloped testes and well-recognized endometrium.

The weaknesses of the statistical assumptions made are discussed. There was no evidence to support a gender predisposition for the development of this condition. English cocker spaniels are significantly over-rep resented, with a mean relative risk estimate of 7.3.

Little is known regarding platelet, plasma, valvular, or myocardial 5HT concentration ([5HT]) in affected dogs. We quantified [5HT] in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), mitral valve leaflets (MV), and left ventricular myocardium (LV).
Animals: Forty-five dogs comprised 4 plasma groups of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) or non-CKCS, either healthy (CON) or MMVD affected: CKCS CON (n = 12); non-CKCS CON (n = 8); CKCS MMVD (n = 14); non-CKCS MMVD (n = 11). Twenty-four dogs comprised 3 tissue groups: MMVD (n = 8); other-HD (heart disease) (n = 7); non-HD, extracardiac disease (n = 9).
Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography measured PRP, PPP, MV, and LV [5HT].
Results: Platelet-rich plasma platelet [5HT] was greater in CKCS CON (1.83 femtograms/platelet [fg/plt]; range, 0.20-4.76; P = .002), CKCS MMVD (1.58 fg/plt; range, 0.70-4.03; P = .005), and non-CKCS MMVD (1.72 fg/plt; range, 0.85-4.44; P = .003) versus non-CKCS CON (0.92 fg/plt; range, 0.63-1.30). There was no group difference in PPP [5HT]. MV [5HT] was significantly higher in MMVD (32.4 ng/mg; range, 8.4-106.7) versus non-HD (3.6 ng/mg; range, 0-28.3; P = .01) and LV [5HT] was significantly higher in MMVD (11.9 ng/mg; range, 4.0-104.8) versus other-HD (0.9 ng/mg; range, 0-10.1; P = .011) and non-HD (2.5 ng/mg; range, 0-6.9; P = .001).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Platelet [5HT] was highest in healthy CKCS and both MMVD groups, but plasma [5HT] showed no group differences. Tissue [5HT] was highest in MV and LV of MMVD-affected dogs, suggesting altered 5HT signaling as a potential feature of MMVD. Interactions of platelet, valvular, and myocardial 5HT signaling warrant further investigation.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12917-017-0951-5},
	abstract = {Background: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs, and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is the most studied breed because of the high prevalence, early onset and hereditary component evidenced in the breed. MVD has different severity levels, and there are many practical limitations in identifying its asymptomatic stages. Proteomic techniques are valuable for studying the proteins and peptides involved in cardiovascular diseases, including the period prior to the clinical onset of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify the serum proteins that were differentially expressed in healthy CKCS and those affected by MVD in mild to severe stages. Proteomics analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation and a bioinformatics analysis for the detection of differentially expressed spots. In a comparative analysis, protein spots with a p {\textless} 0.05 (ANOVA) were considered statistically significant and were excised from the gels for analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS for protein identification.
Results: Eight proteins resulted differentially expressed among the groups and significantly related to the progression of the disease. In mild affected group versus healthy dogs complement factor H isoform 2, inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, hemopexin, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7 and CD5 molecule-like resulted to be down-regulated, whereas fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 3A isoform X4 was up-regulated. In severe affected dogs versus healthy group complement factor H isoform 2, calpain-3 isoform X2, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7, CD5 molecule-like and l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase resulted to be down-regulated. Complement factor H isoform 2, calpain-3 isoform X2, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7, CD5 molecule-like and hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase were found to be down-regulated in mild affected group versus healthy dogs. All of these proteins except complement factor H followed a decreasing trend according to the progression of the pathology.
Conclusion: The differential expression of serum proteins demonstrates the possibility these might be valuable for the detection and monitoring of the disease. Further longitudinal studies are required to determine whether differential protein expression occurs sufficiently early in the progression of the disease and with sufficient predictive value to allow proteomics analysis to be used as an early detection and on-line diagnostic tool.},

	abstract = {Selective breeding for desirable traits in strictly controlled populations has generated an extraordinary diversity in canine morphology and behaviour, but has also led to loss of genetic variation and random entrapment of disease alleles. As a consequence, specific diseases are now prevalent in certain breeds, but whether the recent breeding practice led to an overall increase in genetic load remains unclear. Here we generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 20 dogs per breed from eight breeds and document a similar to 10\% rise in the number of derived alleles per genome at evolutionarily conserved sites in the heavily bottlenecked cavalier King Charles spaniel breed (cKCs) relative to in most breeds studied here. Our finding represents the first clear indication of a relative increase in levels of deleterious genetic variation in a specific breed, arguing that recent breeding practices probably were associated with an accumulation of genetic load in dogs. We then use the WGS data to identify candidate risk alleles for the most common cause for veterinary care in cKCs-the heart disease myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). We verify a potential link to MMVD for candidate variants near the heart specific NEBL gene in a dachshund population and show that two of the NEBL candidate variants have regulatory potential in heartderived cell lines and are associated with reduced NEBL isoform nebulette expression in papillary muscle (but not in mitral valve, nor in left ventricular wall). Alleles linked to reduced nebulette expression may hence predispose cKCs and other breeds to MMVD via loss of papillary muscle integrity.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12917-018-1410-7},
	abstract = {Background: Syringomyelia is a pathological condition in which fluid-filled cavities (syringes) form and expand in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is often linked with obstruction of the craniocervical junction and a Chiari malformation, which is similar in both humans and animals. Some brachycephalic toy breed dogs such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are particularly predisposed. The exact mechanism of the formation of syringomyelia is undetermined and consequently with the lack of clinical explanation, engineers and mathematicians have resorted to computer models to identify possible physical mechanisms that can lead to syringes. We developed a computer model of the spinal cavity of a CKCS suffering from a large syrinx. The model was excited at the cranial end to simulate the movement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the spinal cord due to the shift of blood volume in the cranium related to the cardiac cycle. To simulate the normal condition, the movement was prescribed to the CSF. To simulate the pathological condition, the movement of CSF was blocked.
Results: For normal conditions the pressure in the SAS was approximately 400 Pa and the same applied to all stress components in the spinal cord. The stress was uniformly distributed along the length of the spinal cord. When the blockage between the cranial and spinal CSF spaces forced the cord to move with the cardiac cycle, shear and axial normal stresses in the cord increased significantly. The sites where the elevated stress was most pronounced coincided with the axial locations where the syringes typically form, but they were at the perimeter rather than in the central portion of the cord. This elevated stress originated from the bending of the cord at the locations where its curvature was high.
Conclusions: The results suggest that it is possible that repetitive stressing of the spinal cord caused by its exaggerated movement could be a cause for the formation of initial syringes. Further consideration of factors such as cord tethering and the difference in mechanical properties of white and grey matter is needed to fully explore this possibility.},

Animals, materials and methods: Retrospective case series of 38 client-owned dogs.
Demographic, physical examination and diagnostic imaging findings, blood pressure (BP), administration details and outcome were obtained from medical records of dogs receiving carvedilol for preclinical CVD. When possible, additional follow-up information was obtained through telephone interviews with referring veterinarians and owners.
Results: Baseline data and follow-up were evaluated. Median and interquartile range (IQR) for age and weight were 8.6 (7.2-10.8) years and 8.5 (7.6-9.6) kg. 14/38 were male; 33/38 were Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; 33/38 had Stage B2 CVD. The initial dose of carvedilol was 0.31 (0.26-0.35) mg/kg PO twice daily. The carvedilol dose achieved following up titration was 1.11 (0.81-1.32) mg/kg twice daily. No adverse effects were recorded during up titration. Median survival for all dogs was 48.5 months with a 95\% CI of 38.3-58.6.
Conclusions: This study suggests that carvedilol at the dose reported herein is well tolerated in small breed dogs with preclinical CVD. Prospective studies to evaluate efficacy are warranted. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Method Analysis of 273 T1-weighted mid-sagittal DICOM sequences of the hindbrain and craniocer-vical junction from 99 Chihuahuas, 42 Affenpinschers and 132 CKCSs. The study compared 22 morphometric features (11 lines, eight angles and three ratios) of dogs with and without SM using refined techniques based on previous studies of the Griffon Bruxellois (GB) using Discriminant Function Analysis and ANOVA with post-hoc corrections.
Results The analysis identified 14/22 significant traits for SM in the three dog breeds, five of which were identical to those reported for the GB and suggest inclusion of a common aetiology. One ratio, caudal fossa height to the length of the skull base extended to an imaginary point of alignment between the atlas and supraoccipital bones, was common to all three breeds (p values 0.029 to {\textless} 0.001). Associated with SM were a reduced occipital crest and two acute changes in angulation i) 'sphenoid flexure' at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis ii) 'cervical flexure' at the foramen magnum allied with medulla oblongata elevation. Comparing dogs with and without SM, each breed had a unique trait: Chihuahua had a smaller angle between the dens, atlas and basioccipital bone (p value {\textless} 0.001); Affenpinschers had a smaller dis-tance from atlas to dens (p value 0.009); CKCS had a shorter distance between the spheno-occipital synchondrosis and atlas (p value 0.007).
Conclusion The selected morphometries successfully characterised conformational changes in the brain and craniocervical junction that might form the basis of a diagnostic tool for all breeds. The severity of SM involved a spectrum of abnormalities, incurred by changes in both angulation and size that could alter neural parenchyma compliance and/or impede cerebrospinal fluid channels.},

Animals studied A total of 10 eyes, four normal and six glaucomatous eyes, from normal and affected American Cocker Spaniels with primary glaucoma were studied. All eyes were assessed by neuro-ophthalmic examination, tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy prior to enucleation.
Methods Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed to evaluate BDNF and TrkB receptor expression in retina and optic nerve in normal and glaucomatous dogs.
Results In all normal eyes BDNF immunostaining was detected in the cytoplasm of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), nerve fiber layer (NFL), optic nerve head cells, and lamina cribosa cells. In all glaucomatous eyes BDNF was more evident in RGC, NFL and lamina cribosa cells. TrkB receptor was detected in the cytoplasm of RGC, NFL and ONH bundles in all normal eyes, and in a more intense pattern in all glaucomatous eyes.
Conclusions BDNF retrograde axonal transport is substantially inhibited by intraocular pressure elevation. TrkB accumulation at the ONH in glaucoma suggests a role for neurotrophin deprivation in the pathogenesis of RGC death in canine glaucoma, as well as a possible paracrine and/or autocrine signaling within the lamina cribosa. Neurotrophin signaling may regulate more than neuronal development, survival and differentiation. BDNF neurotrophin and its TrkB receptor expression by lamina cribosa cells and ONH astrocytes in glaucomatous eyes may help to determine the role of these cells as a paracrine source in terms of retinal ganglion cell survival, during episodes of elevated intraocular pressure.},

	abstract = {Mitral regurgitation (MR) due to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is a frequent finding in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs). Sinus arrhythmia and atrial premature complexes leading to R-R interval variations occur in dogs. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the duration of the RR interval immediately influences the degree of MR assessed by echocardiography in dogs. Clinical examination including echocardiography was performed in 103 privately-owned dogs: 16 control Beagles, 70 CKCSs with different degree of MR and 17 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of congestive heart failure due to MMVD. The severity of MR was evaluated in apical four-chamber view using colour Doppler flow mapping (maximum \% of the left atrium area) and colour Doppler M-mode (duration in ms). The influence of the ratio between present and preceding R-R interval on MR severity was evaluated in 10 consecutive R-R intervals using a linear mixed model for repeated measurements.
MR severity was increased when a short R-R interval was followed by a long R-R interval in CKCSs with different degrees of MR (P{\textless}0.005 when adjusted for multiple testing). The relationship was not significant in control dogs with minimal MR and in dogs with severe MR and clinical signs of heart failure. In conclusion, MR severity increases in long R-R intervals when these follow a short R-R interval in CKCSs with different degrees of MR due to asymptomatic MMVD. Thus, R-R interval variations may affect the echocardiographic grading of MR in CKCSs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Myxomatous mitral valve disease is a familial disease in human beings as well and genetic mutations have been associated with its development. We hypothesized that a genetic mutation associated with the development of the human form of MMVD was associated with the development of canine MMVD. DNA was isolated from blood samples from 10 CKCS and 10 Dachshunds diagnosed with MMVD, and whole genome sequences from each animal were obtained. Variant calling from whole genome sequencing data was performed using a standardized bioinformatics pipeline for all samples. After filtering, the canine genes orthologous to the human genes known to be associated with MMVD were identified and variants were assessed for likely pathogenic implications.
No variant was found in any of the genes evaluated that was present in least eight of 10 affected CKCS or Dachshunds. Although mitral valve disease in the CKCS and Dachshund is a familial disease, we did not identify genetic cause in the genes responsible for the human disease in the dogs studied here.

This study evaluated N-terminal (NT) fragment pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in 39 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with pre-clinical mitral valve regurgitation (MR), sixteen dogs with clinical signs of heart failure (HF) and thirteen healthy control dogs. Twenty seven CKCS and tell control dogs were re-examined 4 years after the initial examination and the status of the dogs 5 years after the initial examination was determined by telephone calls to the owner. All dogs were evaluated by clinical examination and echocardiography. CKCS with severe MR had higher NT-proANP and NT-proBNP compared to controls and CKCS with less severe MR. Dogs with clinical signs of HF had markedly elevated NT-proANP and NT-proBNP. Plasma concentrations of the natriuretic peptides measured at re-examination could predict progression in regurgitant jet size. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Signs of increased intraventricular pressure and atrophy of the cerebral white matter have been found in dogs with ventriculomegaly, which would imply increased intraventricular pressure and, therefore, a pathological condition, i.e., to some extent. Reduced periventricular blood flow was found in people with high elevated intraventricular pressure. The aim of this study was to compare periventricular brain perfusion in dogs with and without ventriculomegaly using perfusion weighted-magnetic-resonance-imaging to clarify as to whether ventriculomegaly might be associated with an increase in intraventricular pressure. Perfusion was measured in 32 Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) with ventriculomegaly, 10 CKCSs were examined as a control group. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using free-hand regions of interest (ROI) in five brain regions: periventricular white matter, caudate nucleus, parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. CBF was significantly lower in the periventricular white matter of the dogs with ventriculomegaly (p = 0.0029) but not in the other ROIs. Reduction of periventricular CBF might imply increase of intraventricular pressure in ventriculomegaly.},

The essay has two purposes. The first is theoretical. I aim to make explicit the often unspoken (perhaps even unconscious) theoretical subtexts that have shaped readings of female sexuality, and I propose some historical reasons for the dominance of certain strains of feminism those best known as "subordination feminism" and "cultural feminism" in criticism of early modern literature. The second purpose is hermeneutic. I explore the alternative readings that become available if we approach Shakespeare's and Spenser's work through the lens of one competing strand of feminist thought, described by its practitioners as "prosex" or "sex-radical" feminism. In this essay, my reading of A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Faerie Queene limits its interpretive frameworks to those offered by sex-radical feminism and the strands of queer theory that emerged from it. Drawing on these often overlooked frameworks, I explore the tensions and hierarchies among women in the play and the poem to challenge the assumption that women's relationships are always egalitarian and nurturing; I propose that homo- and heteroerotic desires are not mutually exclusive but may coexist in these works; and I argue that female masochism is not always a pathology that enables patriarchy but can be a legitimate form of desire that challenges traditional ideas of normal and proper female behavior.

Study design Controlled clinical study. Animals Dogs with HIF (14 dogs, 21 elbows) and dogs without HIF (20 dogs, 31 elbows). Methods A caudo-medial arthroscope portal was used to inspect all elbow joints. Arthroscopic features of 21 joints of dogs with HIF were compared with 31 control elbows of HIF- negative dogs. Results All elbows with HIF showed a focal cartilage lesion on the caudal aspect of the humeral condyle. The lesions ranged from a simple indentation into the articular surface to a full thickness cartilage erosion. Humero-anconeal incongruity was identified in all elbows with HIF as absence of joint space at the point of contact between the tip of the anconeal process and the cartilage lesion, with a wider joint space distally within the ulnar trochlear notch. None of the elbows without HIF showed the cartilage lesion or evidence of humero-anconeal incongruity. Conclusion Use of a novel arthroscope portal allowed description of a previously unreported cartilage lesion on the caudal humeral condyle of dogs with HIF. The lesion was found in all dogs with HIF but in no dogs without HIF. Clinical significance Humero-anconeal incongruity and an associated cartilage lesion appear to be present in dogs with HIF. We propose that this lesion may be associated with humero-anconeal incongruity. This may be considered as a possible future therapeutic target for HIF.},

	abstract = {In 23 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 12 with mild mitral valve insufficiency (MVI) and 11 controls, the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was assessed by measuring the plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in 5 different settings. The dogs were sampled at the clinic before the trial and thereafter at home and at the clinic; during both a period on control diet and a period on low sodium diet. The dogs with mild MVI had the highest median PRA and PAC in all 5 settings. An analysis of variance accordingly showed that dogs with mild MVI had significantly higher PRA (p{\textless}0.0001) and PAC (p = 0.03) than controls, and that the sodium intake and place of blood sampling did not significantly affect this finding. The sodium intake had highly significant effects on PRA and PAC, and the place of blood sampling had no significant effects on PRA and PAC. The activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum was lower in dogs with mild MVI than in controls (p = 0.0002). The plasma levels of endothelin-1, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin, 3 peptides of pathophysiologic importance in congestive heart failure, were not significantly changed by the disease.
The early activation of the RAS in dogs with MVI suggests that the valvular disease process itself might be the cause of the activation, but confirmation of this requires further studies.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Humeral intracondylar fissure (HIF) is a common orthopaedic disease affecting Spaniel breed dogs. Surgical treatment traditionally involved placement of a large transcondylar screw to avoid catastrophic consequences such as a fracture. The reported complication rate related to placement of a transcondylar screw is high and varies between 8 and 59.5\%. A recent study describing a cartilaginous lesion present on the caudal aspect of the humerus of spaniel breed dogs with HIF has suggested that humero-anconeal incongruency may be the cause of this abnormal cyclical loading that subsequently leads to stress fracture formation. Theoretically, healing of the HIF could therefore be achieved by performing a proximal ulnar osteotomy and therefore interrupting the abnormal, cyclical loading applied by the anconeal process on the humeral condyle. The purpose of this report is to describe the first case of humeral intracondylar fissure in a Shetland sheepdog and to test our hypothesis that proximal ulnar osteotomy can promote healing of the humeral intracondylar fissure. A seven-month-old male Shetland Sheepdog was presented for assessment of thoracic limb lameness of 3 weeks duration. Orthopaedic examination revealed severe discomfort in elbow extension, bilaterally. CT-scan confirmed presence of a complete humeral intracondylar fissure (HIF), bilaterally, and arthroscopic examination of both elbows confirmed the presence of the cartilaginous lesion previously reported in dogs suffering from HIF. A staged oblique proximal ulnar osteotomy was performed to address the humero-anconeal incongruency believed to be the cause of HIF formation. Orthopaedic examination performed 5 weeks after each surgical procedure confirmed that pain previously present on elbow manipulation had subsided. Follow-up examination performed 8 months after the second surgery revealed the dog to be sound at walking on the thoracic limbs with no discomfort present on elbow manipulation. Repeated CT scan confirmed complete healing of both HIFs. This is the first report documenting the presence of HIF in a Shetland sheepdog and complete healing of both HIFs following a proximal ulnar osteotomy.},

	abstract = {Observer variation in diagnosing mild mitral regurgitation in dogs by cardiac auscultation was assessed by having 6 veterinarians with different levels of experience examine 57 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Comparisons with color Doppler echocardiography and phonocardiography were made, and the effects of 2 physical maneuvers on the auscultatory findings were evaluated. Using mildly diseased dogs, interobserver agreement in diagnosing the presence or absence of left-sided murmurs ranged from 63\% to 88\%. The agreement with phonocardiography (range, 53-91\%) increased with the amount of observer experience. The 2 most experienced observers could discern soft ejection murmurs from regurgitant murmurs and were able to diagnose 89\% of the dogs with regurgitant jets larger than 30\% of the left atrial area. In general, less experienced observers diagnosed most jets larger than 50\%. In many dogs with small jets, no murmur was found by auscultation and phonocardiography. The audibility of mild regurgitation was significantly reduced in dogs that were difficult to auscultate. Early systolic murmurs were typical of mild regurgitation, whereas holosystolic murmurs typified severe regurgitation. In a few dogs, late systolic murmurs alternated with holosystolic murmurs. Systolic clicks were found phonocardiographically in 18 dogs with mild to moderate regurgitation, but the audibility apparently was low. In many mildly affected dogs, physical maneuvers increased murmur intensity. Thus, some form of dynamic auscultation might facilitate the diagnosis of mild regurgitation. Auscultatory findings in mild regurgitation appear to depend on observer experience, circulatory status, and how difficult the dog is to auscultate.},

Against the backdrop of the pervasive controversy over l'animalite, Elisabeth Charlotte von der Pfalz, living in what she considered an 'alien world', writes: 'Dogs are the best people I have found in France, I always have four of them with and around me'. I explore in Madame's letters the contours of the controversy over l'animalite, the borderlines of the human, human/animal relationships, and the important role of animals, notably dogs, in her daily life. I consider among other points Madame's philosophical and theological reflections concerning animals, Mignard's lost portrait of her favourite dog, physical and affective comfort, true friendship (comparisons between the friendships of humans and that of dogs), and finally, Madame's dogs as actors in anecdotes she relates to her correspondents. Echoing Sainte-Beuve's declaration, 'Madame est un utile, un precieux et incomparable temoin de moeurs', prominent historians of our day such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, remind us of Madame's extensive epistolary network, extolling the merit of her letters as an exceptional mirror of a crucial period of early modern Europe.},

This case describes the clinical, radiographic, echocardiographic, gross pathologic, and histopathologic features of a dog presented in acute respiratory distress secondary to acute onset right to left shunting through the interatrial septum. This was later documented to be due to a tear in the septum secondary to tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

MethodsA retrospective review of medical records of cavalier King Charles spaniels diagnosed with middle ear effusion and treated with tympanostomy tubes placement between 2012 and 2014 was performed. Outcome was assessed based on a telephone questionnaire.
ResultsTwenty-two tympanostomy tubes were successfully placed in the tympanic membrane in 12 cavalier King Charles spaniels under video-otoscopic guidance using a rigid endoscope and grasping forceps. Follow-up based on an owner questionnaire was available for 11/12 dogs. Subjective improvement in hearing was observed in 9/11 dogs with three dogs achieving normal hearing, according to the owners, and six demonstrating partial improvements. Out of 11 dogs, 10 dogs were reported with improved quality of life. Pruritus of the ears resolved in 3/9 dogs. Clinical signs recurred in four dogs because of tube dislodgement.
Clinical SignificanceVideo-otoscopic tympanostomy tube placement appeared to be indicated as a treatment for middle ear effusion in cavalier King Charles spaniels. It subjectively improved hearing, pruritus and quality of life in most dogs. The tympanostomy tubes dislodged in some cases, leading to recurrence of clinical signs, which were effectively eliminated by replacement of a fresh tube.},

Clinical signs can vary from low-grade recurrent gastrointestinal signs to acute exacerbations that are indistinguishable from classical acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a significant cause of chronic pain in dogs, which must not be underestimated. It also results in progressive impairment of endocrine and exocrine function and the eventual development of diabetes mellitus or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or both in some affected dogs at end stage. The etiology is unknown in most cases. Chronic pancreatitis shows an increased prevalence in certain breeds, and recent work in English Cocker Spaniels suggests it is part of a polysystemic immune-mediated disease in this breed. The histological and clinical appearance is different in different breeds, suggesting that etiologies may also be different. Diagnosis is challenging because the sensitivities of the available noninvasive tests are relatively low. However, with an increased index of suspicion, clinicians will recognize more cases that will allow them to institute supportive treatment to improve the quality of life of the patient.

When the two conditions occur concurrently, it is possible that syringomyelia may develop more slowly, resulting in presentation with clinical signs in middle to old age.

In addition videoanalysis of ciliary function in specimens of nasal mucosa of one dog was done using a phase-contrast microscope.  Besides regions of normal beat pattern, regions with an asynchronous ciliary beat pattern were found.

	abstract = {Objectives
To measure accuracy and variability of diagnosis by radiography of heart enlargement (HE) and heart failure (HF) in mitral regurgitation (MR).
Methods
Sixteen readers representing four levels of experience evaluated 50 sets of radiographs with varying severity of MR for presence or absence of HE, left atrial enlargement (LAE) and HF. The performance of the readers was compared with a reference standard, using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The interreader agreement value kappa (K) was calculated. A subset of difficult cases of HF was analysed before and after removing an outlying reader from each group.
Results
AUC for HE was 0 center dot 89, for LAE it was 0 center dot 93 and for HF it was 0 center dot 92. Experience increased certainty of diagnosis but not accuracy. K ranges were HE, 0 center dot 53 to 0 center dot 67; LAE, 0 center dot 61 to 0 center dot 69 and HF, 0 center dot 49 to 0 center dot 58. When only difficult cases of HF were read, accuracy decreased and experienced readers performed better than inexperienced. When outlying readers were excluded, the differences between experienced and inexperienced readers increased.
Clinical Significance
LAE, not HE, should be used to evaluate the heart size and indirectly the severity of MR on radiographs. For HF, agreement among individual readers was only moderate. Studies of reader accuracy should consider the effects of interreader variability.},

Approximately 10 weeks previously the owner reported removing a large number of barley grass seeds from the dog's coat and ears. Eight weeks later the dog was treated for pneumonia, based on clinical findings and thoracic radiographs. In the 4 days prior to referral the dog had a decreased appetite, was lethargic and appeared unable to urinate voluntarily. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog was bright and alert but unable to walk. Upper motor neuron signs were indicative of T3L3 spinal lesion. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an abnormal low signal linear structure within the left T12T13 neural foramen extending to the left lateral aspects of the thoracic spinal cord was detected, consistent with a foreign body. A left T12T13 lateral hemilaminectomy was performed and a grass seed removed from a tract extending caudally from the T1213 space, dorsal to the lumbar transverse processes and the rib head. The dog made a rapid recovery after surgery with full resolution of clinical signs. DIAGNOSIS: Spinal empyema caused by a migrating barley grass awn (Hordeum spp.). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Advanced imaging using MRI can bea valuable method for localising foreign bodies prior to exploratory surgery. Animals presenting with neurological signs should have foreign body reactions included as a differential diagnosis.},

Procedures The medical records of dogs that underwent AGV implantation from January 2010 to December 2019 were reviewed to assess the duration of post-surgical vision preservation (PVP). The relationship between PVP and the underlying cause of glaucoma, implant placement, and preoperative intraocular pressure was evaluated. Results One hundred and thirty-two eyes of 122 dogs (mean age, 8.3 +/- 2.6 years) were included. The mean +/- standard error of PVP for all eyes was 57.5 +/- 3.9 months. PVP in the dogs with primary acute glaucoma and prior history of cataract surgery was 56.4 +/- 4.7 and 59.3 +/- 5.9 months, respectively (p = .712). The PVP of the Shiba Inu, American Cocker Spaniel, and other breeds was 63.1 +/- 5.5, 33.7 +/- 5.3, and 59.1 +/- 6.3 months, respectively (p {\textless} .05). The PVP in dogs with medial implantation was 61.9 +/- 4.7 months, and in those with lateral implantation was 45.4 +/- 6.4 months (p = .034). Among the 132 eyes investigated, 48 (36.4\%) lost vision by the last follow-up, and 18 eyes retained vision for more than 5 years. Two of the total number of eyes retained their vision for more than 8 years. Conclusions The vision outcomes regarding the use of AGV for the management of canine glaucoma were favorable in dogs.},

	abstract = {Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the single most common acquired heart disease of the dog and is particularly common in small pedigree breed dogs such as the Cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). There are limited data on the mitral valve transcriptome and the aim of this study was to use the microarray technology in conjunction with bioinformatics platforms to analyse transcript changes in MMVD in CKCS compared to normal dogs (non-CKCS). Differentially expressed genes (n = 5397) were identified using cut-off settings of fold change, false discovery rate (FDR) and P {\textless} 0.05. In total, 4002 genes were annotated to a specific transcript in the Affymetrix canine database, and after further filtering, 591 annotated canine genes were identified: 322 (55\%) were up-regulated and 269 (45\%) were down-regulated. Canine microRNAs (cfa-miR; n = 59) were also identified.
Gene ontology and network analysis platforms identified between six and 10 significantly different biological function clusters from which the following were selected as relevant to MMVD: inflammation, cell movement, cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix organisation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified three canonical pathways relevant to MMVD: caveolar-mediated endocytosis, remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions, and endothelin-1 signalling. Considering the biological relevance to MMVD, the gene families of importance with significant difference between groups included collagens, ADAMTS peptidases, proteoglycans, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, basement membrane components, cathepsin S, integrins, tight junction cell adhesion proteins, cadherins, other matrix-associated proteins, and members of the serotonin (5-HT)/transforming growth factor -beta signalling pathway.

Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage showed an excessive amount of eosinophils. The IgG was within normal limits and the IgM was increased.

The emission spectra represent reddish-orange performance, which is due to the D-5(0) -{\textgreater} F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transition of Eu ions. The red emission from transition D-5(0) -{\textgreater} F-7(2) (red) is dominate over that of D-5(0) -{\textgreater} F-7(1) (orange). The impact of doping Eu3+ and PL properties were investigated, and we propose a feasible interpretation, which this phosphor could be a good candidate as a reddish-orange component in the fabrication of white LEDs.},

	abstract = {Objective-To describe the clinical and morphologic characteristics of nasal dermoid sinus cysts in the dog.
Study Design-Retrospective clinical study.
Animals-Six client-owned dogs.
Methods-Medical records (1995 to 1999) of 6 dogs that had a discharging sinus in the midline of the nose removed surgically were reviewed for signalment, physical examination, surgical and histopathologic findings, and outcome.
Results-Three golden retrievers, 1 springer spaniel, 1 cocker spaniel, and 1 Brittany spaniel with a history of intermittent discharge from a small opening in the midline on the bridge of the nose at the junction between the nasal planum and the skin were identified. The condition was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, and previous surgical excision had been unsuccessful in 3 dogs. None of the dogs had any other congenital defects, and all dogs responded to complete surgical excision of the tract and cyst. On histopathologic examination of excised tissue, there were adnexal structures along a tract lined with stratified squamous epithelium, consistent with a developmental abnormality of ectodermal tissue.
Conclusions-The lesions were diagnosed as nasal dermoid sinus cysts, similar to the congenital condition described in humans. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts are rare developmental defects related to abnormal development of the pre-nasal space and may extend into the cranial vault causing cerebral abscesses or recurrent meningitis. Complete surgical excision has a good prognosis.
Clinical Relevance-This is a new condition that should be added to the surgical differential diagnosis for a discharging sinus over the external nares in dogs. (C) Copyright 2002 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.},

Three-dimensional images were created and volumes of the fossae, brain parenchyma and ventricular system were calculated from which percentages of CCF, CCFP and V were created. If present, syrinx size was measured from its maximal transverse width. The percentages were statistically compared between groups, and correlation between percentages and syrinx dimensions was made.
Results: CKCS with SM had significantly higher CCFP (P=0 center dot 0001) and V (P=0 center dot 0002) to those without but no significant difference in CCF (P=0 center dot 925). There was a positive correlation between CCFP and syrinx width (Pearson r=0 center dot 437) and ventricle size to syrinx width (Spearman r=0 center dot 627).
Clinical Significance: A more marked overcrowding of the CCF is associated with SM, which may explain the high incidence of SM in CKCS with CM. The association between ventricle and syrinx dimensions supports the theory that SM development is the result of altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.},

METHODS: Formalin-fixed tissues were processed into paraffin wax and epoxy resin for light and transmission electron microscopy of variously stained tissue sections.
RESULTS: Significant lesions relevant to the disease were found only in the brain. They consisted of hypoplasia of the cerebellum and the presence of large pale inclusions in the perikaryon of neurons in the neocortex and in macrophages. The inclusion material was not compartmentalised and did not stain for carbohydrate, mucopolysaccharide or lipid. This material displaced nuclei to the periphery of the cells where they were seen as basophilic distorted crescent-shaped structures.
CONCLUSIONS: The inclusions were probably made of polymerised protein similar, though not identical, to those of Pick, Lewy and Collins bodies that characterise a variety of chronic neurodegenerative diseases of humans. A genetic basis to this disease was considered probable.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine the prevalence of the breed-related glaucomas in pure-bred dogs presented to the veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America that participate in the Veterinary Medical Data Base (VMDB).
Materials and methods In this retrospective study, age of first diagnosis, breed, and gender data for all breeds of dogs were collected from the VMDB with the clinical diagnosis of primary glaucoma (glaucoma-NOS) at 5-10 year intervals from 1964 to 2002. The prevalence for each breed (affected dogs compared to all dogs of each breed), any changes over the 38 years, and any gender differences for these glaucomas were determined.
Results The prevalence of the primary breed-related glaucomas has gradually increased from 0.29\% (1964-1973); 0.46\% (1974-1983); 0.76\% (1984-1993); to 0.89\% (1994-2002). Breeds that consistently featured among the highest 10 for glaucoma prevalence from four different periods (1964 to 2002) included American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Wire Fox Terrier, and Boston Terrier. During the last observation period (1994-2002), 22 different breeds had 1\% or higher prevalence of the glaucomas. The highest prevalence of glaucomas in 1994-2002 by breed included: American Cocker Spaniel (5.52\%); Basset Hound (5.44\%); Chow Chow (4.70\%); Shar-Pei (4.40\%); Boston Terrier (2.88\%); Wire Fox Terrier (2.28\%); Norwegian ElkHound (1.98\%); Siberian Husky (1.88\%); Cairn Terrier (1.82\%); and Miniature Poodle (1.68\%). A predominance of females with glaucoma occurred in the American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Chow Chow, English Cocker Spaniel, Samoyed, and perhaps the Siberian Husky, and a predominance of males in the Australian Cattle dog and St Bernard. Age affected the time for first presentation of the glaucomas in the pure-bred dog. In the majority of breeds the glaucomas were presented for initial diagnosis in dogs between 4 and 10 years of age.
Conclusion Breed-related glaucomas in pure-bred dogs are frequently presented to the veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America. The prevalence of the breed-related glaucomas in the dog appears similar to humans, and in some breeds exceeds that in humans. In many breeds the high prevalence of the glaucomas suggests a genetic basis.},

Design-Retrospective study.
Animals-80 dogs with severe otitis externa that required total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy.
Procedure-Medical records were reviewed for breed, sex, and age at time of surgery. Histologic specimens from the horizontal ear canal were evaluated by a single examiner for overall tissue response pattern and scored for sebaceous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland ectasia, fibrosis, pigment-laden macrophages, and osseous metaplasia.
Results-48 of 80 (60\%) dogs were Cocker Spaniels. Thirty-five of 48 (72.9\%) Cocker Spaniels had a predominately ceruminous tissue response pattern; only 9 of 32 (28.1 \%) dogs of other breeds had the same pattern. Other breeds most commonly had a pattern dominated by fibrosis (n = 13 [40.6\%]); fibrosis was the predominant pattern in only 4 of 48 (8.3\%) Cocker Spaniels. Discriminant analysis and K-means clustering of 4 histopathologic criteria correctly classified 75\% of the dogs as Cocker Spaniels or all other breeds.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Cocker Spaniels are at increased risk for chronic severe otitis externa requiring total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy, indicating that earlier and more aggressive management of the primary otitis externa and secondary inflammation is warranted in this breed. Cocker Spaniels with chronic severe otitis externa have distinct differences in pathologic characteristics of the horizontal ear canal, compared with other breeds.},

	abstract = {Standardised histological criteria are now available for the diagnosis of canine chronic hepatitis (CH). CH is common in dogs, but no studies have reported breed, age and gender distributions in the United Kingdom (UK). The objective of this study was to determine which breeds had an increased risk for developing CH in the UK and to report the age and gender distribution for those breeds. The databases of six veterinary histopathology laboratories were searched for cases with a histological diagnosis of CH according to standardised criteria. The breed, age and gender of dogs was recorded and compared to a control population to calculate the odds ratio and 95\% confidence intervals for developing CH.
A total of 551 cases of CH were identified, consisting of 61 breeds. Nineteen breeds were represented by five or more cases. Breeds with an increased risk for developing CH included the American cocker spaniel, Cairn terrier, Dalmatian, Dobermann pinscher, English cocker spaniel, English springer spaniel, Great Dane, Labrador retriever and Samoyed. The median age at diagnosis for all breeds with CH was 8 years (range 7 months to 16 years). Dalmatians, Dobermann pinschers and English springer spaniels with CH were significantly younger than Cairn terriers, English cocker spaniels and Labrador retrievers with CH. Females were over-represented when all cases were examined together. In conclusion, several breeds in the UK have an increased risk of CH, some of which have not been previously reported.

Of 2860 working dogs, 13.5 per cent sustained at least one tail injury during the 2010/2011 shooting season. Undocked spaniels and hunt point retrievers (HPRs) were at greatest risk of tail injury with 56.6 per cent of undocked spaniels and 38.5 per cent of undocked HPRs sustaining at least one tail injury during the season. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of tail injury in dogs with tails docked by one-third, half or shorter. To prevent one tail injury in one shooting season, between two and 18 spaniels or HPRs would need to be docked as puppies. The authors believe that this work provides the best available evidence on which to base a consultation for changes to the legislation on tail docking in working dogs in Scotland. Docking the tails of HPRs and spaniels by one-third would significantly decrease the risk of tail injury sustained while working in these breeds.},

Chemotaxis and random migration in affected and heterozygous dogs were found to be comparable to those of control dogs.  Increased (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) neutrophil adhesion, antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, iodination of proteins, and oxygen radical production in neutrophils from affected dogs were probably the result of chronic bacterial infection in vivo.  Bacterial ingestion by neutrophils from the three heterozygous English Springer Spaniel dogs was significantly increased compared to control dogs but was not different from affected English Springer Spaniel dogs, suggesting a breed-related phenomenon.  Significant decreases in neutrophil function were not seen in any of the dogs with congenital ciliary dyskinesia, indicating that a defective microtubular system is not shared by respiratory cilia and neutrophils and that defective neutrophil function does not contribute to respiratory infection.},

	abstract = {A number of dog breeds suffer from welfare problems due to extreme phenotypes and high levels of inherited diseases but the popularity of such breeds is not declining. Using a survey of owners of two popular breeds with extreme physical features (French Bulldog and Chihuahua), one with a high load of inherited diseases not directly related to conformation (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), and one representing the same size range but without extreme conformation and with the same level of disease as the overall dog population (Cairn Terrier), we investigated this seeming paradox. We examined planning and motivational factors behind acquisition of the dogs, and whether levels of experienced health and behavior problems were associated with the quality of the owner-dog relationship and the intention to reprocure a dog of the same breed. Owners of each of the four breeds (750/breed) were randomly drawn from a nationwide Danish dog registry and invited to participate. Of these, 911 responded, giving a final sample of 846. There were clear differences between owners of the four breeds with respect to degree of planning prior to purchase, with owners of Chihuahuas exhibiting less. Motivations behind choice of dog were also different. Health and other breed attributes were more important to owners of Cairn Terriers, whereas the dog's personality was reported to be more important for owners of French Bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels but less important for Chihuahua owners. Higher levels of health and behavior problems were positively associated with a closer owner-dog relationship for owners of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Chihuahuas but, for owners of French Bulldogs, high levels of problems were negatively associated with an intention to procure the same breed again. In light of these findings, it appears less paradoxical that people continue to buy dogs with welfare problems.},

For this, the technique of 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was standardized in 10 animals of each referred breeds. QRS complexes were more frequent in Cocker Spaniel than in Doberman and Boxer dogs. Ventricular premature beats were more common in Boxer dogs than in the other two breeds; however, all of then presented less than 1\% of supraventricular ectopic beats in relation to the total of beatings. Cocker Spaniel dogs manifested the highest minimum, average and maximum heart rates and remained with heart rates equal or greater than 120bpm longer than Doberman and Boxer dogs otherwise, Cocker Spaniel dogs remained more time than dogs of the other two breeds with heart rate equal or lower than 50bpm. Cocker Spaniel dogs demonstrated, besides less frequently, shorter pauses than Doberman and Boxer dogs did. It was concluded that: a) clinically normal dogs of the studied breeds showed an evident variation of the heart rate; b) the isolate ectopic supraventricular and ventricular contraction were less than 50 during a 24-hour period of monitorization; c) in Boxer dogs, the number of isolated ectopic ventricular beats was less than 50 during a period of 24 hours; d) the periods of assistolia or pauses bigger than two seconds were frequent in Boxer and Doberman dogs and absent in Cocker Spaniel dogs; e) these pauses were commonly greater than three seconds; f) alterations of ST segment were not observed in clinically normal dogs of the three breeds studied.},

	abstract = {Background: Sebaceous adenitis ( SA) is an uncommon, immune mediated skin disease in dogs. The aim was to retrospectively investigate SA in dogs in Sweden with respect to breed, sex and age distribution. A second aim was to retrospectively compare clinical signs in dogs with generalized SA and to estimate the survival after diagnosis in the English springer spaniel, standard poodle and the akita.
Methods: In total 34 Swedish veterinarians contributed with 104 clinically and histologically verified SA cases. Breed, gender and age at diagnosis were registered for each case. The degree of clinical signs at time for diagnosis and at follow-up and information about treatments, concurrent diseases and euthanasia were recorded for the springer spaniels, standard poodles and akitas using a standardized questionnaire.
Results: A total of 104 cases of SA were included; most cases were recorded for the springer spaniel ( n = 25), standard poodle ( n = 21) and the akita ( n = 10). These three breeds, together with the lhasa apso and the chow-chow, were the most common when national registry data from the Swedish Board of Agriculture and Swedish Kennel Club were considered. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years. The proportion of males was 61\%. When the springer spaniels, standard poodles and the akitas with generalized signs were compared ( n = 51), the spaniels showed significantly more severe clinical signs than the poodles at diagnosis regarding alopecia, seborrhoea, pyoderma and the overall severity of clinical signs. At follow-up, the degree of clinical signs for otitis externa and pyoderma differed significantly between the breeds. The estimated median survival time was 42 months.
In dogs where data regarding survival was available at the end of the study ( n = 44), SA was reported to be the reason for euthanasia in 14 dogs, whereof 7 within 24 months after diagnosis.
Conclusion: The result of this study implicates that the English springer spaniel is a breed predisposed to SA and that it has more severe clinical signs than the standard poodle. A large proportion of the dogs ( spaniel, poodle and akita) investigated regarding survival were reported to have been euthanized to great extent due to the disease.},

	abstract = {White coat patterning is a feature of many dog breeds and is known to be coded primarily by the gene micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). This patterning in the coat can be modified by other factors to produce the attractive phenotypes termed 'ticked' and 'roan' that describe the presence of flecks of color that vary in distribution and intensity within otherwise 'clear' white markings. The appearance of the pigment in the white patterning caused by ticking and roaning intensifies in the weeks after birth. We applied genome-wide association to compare English Cocker Spaniels of roan phenotype (N = 34) with parti-color (non-roan) English Cocker Spaniels (N = 9) and identified an associated locus on CFA 38, CFA38:11 057 040 (P-raw = 8.9 x 10(-10), P-genome = 2.7 x 10(-5)). A local case-control association in English Springer Spaniels comparing 11 ticked and six clear dogs identified indicative association with a different haplotype, CFA38:11 122 467G{\textgreater}T (P-raw = 1.7 x 10(-5)) and CFA38:11 124 294A{\textgreater}C (P-raw = 1.7 x 10(-5)). We characterize three haplotypes in Spaniels according to their putative functional variant profiles at CFA38:11 111 286C{\textgreater}T (missense), CFA38:11 131 841-11 143 239DUP.insTTAA (using strongly linked marker CFA38:11 143 243C{\textgreater}T) and CFA38:11 156 425T{\textgreater}C (splice site). In Spaniels, the haplotypes work as an allelic series including alleles (t, recessive clear; T, dominant ticked/parti-color; and T-R, incomplete dominant roan) to control the appearance of pigmented spots or flecks in otherwise white areas of the canine coat. In Spaniels the associated haplotypes are t (CCT), T (TCC) and T-R (TTT) for SNP markers on CFA38 at 11 111 286C{\textgreater}T, 11 143 243C{\textgreater}T and 11 156 425T{\textgreater}C respectively. It is likely that other alleles exist in this series and together the haplotypes result in a complex range of patterning that is only visible when dogs have white patterning resulting from the epistatic gene Micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (the S-locus).},

	abstract = {The onset of fear-related avoidance behavior occurs during and, to some extent, defines the sensitive period of development in the domestic dog. The objectives of this study were to identify the onset of fear-related avoidance behavior and examine breed differences in this behavioral development. A total of 98 purebred puppies representing 3 breeds were tested, namely Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n = 33), Yorkshire terriers (n = 32), and German shepherd dogs (n = 33). Data were collected weekly beginning 4-5 weeks after birth until 10 weeks of age. Puppies took part in 4 tests during each visit: a novel item, seesaw, step, and loud noise test. During each test, the presence or absence of fear-related avoidance behavior and crouched posture were noted. Saliva was also collected to measure salivary cortisol concentrations in the puppies before and after testing. A later onset of fear-related avoidance behavior was observed in Cavalier King Charles spaniels compared with German shepherd dog and Yorkshire terrier puppies (F = 11.78, N = 29, P {\textless} 0.001). The proportion of treatment puppies that exhibited fear in response to the testing was also different (X-2 = 9.81, N = 56, P = 0.007): Yorkshire terriers (N = 14, 78\%), Cavalier King Charles spaniel (N = 10, 53\%), and German shepherd dogs (N = 5, 26\%). Cortisol concentrations decreased with age. Cavalier King Charles spaniel puppies that demonstrated fear-related avoidance behavior exhibited a greater (t = 2.133, N = 79, P = 0.036) cortisol response than puppies that did not exhibit the behavior. Breed differences in the crouch response to the loud noise test, regardless of age, were observed (F = 18.26, N = 98, P {\textless} 0.001). Cavalier King Charles spaniels demonstrated the highest incidence of crouching followed by the Yorkshire Terriers. Breed differences in puppy mobility were observed beginning at 6 weeks of age, with German shepherd dogs demonstrating the most mobility and Cavalier King Charles spaniels the least. The results of this study support the hypothesis that emotional and behavioral development, as well as the onset of fear-related avoidance behavior, varies among breeds of domestic dogs.

Sample population Six hundred sixty-five dogs Methods A web-based survey seeking owner information as to the longevity of their dogs' working life and why they were retired, euthanised or died. Results The median age at which Springer spaniels stopped work was 11 years and for Cocker spaniels, it was 9 years. The median age for Labrador retrievers was 10 years; for Golden retrievers, 11 years and Flat-coated retrievers, 9.5 years. Cocker spaniels stopped work at a significantly younger age than Springer spaniels (p = 0.0003) or Labrador retrievers (p = 0.0407). There was no significant difference between the other major breeds. The majority of owners (54.3\%) were satisfied with the working lifespan of their dog. Seventy per cent of dogs were retired, the three most prevalent reasons being lameness (25.2\%), old age (23.7\%) and deafness (7.8\%). Forty-four dogs died (6.6\%) and 158 (24\%) were euthanised, with cancer (58\%) being the most common reason. Conclusions: No work-related issues were identified and gundogs appear to have similar causes of mortality to the general canine population.},

Materials and Methods Retrospective study of dogs under 12 months of age that were presented with humeral condylar fracture to three specialist referral centres between 2015 and 2018. Data retrieved from medical records included breed, age, gender, neuter status, affected limb, fracture configuration and aetiology of the fracture. Breed population percentages were compared with those recorded by the UK Kennel Club.
Results Of the 115 dogs with 118 fractures, French bulldogs (41\%) and English springer spaniels (15\%) were overrepresented: humeral condylar fractures were more commonly diagnosed in French bulldogs (odds ratio = 5.86) and English springer spaniels (odds ratio = 5.66) compared with mixed-breed dogs. Lateral condylar fractures occurred in 70\% of cases, with medial condylar fractures and Y/T fractures accounting for 9\% and 21\%, respectively. Median age at the time of fracture was 4 months (range 2 to 10 months).

	abstract = {Hereditary xanthinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by missense and loss of function variants in the xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) or molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) genes. The aim of this study was to uncover variants underlying risk for xanthinuria in dogs. Affected dogs included two Manchester Terriers, three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, an English Cocker Spaniel, a Dachshund, and a mixed-breed dog. Four putative causal variants were discovered: an XDH c.654G {\textgreater} A splice site variant that results in skipping of exon 8 (mixed-breed dog), a MOCOS c.232G {\textgreater} T splice site variant that results in skipping of exon 2 (Manchester Terriers), a MOCOS p.Leu46Pro missense variant (Dachshund), and a MOCOS p.Ala128Glyfs*30 frameshift variant that results in a premature stop codon (Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and English Cocker Spaniel). The two splice site variants suggest that the regions skipped are critical to the respective enzyme function, though protein misfolding is an alternative theory for loss of function. The MOCOS p.Leu46Pro variant has not been previously reported in human or other animal cases and provides novel data supporting this residue as critical to MOCOS function. All variants were present in the homozygous state in affected dogs, indicating an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Allele frequencies of these variants in breed-specific populations ranged from 0 to 0.18. In conclusion, multiple diverse variants appear to be responsible for hereditary xanthinuria in dogs.},

METHODS: A retrospective study of 229 cases was carried out.
RESULTS: There were 44 breeds in the study, with four breeds, English cocker spaniels, cavalier King Charles spaniels, West Highland white terriers and shih-tzus, making up 58 per cent of the cases. Among these four breeds, two breed-dependent disease patterns, one chronic and one acute, were identified. English cocker spaniels and West Highland white terriers had a mean age at onset of clinical signs of five years and one month and five years and six months, respectively, with more females affected than males. Clinical signs consisted predominantly of conjunctival hyperaemia and mucopurulent discharge, with a relatively low incidence of ulcerative keratitis. In contrast, cavalier King Charles spaniels and shih-tzus showed a more acute disease pattern with a biphasic age distribution at 0 to less than two years of age, and four to less than six and six to less than eight years of age, respectively, with more males affected than females and a significantly higher incidence of ulcerative keratitis in some cases resulting in corneal perforation.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study reveals interbreed differences with respect to sex, age and risk of ulcerative keratitis which have not been detailed previously in a referral population.},

	abstract = {The gene responsible for testis induction in normal male mammals is the Y-linked Sry. However, there is increasing evidence that other genes may have testis-determining properties. In XX sex reversal (XXSR), testis tissue develops in the absence of the Y chromosome. Previous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays indicated that autosomal recessive XXSR in the American cocker spaniel is Sry-negative. In this study, genomic DNA from the breeding colony of American cocker spaniels and from privately owned purebred dogs were tested by PCR using canine primers for the Sry HMG box and by Southern blots probed with the complete canine Sry coding sequence. Sry was not detected by either method in genomic DNA of affected American cocker spaniels or in the majority (20/21) of affected privately owned purebred dogs. These results confirm that the autosomal recessive form of XXSR in the American cocker spaniel is Sry-negative. In combination with previous studies, this indicates that Sly-negative XXSR occurs in at least 15 dog breeds. The canine disorder may be genetically heterogeneous, potentially with a different mutation in each breed, and may provide several models for human Sry-negative XXSR. A comparative approach to sex determination should be informative in defining the genetic and cellular mechanisms that are common to all mammals. Mel. Reprod. Dev. 53:266-273, 1999.

Increased serum creatine kinase activity and hyperkalemia also were sometimes present over the 4-year period of evaluation. Progressively increasing serum concentrations of N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide suggested cardiac disease. Erythrocytes from the whippets were less osmotically fragile but more alkaline fragile than those from control dogs. Erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (PFK) activities and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations were decreased. Restriction enzyme-based DNA test screening and DNA sequencing revealed the same mutation in the muscle-PFK gene of the Whippets as seen in English Springer Spaniel dogs with PFK deficiency.

Archived head CT scans for the above dog breeds were retrieved and a single observer measured tympanic bulla shape (width: height ratio), wall thickness, position relative to the temporomandibular joint, and relative volume (volume: body weight ratio). A total of 127 dogs were sampled. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels had significantly flatter tympanic bullae (greater width: height ratios) versus Pugs, English Bulldogs, Labrador retrievers, and Jack Russell terriers. French Bulldogs and Pugs had significantly more overlap between tympanic bullae and temporomandibular joints versus other breeds. All brachycephalic breeds had significantly lower tympanic bulla volume: weight ratios versus Labrador retrievers. Soft tissue attenuating material (middle ear effusion) was present in the middle ear of 48/100 (48\%) of brachycephalic breeds, but no significant association was found between tympanic bulla CT measurements and presence of this material.

	abstract = {Canine hypoadrenocorticism is an endocrine disorder characterised by inadequate secretion of steroid hormones from the adrenal glands. Pathology results from immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex, which is similar to that seen in the human Addison's disease. Both the canine and human diseases have similar clinical presentation, with the diagnosis based on performing a dynamic adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. MHC class II has previously been associated with the human and canine diseases. In the current study, we conducted an MHC class II association study in eight breeds of dog with diagnoses of hypoadrenocorticism. We demonstrated significant differences in dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) haplotype frequencies in six of these breeds: Cocker spaniel, Springer spaniel, Labrador, West Highland white terrier (WHWT), Bearded collie, and Standard poodle. In the Springer spaniel, the DLA-DRB1*015:01--DQA1*006:01--DQB1*023:01 haplotype was significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 5.14) and showed a similar trend in the Cocker spaniel. This haplotype is related to one associated with hypoadrenocorticism in the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever. Similar haplotypes shared between breeds were demonstrated, with DLA-DRB1*001:01--DQA1*001:01--DQB1*002:01 more prevalent in both affected Labrador (p = 0.0002, OR = 3.06) and WHWT (p = 0.01, OR = 2.11). Other haplotypes that have not previously been associated with the disease were identified. The inter-breed differences in DLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to canine hypoadrenocorticism could represent divergent aetiologies. This could have implications for clinical diagnosis and future comparative studies. Alternatively, it may suggest that the gene of interest is closely linked to the MHC.},

	abstract = {Hereditary muscle-type phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency causing intermittent hemolytic anemia and exertional myopathy due to a single nonsense mutation in PFKM has been previously described in English Springer and American Cocker Spaniels, Whippets, and mixed breed dogs. We report here on a new missense mutation associated with PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds.
Coding regions of the PFKM gene were amplified from genomic DNA and/or cDNA reverse-transcribed from RNA of EDTA blood of PFK-deficient and clinically healthy Wachtelhunds and control dogs. The amplicons were sequenced and compared to the published canine PFKM sequence. A point mutation (c.550C{\textgreater}T, in the coding sequence of PFKM expressed in blood) was found in all 4 affected Wachtelhunds. This missense mutation results in an amino acid substitution of arginine (Arg) to tryptophan (Trp) at position 184 of the protein expressed in blood (p.Arg184Trp). The mutation is located within an alpha-helix, and based on the SIFT analysis, this amino acid substitution is not tolerated. Amplifying the region around this mutation and digesting the PCR fragment with the restriction enzyme MspI, produces fragments that readily differentiate between PFK-deficient, carrier, and normal animals. Furthermore, we document 2 additional upstream PFKM exons expressed in canine testis but not in blood.
Despite their similar phenotypic appearance and use for hunting. Wachtelhunds and English Springer Spaniels are not thought to have common ancestors. Thus, it is not surprising that different mutations are responsible for PFK deficiency in these breeds. Knowledge of the molecular basis of PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds provides an opportunity to screen and control the spread of this deleterious trait. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since malicious activities are typically performed by combining multiple APIs, to identify the malicious intention, it is needed to inspect the series of APIs to analyze its semantics. In traditional malware analysis, this task generally relies on manual efforts of experts. There is no methodology for associating multiple APIs and identifying the malicious intention in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a virtual machine introspection-based method for automatically identifying high-level mechanisms. We developed Spaniel, a prototype system, which uses taint analysis to track malicious processing that derives from the data read from a specified file and collects the traces of malicious activities. For evaluation, we used adversary behavior models defined in ATT\&CK and Spaniel identified key indicators that cover 26\% of those models.},

	abstract = {Exercise intolerance syndromes are well known to be associated with inborn errors of metabolism affecting glycolysis (phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase deficiency) and fatty acid oxidation (palmitoyl carnitine transferase deficiency). We have identified a canine model for profound exercise intolerance caused by a deficit in PDP1 (EC 3.1.3.43), the phosphatase enzyme that activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc). The Clumber spaniel breed was originated in 1760 by the Due de Noailles, as a hunting dog with a gentle temperament suitable for the 'elderly gentleman'. Here we report that 20\% of the current Clumber and Sussex spaniel population are carriers for a null mutation in PDP1, and that homozygosity produces severe exercise intolerance. Human pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency was recently characterized at the molecular level. However, the nature of the human mutation (loss of a single amino acid altering PDP1 activity) made it impossible to discern the role of the second phosphatase isoform, PDP2, in the deficient phenotype. Here we show that the null mutation in dogs provides a valuable animal model with which to study the effects of dysregulation of the PDHc. Knowledge of the molecular defect has allowed for the institution of a rapid restriction enzyme test for the canine mutation that will allow for selective breeding and has led to a suggested dietary therapy for affected dogs that has proven to be beneficial. Pharmacological and genetic therapies for PDP1 deficiency can now be investigated and the role of PDP2 can be fully characterized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives Periodontal disease is a frequent diagnosis of dogs and can have severe negative impacts on welfare. It was hypothesised that breeds with skull shapes that differ most in conformation from the moderate mesocephalic skull shape have higher odds of periodontal disease. Materials and Methods The cohort study included a random sample of dogs under primary veterinary care in 2016 from the VetCompass Programme database. Risk factor analysis used random effects multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results The study included a random sample of 22,333 dogs. The 1-year period prevalence for diagnosis with periodontal disease was 12.52\% (95\% CI: 12.09 to 12.97). Eighteen breeds showed increased odds compared with crossbred dogs. Breeds with the highest odds included Toy Poodle (odds ratio 3.97, 95\% confidence intervals 2.21 to 7.13), King Charles Spaniel (odds ratio 2.63, 95\% confidence interval 1.50 to 4.61), Greyhound (odds ratio 2.58, 95\% confidence interval 1.75 to 3.80) and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (odds ratio 2.39, 95\% confidence interval 1.85 to 3.09). Four breeds showed reduced odds compared with crossbreds. Brachycephalic breeds had 1.25 times the odds (95\% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.42) of periodontal disease compared with mesocephalic breeds. Spaniel types had 1.63 times the odds (95\% confidence interval 1.42 to 1.87) compared with non-spaniel types. Increasing adult bodyweight was associated with progressively decreasing odds of periodontal disease. Clinical Significance The high prevalence identified in this study highlights periodontal disease as a priority welfare concern for predisposed breeds. Veterinarians can use this information to promote improved dental care in predisposed dogs, especially as these dogs age.},

The study population included all dogs within the VetCompass Programme (September 1, 2009-June 13, 2014). Overall, the period prevalence of symptomatic CM/SM was 0.05 per cent (95 per cent CI 0.04 per cent to 0.06 per cent) for all breeds. The period prevalence in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) was 1.6 per cent (95 per cent CI 1.2 to 2.06). Other breeds at increased odds included the King Charles Spaniel (KCS), Affenpinscher, Chihuahua and Pomeranian. Insured dogs had 4.6 times the odds (95 per cent CI 2.95 to 7.17) of having a diagnosis of CM/SM compared with uninsured dogs. Pain was the most commonly associated clinical sign (67 dogs, 72 per cent). Analgesics were prescribed to 72 (77.4 per cent) of the symptomatic dogs. Despite its low overall period prevalence, the high proportion of affected dogs identified with chronic pain suggests a significant welfare issue. Financial implications could impede the diagnostic process and lead to underestimation of the true prevalence. This study may help to inform clinicians about the clinical relevance and the need for improved awareness of clinical signs, particularly in high-risk breeds, to optimise the management of CM/SM in primary-care practice.},

The main difference between Group 2 (nonaffected elbows, n = 6) and Group 3 (contralaterals to IOHC or to condylar fracture, without fissure, n = 10) was the appearance of the humeral condyle in short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences: all elbows in Group 2 had a homogeneous humeral condyle, whereas all but one in Group 3 were heterogeneous. One dog in Group 3 developed a complete condylar fissure 7 months after the first examination, when no evidence of an intracondylar defect had been detected. The MRappearance of IOHC is variable and a heterogeneous humeral condyle in STIR images without a clear defect may warn of the possibility for the subsequent development of a condylar fissure.},

Severe, persistent reticulocytosis in light of only mild anemia together with hemoglobinuria after strenuous exercise suggested PFK deficiency. Low erythrocyte PFK activity together with low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations and a high hemoglobin-oxygen affinity confirmed the diagnosis. The PFK deficiency is due to a single missense mutation in the muscle-type PFK M-PFK gene in English springer and American cocker spaniels, whippets, and mixed-breed dogs; however, these PFK-deficient Wachtelhunds do not have the same PFK mutation.

The study population included all dogs that had visited one of 16 veterinary practices located in Scotland between 2002 and early 2012. The overall prevalence of tail injuries in dogs visiting one of the 16 veterinary practices was 0.59 per cent. The prevalence of tail injuries in dogs of working breeds was estimated to be 0.90 per cent. Working dog breeds that were examined by a veterinary surgeon were at a significantly greater risk of sustaining a tail injury than non-working breeds (P{\textless}0.001). To prevent one such tail injury in these working breeds approximately 232 dogs would need to be docked as puppies. To prevent one tail amputation in spaniels, 320 spaniel puppies would need to be docked. Spaniels presented after January 2009 were 2.3 times more likely to have a tail injury than those presented before April 29, 2007 (date of the legislation that banned tail docking in Scotland). Given the results of this and the accompanying paper it may be appropriate to consider changes to the current legislation for specific breeds of working dogs.},

All dogs were unmedicated and had no other diseases. The PRA was high in the dogs with mitral valvular insufficiency (median 3.44 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 2.59 to 8.66 ng/mL/h) compared with the controls (median 2.51 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 1.44 to 3.58 ng/mL/h).

However, there was considerable overlap between the 2 groups in both PRA and PAC. It was concluded from these data that there is early activation of the renin-angiotensin system in some Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with mitral valvular insufficiency.

	abstract = {Introduction Dog breeds are a consequence of artificial selection for specific attributes. These closed genetic populations have metabolic and physiological characteristics that may be revealed by metabolomic analysis.
Objectives To identify and characterise the drivers of metabolic differences in the fasted plasma metabolome and then determine metabolites differentiating breeds.
Methods Fasted plasma samples were collected from dogs maintained under two environmental conditions (controlled and client-owned at home). The former (n = 33) consisted of three breeds (Labrador Retriever, Cocker Spaniel and Miniature Schnauzer) fed a single diet batch, the latter (n = 96), client-owned dogs consisted of 9 breeds (Beagle, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, Dachshund, Golden Retriever, Greyhound, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Maltese) consuming various diets under differing feeding regimens. Triplicate samples were taken from Beagle (n = 10) and Labrador Retriever (n = 9) over 3 months. Non-targeted metabolite fingerprinting was performed using flow infusion electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry which was coupled with multivariate data analysis. Metadata factors including age, gender, sexual status, weight, diet and breed were investigated.
Results Breed differences were identified in the plasma metabolome of dogs housed in a controlled environment. Triplicate samples from two breeds identified intra-individual variability, yet breed separation was still observed. The main drivers of variance in dogs maintained in the home environment were associated with breed and gender. Furthermore, metabolite signals were identified that discriminated between Labrador Retriever and Cocker Spaniels in both environments.
Conclusion Metabolite fingerprinting of plasma samples can be used to investigate breed differences in client-owned dogs, despite added variance of diet, sexual status and environment.},

Five times more ticks were found on cocker spaniels (498) than on beagles (96). Substances were collected by rubbing pieces of clean flannel on the dogs for 15 min and these were tested for arrestment and attractiveness of ticks. Three choices were offered: cocker extract vs. control; beagle extract vs. control, and cocker extract vs. beagle extract. When allowed to choose between substances rubbed from dogs and a control, more ticks were arrested by extracts from the cockers than from beagles. In the arrestment tests with only a choice between substances from dogs of each breed, more ticks were arrested by cocker substances. To test for attraction, capsules containing adsorbent were used and the tests were carried out in a Y-olfactometer. Fifteen males and 15 females were tested, for each treatment. In the olfactometer, the ticks were not attracted to the odor of either breed, however the odor of the Beagle was apparently repellent. These results indicate that R. sanguineus can use substances from the dogs to differentiate susceptible English Cocker Spaniels from resistant Beagles.},

The age of the dogs ranged from 3 months to 14 years (median: 4.75 years) and they included 45 males and 55 females. Cocker spaniels, Jura des Alpes and Brittany spaniels were significantly overrepresented among dogs with OE when compared to the hospital canine population. In the majority of the cases, OE was chronic-recurrent (63\%) or bilateral (93\%). Allergic dermatitis (43/100 dogs), grass awns (12/100) and otoacariasis (7/100) were the most common primary causative factors; no primary factor could be incriminated in 32 cases and more than one was found in three dogs. Malassezia spp. (66/100 dogs), cocci (38/100) and rods (22/100) were the secondary causative factors, while ear canal stenosis (38/100) and tympanic membrane perforation-otitis media (25/100) were the most important perpetuating factors. Atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions-associated OE was more common in females and dogs with a history of pruritic skin disease, while grass awn-induced OE occurred in cocker spaniels and acute cases. Tympanic membrane perforation was less frequent in atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions-associated OE, but more common when otoscopic and ear canal cytological examination revealed the presence of grass awns and rods, respectively. Finally, cocci overgrowth was positively associated with ear canal stenosis.},

	abstract = {DMRT1, which encodes a zinc finger-like DNA binding motif, is a well-conserved gene that is involved in testis differentiation in a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. The objective of this study was to determine whether a DMRT1 microsatellite marker allele is associated with the affected phenotype in a pedigree of canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal generated from an American Cocker spaniel founder.
Ten affected dogs and their parents and grandparents were genotyped. Four alleles at this locus and five different genotypes were found in this pedigree. All affected dogs inherited this trait from the foundation sire of this colony. Thus, the disease-causing mutation should be identical by descent in all affected dogs. Six affected dogs were found to have genotypes at this locus that were different from those of the founder sire. These results indicate that DMRT1 is an unlikely candidate gene for SRY-negative XX sex reversal in this model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, when fed on the beagle breed of dog, Canis lupus familiaris, development negatively affected in comparison with tick development after feeding on the English cocker spaniel breed. Thus leading to the suggestion that beagle dogs are be tick-resistant dogs. Behavioural studies have demonstrated that more ticks are attracted by extracts from cocker spaniels than from beagles and that the odour of beagles is a repellent. To test the hypothesis that resistant hosts produce repellent compounds, we undertook comparative chemical analysis on beagle odour and cocker spaniel extracts using coupled high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and also used Petri-dish and olfactometer behavioural assays to assess the response of ticks to identified non-host compounds. The beagle odour extracts contained almost three times as many chemical compounds as cocker spaniel samples. Several non-host compounds were identified, i.e. 2-hexanone, benzaldehyde, nonane, decane and undecane. In Petri-dish assays, 2-hexanone was repellent at 30 min at concentrations of 0.200 and 0.050 mg cm(-2), whilst at 10 min, the 0.100 mg cm(-2) concentration was repellent. Benzaldehyde repelled ticks at 30 min (0.200 mg cm(-2)) and at 5 min (0.050 mg cm(-2)). Undecane was repellent for R. sanguineus s.l. ticks for the first 5 min at the highest concentration tested. Nonane and decane did not show any significant repellency at any concentration or time evaluated. When 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde were combined, an increase in the repellency rate was observed, with activity comparable or better than N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET). In olfactometer bioassays, a 1:1 mixture of 2-hexanone:benzaldehyde and DEET were repellent for R. sanguineus s.l. adults at the concentration of 0.200 mg cm(-2). This study identified non-host semiochemicals that mediate avoidance of the beagle dog breed by R. sanguineus s.l. This finding may enable development of new approaches to control this tick.

The mean (sd) plasma alpha-tocopherol concentration in the normal dogs was 20.2 (7.1) mug/ml, compared with 1-14 (0-67) mug/ml in the 11 affected cocker spaniels. The difference between the two groups remained highly significant when the alpha-tocopherol concentrations were expressed relative to the concentrations of the plasma lipids cholesterol and triglycerides. Low plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol were observed in the four affected dogs of other breeds, but the finding was not so consistent. The plasma lipid concentrations were normal in the affected dogs. The deficiency of alpha-tocopherol in the affected dogs appeared to be primary, because there was no clinical, biochemical or pathological evidence of underlying disease, or any indication of a dietary deficiency which might have contributed to the low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol.},

	abstract = {Data from two population-based studies in four Norwegian counties were used to calculate the crude incidence of mammary tumours, and the age- and breed-specific incidence of mammary tumours in female dogs of three different breeds. The largest study comprised 14401 histologically verified tumour cases from four counties covered by the Norwegian Canine Cancer Register. The registry covers about 25\% of the total Norwegian dog population The second study was a census in Norway that was sent to all owners of the following breeds: boxers, bichon frise and Bernese mountain dogs, to estimate the age distribution of the female dog population at risk of developing mammary tumours. The crude incidence of malignant mammary tumours in female dogs of any breed was 53.3\%. The highest relative risk ratio of mammary tumours was found in boxers, cocker spaniels, English springer spaniels and dachshunds. The mean age of histologically diagnosed mammary tumours was 7.9 years in boxers and 7.8 years in springer spaniels, compared with 8.8 pears in all other breeds. In the four Norwegian counties from 1992 to 1997, the population-based incidence rates (for all ages) of malignant mammary tumours per 1000 female dogs per year were 35,47 in boxers, 3,87 in Bernese mountain dogs and 17.69 in bichon frise. Mammary cancer is the most common tumour in female dogs in Norway and represents a population of almost entirely reproductively intact females. The age-specific incidence rates for mammary cancer vary considerably among the three breeds that were studied in detail.},

Design-Retrospective case series.
Animals-172 dogs (290 eyes) that underwent phacoemulsification surgery for cataract removal. Procedure-Medical records were reviewed for postoperative complications; prevalence rates for each complication were calculated for follow-up periods of 3 months, {\textgreater} 3 to 6 months, {\textgreater} 6 months to 1 year, {\textgreater} 1 to 2 years, {\textgreater} 2 to 3 years, {\textgreater} 3 to 4 years, and {\textgreater} 4 years. Odds ratios for breed, age, sex, cataract hyper-maturity, lens-induced uveitis, and diabetes mellitus were determined with respect to glaucoma and failure (ie, blindness, enucleation, or evisceration).
Results-The most common complication was mild posterior capsule opacification. Retinal detachment was uncommon (1\% to 2\%) for all time periods. Prevalence of glaucoma increased with time, although it remained {\textless} 10\% until after the 1-year follow-up period. Boston Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Cocker Spaniel-Poodle crosses, and ShihTzus had increased risk of developing glaucoma. Eyes with hypermature cataracts were more likely to develop glaucoma. Prevalence of failure increased with time, although it remained {\textless} 10\% until after the 3-year follow-up period. Cocker Spaniel-Poodle cross and ShihTzus were more likely to have failure.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Evaluation of breed and cataract hypermaturity may aid in the selection of patients. The increasing prevalence of postoperative complications with time indicated that long-term monitoring is warranted.},

Hypothesis/objectives To determine cytological and bacteriological features of middle ear effusions in dogs, provide information on histological features, and further assess the dog as a model of the human disease.
Animals Sixteen live dogs, 3 postmortem cases of middle ear effusion, and 2 postmortem controls.
Methods Prospective; clinical investigation using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, video-otoscopy, myringotomy; cytological assessment of 30 and bacteriology of 28 effusions; histology and immunohistochemistry (CD3 for T-lymphocytes, Pax5 for B lymphocytes and MAC387 for macrophages) of 10 middle ear sections.
Results Effusions were associated with neurological deficits in 6/16 (38\%) and concurrent atopic dermatitis and otitis externa in 9/16 (56\%) of live cases. Neutrophils and macrophages predominated on cytology (median 60 [range 2\%-95.5\%] and 27 [2\%-96.5\%]) whether culture of effusions was positive or not. In histology sections, the mucosa was thickened in affected dogs but submucosal gland dilatation occurred in affected and unaffected dogs. There was no bacterial growth from 22/28 (79\%) of effusions. Bacteria isolated from the other 6 (21\%) were predominantly Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (4/6, 67\%).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance Clinical, morphological, and cytological findings in middle ear effusions of dogs and people suggest similar pathogeneses. Middle ear effusion of dogs could be a useful model of human otitis media with effusion. Such comparisons can improve understanding and management across species.},

Animals studied Primary corneal endothelial degeneration was diagnosed in 238 dogs between 1998 and 2017. Corneal ulceration associated with PCED was present in 89 dogs (109 eyes), of which 47 eyes were treated with SK. Procedures A retrospective assessment of medical records was performed to determine the signalment patterns of PCED, and the success rate of the SK procedure for resolving PCED-associated corneal ulceration. Descriptive statistics were reported on the signalment of PCED cases, with odd ratios and confidence intervals calculated to detect breed predispositions. Results Primary corneal endothelial degeneration was diagnosed in 238 dogs, 40.8\% were female and 59.2\% were male, with a mean age at diagnosis of 11.4 years. Dachshunds, Dalmatians, English Springer Spaniels, Welsh Springer Spaniels, Chihuahuas, Cocker Spaniels, and Golden Retrievers were significantly over-represented. All PCED-affected Dalmatians developed associated corneal ulceration. Follow-up information was available for 41/47 eyes treated with SK. At the first reassessment, 87.8\% were healed which increased to 97.6\% with subsequent monitoring. Four eyes (9.8\%) had late corneal ulcer occurrence following SK, at a median time following SK of 182 weeks post-surgery. Conclusions Superficial keratectomy was an effective option for resolving painful non-healing corneal ulcers associated with PCED. Dalmatians may be at increased risk of developing PCED-associated corneal ulceration.},

Ultrasonography demonstrated that both masses were cystic structures markedly larger in size than the normal contralateral globes. In both cases, surgical excision revealed a multilobular cyst filling the whole orbital cavity. Histopathologic examination and immunostaining for glial fibrillary acid protein and S100 protein supported a diagnosis of neural cysts associated with ocular dysplasia. The definitive diagnosis was congenital cystic eye and microphthalmos with cyst for the Cocker Spaniel and miniature poodle, respectively. Karyotype was normal in both dogs. Congenital cystic eye and microphthalmos with cyst result from defects in early embryonic life that arise following formation of the optic vesicle and prior to closure of the optic fissure.

The highest genetic diversity was exhibited by the Tibetan Mastiff, indicating useful protection and little inbreeding in the modem Tibetan Mastiff. Higher genetic diversity was observed in European breeds, supporting the hypotheses that breeders outcross their pure breed dogs occasionally to avoid deleterious effects in Europe. Evolutionary relationships showed that English Springer Spaniel and Labrador Retriever were clustered together, then with the Tibetan Mastiff, consistent with previous cluster results.

	abstract = {Canine aggression poses serious public health and animal welfare concerns. Most of what is understood about breed differences in aggression comes from reports based on bite statistics, behavior clinic caseloads, and experts' opinions. Information on breed-specific aggressiveness derived from such Sources may be misleading due to biases attributable to a disproportionate risk of injury associated with larger and/or more physically powerful breeds and the existence of breed stereotypes. The present study surveyed the owners of more than 30 breeds of dogs using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), a validated and reliable instrument for assessing dogs' typical and recent responses to it variety of common stimuli and situations. Two independent data samples (a random sample of breed club members and an online sample) yielded significant differences among breeds in aggression directed toward strangers, owners and dogs (Kruskal-Wallis tests, P {\textless} 0.0001).
Eight breeds common to both datasets (Dachshund, English Springer Spaniel, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Poodle, Rottweiler, Shetland Sheepdog and Siberian Husky) ranked similarly, r(s) = 0.723. P {\textless} 0.05; r(s) = 0.929, P {\textless} 0.001; r(s) = 0.592, P = 0.123, for aggression directed toward strangers, dogs and owners, respectively. Some breeds scored higher than average for aggression directed toward both humans and dogs (e.g., Chihuahuas and Dachshunds) while other breeds scored high only for specific targets (e.g., dog-directed aggression among Akitas and Pit Bull Terriers). In general, aggression was most severe when directed toward other dogs followed by unfamiliar people and household members. Breeds with the greatest percentage of dogs exhibiting serious aggression (bites or bite attempts) toward humans included Dachshunds, Chihuahuas and Jack Russell Terriers (toward strangers and owners); Australian Cattle Dogs (toward strangers); and American Cocker Spaniels and Beagles (toward owners). More than 20\% of Akitas. Jack Russell Terriers and Pit Bull Terriers were reported as displaying serious aggression toward unfamiliar dogs. Golden Retrievers, Labradors Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Brittany Spaniels, Greyhounds and Whippets were the least aggressive toward both humans and dogs. Among English Springer Spaniels, conformation-bred dogs were more aggressive to humans and dogs than field-bred dogs (stranger aggression: Mann-Whitney U test, z = 3.880, P {\textless} 0.0001; owner aggression: 2.110, P {\textless} 0.05; dog-directed aggression: z = 1.93, P = 0.054), suggesting a genetic influence on the behavior. The opposite pattern was observed for owner-directed aggression among Labrador Retrievers, (z = 2.18, P {\textless} 0.05) indicating that higher levels of aggression are not attributable to breeding for show per se.

	abstract = {Objectives To estimate the frequency and breed-related risk factors for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in dogs under UK primary veterinary care.
Methods Analysis of cohort electronic patient record data through the VetCompass Programme. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic regression.
Results There were 1456 KCS cases overall from 363,898 dogs [prevalence 0.40\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.42] and 430 incident cases during 2013 (1-year incidence risk 0.12\%, 95\% CI 0.11-0.13). Compared with crossbreds, breeds with the highest odds ratio (aOR) for KCS included American cocker spaniel (aOR 52.33: 95\% CI 30.65-89.37), English bulldog (aOR 37.95: 95\% CI 26.54-54.28), pug (aOR 22.09: 95\% CI 15.15-32.2) and Lhasa apso (aOR 21.58: 95\% CI 16.29-28.57). Conversely, Labrador retrievers (aOR 0.23: 95\% CI 0.1-0.52) and border collie (aOR 0.30: 95\% CI 0.11-0.82) had reduced odds. Brachycephalic dogs had 3.63 (95\% CI 3.24-4.07) times odds compared to mesocephalics. Spaniels had 3.03 (95\% CI 2.69-3.40) times odds compared to non-spaniels. Dogs weighing at or above the mean bodyweight for breed/sex had 1.25 (95\% CI 1.12-1.39) times odds compared to body weights below. Advancing age was strongly associated with increased odds.
Clinical significance Quantitative tear tests are recommended within yearly health examinations for breeds with evidence of predisposition to KCS and might also be considered in the future within eye testing for breeding in predisposed breeds. Breed predisposition to KCS suggests that breeding strategies could aim to reduce extremes of facial conformation.},

Dog professionals' opinions of the various breeds on many behavior traits reveal factors such as reactivity, aggression, ease of training and immaturity. Heritability of various behaviors - hunting ability, playfulness, and aggression to people and other dogs - has been calculated. The neurotransmitters believed to be involved in aggression are discussed. The gene for aggression remains elusive, but identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breed-specific behavior traits are leading us in the right direction. The unique syndrome of aggression found in English Springer Spaniels may be a model for detecting the gene involved.},

Individuals of these four breeds varied significantly on 5 out of 30 characteristics, as rated by their handlers, namely; tendency to be distracted when searching, agility, motivation to obtain food, independence, and stamina. English Springer Spaniels and Border Collies scored significantly closer to ideal levels than did Labrador Retrievers and cross breeds, for several of these characteristics. Overall satisfaction with the handler's own dog(s) did not differ between the four most common breeds and was also unaffected by the dog's sex. However, males and females did differ in their ratings for one characteristic; males were rated higher than females, which were rated closer to the ideal, for aggression towards other dogs. Overall, there appeared to be little difference between the sexes in their suitability for search work. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The precise pathophysiology of SM is still not fully understood. The most common predisposing cause in dogs is a Chiari-like malformation (CM). This disease is defined as a developmental failure of the occipital bone leading to overcrowding of the caudal cranial fossa. Abnormally small bony structures contain rhomencephalon structures (cerebellum and medulla oblongata) which are unchanged in size. This "mismatch" causes caudal displacement of encephalon structures via the foramen magnum, altering the cerebrospinal fluid flow. CM is thought to be associated with a higher grade of brachycephaly. The SM/CM complex is very common in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) breed.},

Hypothesis/Objectives Describe the prevalence, presentation, clinical management, and outcomes of VD in dogs under primary veterinary care at UK practices participating in VetCompass. Animals Seven hundred and fifty-nine vestibular cases identified out of 905 544 study dogs. Methods Retrospective cohort study. Potential VD cases clinically examined during 2016 were verified by reviewing clinical records for signalment, presenting clinical signs, treatments, and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with VD. Results The overall prevalence of VD was 8 per 10 000 dogs (95\% CI = 7-9). Median age at first diagnosis was 12.68 years (interquartile range [IQR], 11.28-14.64). Compared with crossbreeds, breeds with the highest odds of VD diagnosis included French Bulldogs (odds ratio [OR] = 9.25, 95\% CI = 4.81-17.76,P {\textless} .001), Bulldogs (OR = 6.53, 95\% CI = 2.66-16.15,P {\textless} .001), King Charles Spaniels (OR = 4.96, 95\% CI = 2.52-9.78,P {\textless} .001), Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (OR = 3.56, 95\% CI = 2.50-5.06,P {\textless} .001), and Springer Spaniels (OR = 3.37, 95\% CI = 2.52-4.52,P {\textless} .001). The most common presenting signs were head tilt (69.8\%), nystagmus (68.1\%), and ataxia (64.5\%). The most frequently used treatments were antiemetics (43.2\%), systemic glucocorticoids (33.1\%), antimicrobials (25\%), and propentofylline (23.25\%). There were 3.6\% of cases referred. Improvement was recorded in 41.8\% cases after a median of 4 days (IQR, 2-10.25). Conclusions Our study identifies strong breed predispositions for VD. The low referral rates suggest that primary-care data sources offer more generalizable information for benchmarking to help clinicians review their own clinical activities.},

	abstract = {A comparative histopathologic study of 50 cases of pemphigus foliaceus and 47 cases of superficial folliculitis in the dog was undertaken to identify those histopathologic features important in differentiating these diseases. All cases were diagnosed by the Surgical Pathology Service of the Laboratory of Pathology of the University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine, between January 1986 and March 1991. These cases were followed clinically to determine the accuracy of the initial histopathologic diagnosis. Data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test for discrete data and the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous data. A probability of {\textless}0.05 was considered statistically significant. The following breeds were affected with pemphigus foliaceus: Akita, Brittany Spaniel, Chow Chow, Collie, Dachshund, Doberman Pinscher, English Cocker Spaniel, English Setter, Golden Retriever, Siberian Husky, Laborador Retriever, Miniature Schnauzer, Old English Sheepdog, Scottish Terrier, Chinese Shar Pei, Spitz, Shetland Sheep Dog, Weimeraner, and West Highland White Terrier. An increased risk of developing pemphigus foliaceus was noted in the Akita (OR = 37.8), English Springer Spaniel (OR = 20.7), Chow Chow (OR = 12.3), Chinese Shar Pei (OR = 7.9), and Collie (OR = 3.9). Pemphigus foliaceus had a higher average density of acantholytic cells (226 +/- 22.9) than superficial folliculitis(11.8 +/- 4.6), and acantholytic cells were 183 times more likely to be present in pemphigus foliaceus. The presence of rafts of acantholytic cells occurred in pemphigus foliaceus (23/50) more often than superficial folliculitis (1/47). Recornification and reformation of pustules were, respectively, 13.4 and 3.6 times more likely to occur in pemphigus foliaceus. Finally, a longer pustule that bridges multiple hair follicles (2.3 +/- 0.20 mm and 1.31 +/- 0.10 mm, respectively) was seen in pemphigus foliaceus.},

	abstract = {Objective
Medical records of eight dogs presenting with acute onset of neurological signs and a diagnosis of brain infarction as determined by computed tomography (CT) imaging were reviewed.
Design
Retrospective single-centre case review
Results
Ischaemic infarction in the territory of the rostral cerebellar artery was identified in three spaniel-breed dogs. All cerebellar infarcts were non-haemorrhagic. Telencephalic infarcts were identified in five dogs, in the territories of the middle cerebral artery (2/5) and rostral cerebral artery (3/5). One of these dogs had an ischaemic infarction, but all other infarctions appeared haemorrhagic. All dogs were geriatric ({\textgreater}= 8 years old), with concurrent medical conditions identified in six dogs. One dog was euthanased after diagnosis because of the severity of its neurological signs and one dog was euthanased as a result of associated renal disease 2 months after diagnosis. Six dogs were alive at least 1 year after diagnosis.
Conclusions
CT is useful in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident in dogs, which can present as a spectrum of images with early changes in attenuation and subtle mass effects detected after infarction. CT is particularly sensitive for detecting haemorrhagic infarction, but under-represent ischaemic and lacunar infarctions when compared with MRI.},

Materials and MethodsRetrospective review of radiographs or ultrasound images of dogs showing branching mineralisation in the liver.
ResultsOver the 30-year review period, 17 cases were identified and the mineralisation had a predominantly ventral distribution. Seven of the 17 were cavalier King Charles spaniels, and four of the total 17 dogs were diagnosed with hepatobiliary system disease. Five dogs had repeat radiographs, of which four showed no change in the pattern and one developed the pattern 6 years after being diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis. Serum calcium concentrations were normal in all patients. Liver enzymes were markedly elevated only in the dog diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis. Histology performed on three patients showed no convincing evidence of primary liver disease.
Clinical SignificanceBranching mineralisation in the liver parenchyma is a rare finding in dogs with little or no clinical significance and cavalier King Charles spaniels may be predisposed. Biopsy of the liver of affected dogs with no clinical or clinicopathological evidence of liver disease is unlikely to be helpful in these cases.},

Methods A retrospective review of the Comparative Ocular Pathology Laboratory of Wisconsin database revealed 153 canine evisceration or enucleation submissions that met inclusion criteria. The most commonly represented breeds were identified, and enucleated globes of these breeds were further evaluated histologically (n = 69). Following standard hematoxylin \& eosin staining, globes were evaluated for the presence of; corneal pathology, goniodysgenesis, pigment dispersion, pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes (PIFVMs), peripheral anterior, and/or posterior synechiation, inflammatory infiltrates, lens pathology, retinal pathology, and/or endophthalmitis.
Results The most significantly represented breeds were the Cocker Spaniel (11.7\%), Boston Terrier (10.5\%), Labrador Retriever (6.5\%), Bichon Frise (6.5\%), Shih Tzu (5.8\%), and Jack Russell Terrier (5.8\%). Common histopathologic findings included inflammatory keratitis, the presence of PIFVMs, and lymphoplasmacytic uveal infiltrates.
Conclusions The Cocker Spaniel, Boston Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Bichon Frise, Shih Tzu, and Jack Russell Terrier may be at increased risk of the development of glaucoma following elective cataract surgery. These findings have potential clinical implications.},

METHODS: Three sections of pancreas were taken from 200 unselected canine post-mortem examinations from first-opinion practices. Sections were graded for inflammation, fibrosis and other lesions. Prevalence and relative risks of chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic diseases were calculated.
RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis was 34 per cent omitting the autolysed cases. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, collies and boxers had increased relative risks of chronic pancreatitis; cocker spaniels had an increased relative risks of acute and chronic pancreatitis combined. Fifty-seven per cent of cases of chronic pancreatitis were classified histologically as moderate or marked. Forty-one per cent of cases involved all three sections. Dogs with chronic pancreatitis were more commonly female and overweight, but neither factor increased the relative risk of chronic pancreatitis. There were breed differences in histological appearances and 24.5 per cent of cases were too autolysed to interpret with an increased relative risk of autolysis in a number of large breeds.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic pancreatitis Is a common, underestimated disease in the first-opinion dog population with distinctive breed risks and histological appearances.},

Procedure-Blood type, breed, and sex distribution of dogs with IMHA were compared with data for control dogs with Fisher exact tests and by calculating odds ratios (ORs). Results of bacterial culture of blood samples were documented for dogs with IMHA, when available.
Results-Dog erythrocyte antigen 7 was associated with a significant protective effect (OR, 0.1) in Cocker Spaniels with IMHA (n = 10), compared with control dogs. Cocker Spaniels, Bichon Frise, Miniature Pinschers, Rough-coated Collies, and Finnish Spitz had a significantly increased risk of IMHA, as did female dogs (OR, 2.1).

	abstract = {Background The objectives of this study were to establish the prevalence, risk factors and comorbidities/sequelae for diabetes mellitus (DM) in Australian dogs presented to first-opinion veterinary practices.
Methods Electronic patient records of dogs (n=134,329) attending 152 veterinary clinics during 2017 were sourced through VetCompass Australia. They included 418 dogs with DM; a prevalence of 0.36 per cent (95 per cent CI 0.33 per cent to 0.39 per cent) in Australian dogs attending these veterinary clinics. By comparing with the reference group of rarer breeds and unidentified crossbreeds, multivariable modelling was used to reveal breeds (and their crosses) with significantly higher odds of having DM.
Results The results revealed that breeds (and their crosses) with significantly higher odds of having DM were Australian terriers (ORs=7.93 (95 per cent CI 2.83 to 22.27)), Siberian huskies (OR=6.24 (95 per cent CI 2.51 to 15.54)), English springer spaniels (OR=5.37 (95 per cent CI 1.48 to 19.53)), West Highland white terriers (OR=4.85 (95 per cent CI 2.55 to 9.25)), miniature schnauzers (OR=3.47 (95 per cent CI 1.16 to 10.35)), all types of poodles (OR=3.41 (95 per cent CI 2.07 to 5.61)), bichon frises (OR=3.41 (95 per cent CI 1.65 to 7.01)), schnauzers (OR=3.18 (95 per cent CI 1.42 to 7.11)) and cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS; OR=1.84 (95 per cent CI 1.08 to 3.13)). Breeds with lower risk were German shepherd dogs (OR=0.11 (95 per cent CI 0.01 to 0.84)), golden retrievers (OR=0.09 (95 per cent CI 0.01 to 0.68)) and boxers (no cases identified). Fisher's exact tests showed that labradoodles were diagnosed significantly more often than purebred Labradors (P=0.04) and did not differ significantly from poodles (P=0.81). Cavoodles did not differ significantly from either CKCS (p similar to 1.00) or poodles (P=0.12). Spoodles were significantly less diagnosed than poodles (P=0.003) but did not differ from cocker spaniels (P=0.66). Desexed male dogs had a higher odds of DM than entire male (OR=0.62 (95 per cent CI 0.39 to 0.98)) and desexed female dogs (OR=0.76 (95 per cent CI 0.61 to 0.96)). Comorbidities/sequelae associated with canine DM included suspected pancreatitis (OR 10.58 (95 per cent CI 5.17 to 22.78)), cataracts (OR 9.80 (95 per cent CI 5.65 to 17.35)), hyperadrenocorticism (OR 6.21 (95 per cent CI 3.29 to 11.88)), urinary tract infection (OR 5.09 (95 per cent CI 1.97 to 13.41)) and hypothyroidism (OR 4.10 (95 per cent CI 1.08 to 15.58)).
Conclusions Breeds at most risk included Australian terriers and Siberian huskies as previously reported, as well as, for the first time, English springer spaniels. In contrast to other populations where there is female predisposition for DM, desexed male dogs in Australia were at increased risk for DM compared with both entire males and desexed females. This predisposition for desexed males to develop DM warrants further investigation.},

Results: The shar-pei, German shepherd and cocker spaniel breeds were over-represented compared with the hospital's breed distribution (P {\textless} 0 center dot 001). German shepherd dogs and cocker spaniels were statistically more prone to infection with rod-shaped organisms and Labrador retrievers less than other breeds (P=0 center dot 034). Almost all dogs that were older than five years when diagnosed with OE had cocci (P=0 center dot 01) and also had higher levels of rods (P=0 center dot 028). The incidence of rods was higher in endocrinopathies (P=0 center dot 004), while that of Malassezia spp. tended to be higher in allergies (P=0 center dot 098). There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for all the other parameters examined.
Clinical Significance: OE infection is usually not influenced by primary causes or predisposing factors. Endocrinopathies may be followed by a more severe otitis, however. OE may be more severe when it affects older dogs.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To describe the presentation, influence of previous treatment and diagnosis in juvenile dogs presenting with pyrexia to a UK referral centre.
Materials and Methods : Clinical records of dogs aged 1 to 18 months presenting with a problem list including pyrexia ({\textgreater}= 39 center dot 2 degrees C) that was reproducible during referral hospitalisation were retrospectively reviewed. Signalment, history - including previous treatment, clinical examination findings and diagnosis were recorded. Diagnoses were categorised as non-infectious inflammatory, infectious, congenital, neoplastic and miscellaneous. The influence of previous treatment on the ability to reach a final diagnosis was analysed.
Results: A total of 140 cases was identified. Diagnosis was reached in 115 cases. Non-infectious inflammatory disease was identified in 91 cases (79\%), infectious disease in 19 cases (17\%), a congenital disorder in four dogs (3\%) and neoplasia in one dog (1\%). Breeds most commonly identified were Border collies (17/140; 12\%), beagles (16/140; 11\%), Labrador retrievers (11/140; 8\%), springer spaniels (9/140; 6\%) and cocker spaniels (8/140; 6\%). Before presentation, most dogs had received antibiotics (83/140; 59\%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (84/140; 60\%) or steroids (9/140; 6\%), either alone or in combination. Neither antibiotics nor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs influenced the ability to reach a diagnosis. Steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis comprised 55 of 91 (60\%) individuals of the non-infectious inflammatory cohort. All four dogs diagnosed with congenital disorders were Border collies.},

	abstract = {Insulin-deficiency diabetes in dogs shares some similarities with human latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). Canine diabetes is likely to have a complex pathogenesis with multiple genes contributing to overall susceptibility and/or disease progression. An association has previously been shown between canine diabetes and MHC class II genes, although other genes are also likely to contribute to the genetic risk. Potential diabetes susceptibility genes include immuno-regulatory TH1/TH2 cytokines such as IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-10. We screened these candidate genes for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)m a range of different dog breeds using dHPLC analysis and DNA sequencing. Thirty-eight of the SNPs were genotyped in crossbreed dogs and seven other breed groups (Labrador Retriever, West Highland White Terrier, Collie, Schnauzer, Cairn Terrier, Samoyed and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), which demonstrated substantial intra-breed differences in allele frequencies. When SNPs were examined for an association with diabetes by case:control analysis significant associations were observed for IL-4 in three breeds, the Collie, Cairn Terrier and Schnauzer and for IL-10 in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. These results suggest that canine cytokine genes regulating the TH1/TH2 immune balance might play a contributory role in determining susceptibility to diabetes in some breeds. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The scale was most accurate for the diagnosis of cardiac disease in the Yorkshire terrier and the cavalier King Charles spaniel, breeds affected by predominantly dilative forms of cardiac disease.

The purpose of the present study was to describe the morphologic and morphometric features of the TMJ in domestic dogs using CT. Width and depth of the mandibular fossa and 2 different angles between the mandibular fossa and the condylar process were measured in 96 TMJs of 48 dogs of different breeds (Labrador retriever, German shepherd, cocker spaniel, boxer, English bulldog, pug, shih tzu, and Cavalier King Charles spaniel). Temporomandibular joint conformation differed between breeds. Mid- and small-sized dogs had mandibular fossae that were more shallow, less developed retroarticular processes, and irregularly shaped condylar processes. The TMJs were more congruent in large dogs, presenting with deeper mandibular fossae, prominent retroarticular processes, and more uniform condylar processes.

Outcome is strongly determined by molecular subtype, reflecting a need for new and improved treatment options. Dogs spontaneously develop lymphoma, and the predisposition of certain breeds indicates genetic risk factors. Using the dog breed structure, we selected three lymphoma predisposed breeds developing primarily T-cell (boxer), primarily B-cell (cocker spaniel), and with equal distribution of B- and T-cell lymphoma (golden retriever), respectively. We investigated the somatic mutations in B- and T-cell lymphomas from these breeds by exome sequencing of tumor and normal pairs. Strong similarities were evident between B-cell lymphomas from golden retrievers and cocker spaniels, with recurrent mutations in TRAF3-MAP3K14 (28\% of all cases), FBXW7 (25\%), and POT1 (17\%). The FBXW7 mutations recurrently occur in a specific codon; the corresponding codon is recurrently mutated in human cancer. In contrast, T-cell lymphomas from the predisposed breeds, boxers and golden retrievers, show little overlap in their mutation pattern, sharing only one of their 15 most recurrently mutated genes. Boxers, which develop aggressive T-cell lymphomas, are typically mutated in the PTEN-mTOR pathway. T-cell lymphomas in golden retrievers are often less aggressive, and their tumors typically showed mutations in genes involved in cellular metabolism. We identify genes with known involvement in human lymphoma and leukemia, genes implicated in other human cancers, as well as novel genes that could allow new therapeutic options.},

	abstract = {Fucosidosis is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. The pathologic changes in brain which occur with progression from preclinical to late clinical disease were investigated in fucosidosis affected dogs. As aging also causes neurodegeneration and lysosomal dysfunction, pathologic markers of fucosidosis were compared to changes in the aging canine brain. Preclinical fucosidosis cerebral cortex and cerebellum revealed early increases in all neurodegenerative markers studied including apoptosis (2.1 fold), pyramidal neuronal loss (0.9 fold decrease) and Purkinje cell loss (1.2 fold decrease) compared to age matched controls. Increased axonal spheroid formation ({\textgreater}100 fold in cortex, 80 fold in cerebellum), microgliosis (9.2 fold) and astrocytosis (2.1 fold in cortex and 0.5 fold in cerebellum) were distinctive features of preclinical fucosidosis brain in all regions examined. This neuropathology progressed as the dogs developed severe clinical signs, with advanced fucosidosis brain exhibiting the greatest parenchymal destruction. These measures of the neurodegenerative and inflammatory changes in fucosidosis brain will assist monitoring disease progression and response to therapy.

Animals Three dog breeds - Golden Retrievers (n = 20), Siberian Huskies (n = 20) and English Cocker Spaniels (n = 36) - were studied.
Procedure IOPs were measured using a Tonopen following corneal anesthesia with a single drop of 0.5\% proxymetacaine. A drop of 0.5\% tropicamide was then administered bilaterally and a second IOP measurement was taken 30 min later (postdilation). The difference between the two measurements was considered as the effect of mydriasis on IOP.
Results Dogs had an average IOP of 14.9 +/- 3.2 mmHg, with 95\% confidence limits ranging from 8 to 22 mmHg. There were significant differences between breeds (P {\textless} 0.006) with Siberian Huskies having higher IOPs (17.2 +/- 3.7 mmHg) than the other breeds (Spaniels: 14.2 +/- 2.8 mmHg, P {\textless} 0.01; Retrievers: 14 +/- 1.9 mmHg, P {\textless} 0.001). The majority (60\%) of dogs displayed 5 mmHg or less in IOP change postmydriasis. Siberian Huskies showed the highest IOP levels, and also had the greatest variability with dilation.

	abstract = {BackgroundAn asymptomatic macrothrombocytopenia, phenotypically similar to asymptomatic inherited macrothrombocytopenia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, was described in a group of Norfolk Terriers (NT) from Northern Italy, and isolated cases were also reported in Cairn Terriers (CT).
ObjectivesThe purpose of this work was to evaluate for the presence of a genetic defect in the 1-tubulin gene in macrothrombocytopenic NT and CT.
MethodsSamples from 20 healthy dogs (13 NT and 7 CT) were collected at different institutions in Italy (n=8), United Kingdom (n=3), and United States (n=9). Genomic DNA was harvested from EDTA-anticoagulated blood and all coding areas and exon-intron splice sites in the gene encoding 1-tubulin were amplified and sequenced.
ResultsTwelve dogs (9 NT and 3 CT) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 1 at nucleotide position 5 (G5A) that would result in the change of an arginine to a histidine at amino acid position 2 (R2H). Four dogs (3 NT and one Cairn Terrier) were heterozygous for the SNP, and 4 dogs (one Norfolk Terrier and 3 CT) matched the normal canine genome. Homozygous dogs for the SNP were macrothrombocytopenic with platelet counts ranging from 19,000 to 110,000/L. Heterozygous and normal dogs had normal platelet counts and morphology. None had the CKCS point mutation.
ConclusionsThe 1-tubulin N-terminal amino acids form the nucleotide-binding domain and thus this mutation could affect GTP binding enough to influence platelet formation in homozygous but not in heterozygous dogs. The presence of macrothrombocytopenia only in homozygous affected dogs reveals an association between the SNP and the phenotype.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare the morphology of the uveoscleral (US) outflow pathway in normal and glaucomatous canines.
Animals studied 10 normal beagles, 10 beagles with inherited primary open-angle glaucoma, 4 cocker spaniels with spontaneous glaucoma. Procedures Formalin-preserved globes were sectioned tangentially and sagittally and treated with H\&E, Masson's trichrome, or elastin stains or analyzed by immunohistochemistry to visualize smooth muscle actin. Tissues associated with the US pathway were observed and compared using light microscopy.
Results Tangentially oriented sections clearly revealed spaces for the transport of aqueous humor at the junction of the posterior iridocorneal angle (ICA) and anterior ciliary body musculature (CBM). Within the external anterior-most of the US pathway, the supraciliary space, distinct connective tissue cords and smooth muscle pegs fastened the ciliary body to the adjacent sclera. Compared to normal controls, glaucomatous eyes developed a robust scleral elastic sheath at the junction between the posterior ICA and the anterior CBM. In advanced glaucomatous beagles and cocker spaniels, a large amount of melanophores were seen in the US pathway and surrounding vasculature. Within the C8M of glaucomatous specimens, the smooth muscle bundles appeared fewer and separated by elastic-rich ECM. Structures of the US pathway changed little with age.
Conclusions The anterior portion of the canine US pathway is well defined and appears to be altered little with age. However with glaucoma, changes of the US pathway were associated with its the elastic components, as well as the accumulation of melanophores. Collectively, these changes may have an effect on US outflow and, subsequently, aqueous humor dynamics.},

Of 466 MR studies reviewed, an increased signal was identified in the tympanic bulla in 32 (7\%) dogs. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Cocker spaniels, Bulldogs, and Boxers were over-represented compared to the population of dogs having MR imaging. Five (16\%) dogs had definite otitis media and one (3\%) had a meningioma invading the middle ear. Of the remaining dogs, 13 (41\%) had possible otitis media and 13 (41\%) had neurologic conditions apparently unrelated to otitis media. The most common appearance of material in the middle ear was isointense in T1-weighted images and hyperintense in T2-weighted images. There was no apparent correlation between the signal characteristics of the material and the diagnosis. Enhanced signal after gadolinium administration was observed affecting the lining of the bulla in dogs with otitis media and in dogs with unrelated neurologic conditions. In dogs without clinical signs of otitis media, finding an increased signal in the middle ear during MR imaging may reflect subclinical otitis media or fluid accumulation unrelated to inflammation. Brachycephatic dogs may be predisposed to this condition.},

PECOE is pruritic and bilateral. NPECOE is often bilateral, is pruritic or painful, and is hyperplastic. SOE is unilateral in 50\% of the cases and is painful and ulcerative. Cytological examination shows mainly Malassezia, sometimes associated with cocci in NPECOE, and shows cocci and/or rods in SOE. Bacteriological examination reveals mainly staphylococci in NPECOE and mainly Pseudomonas and staphylococci in SOE.

METHODS: The medical records of 13 dogs diagnosed with aortic thromboembolism as the cause of the clinical signs, and where a complete neurological examination was performed, were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The onset was acute in only four dogs, chronic in five dogs (with all of these presenting as exercise intolerance) or chronic with acute deterioration in four dogs. Dogs with an acute onset of clinical signs were more severely affected exhibiting neurological deficits, while dogs with a chronic onset of disease predominantly presented with the exercise intolerance and minimal deficits. The locomotor deficits included exercise intolerance with pelvic limb weakness (five of 13), pelvic limb ataxia (one of 13), monoparesis (two of 13), paraparesis (two of 13), non-ambulatory paraparesis (two of 13) and paraplegia (one of 13). There was an apparent male predisposition and the cavalier King charles spaniel was overrepresented.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The rate of onset of clinical signs appears to segregate dogs affected by aortic thromboembolism into two groups, with different clinical characteristics and outcomes. Dogs with an acute onset of the clinical signs tend to be more severely affected, while dogs with a chronic onset predominantly present with exercise intolerance. It is therefore important to consider aortic thromboembolism as a differential diagnosis in dogs with an acute onset of pelvic limb neurological deficits and in dogs with longer standing exercise intolerance.},

Fine mapping with additional microsatellites in the region containing CPH9 localized the Sry-negative XX sex reversal locus to a 5.4-Mb candidate region between markers CPH9 and FH3003 (LOD score 3.15). Insignificant LOD scores were found at genome-wide screen or fine mapping markers that were within 10 Mb of 45 potential candidate genes reported to have a role in mammalian sex determination or differentiation.

In addition, in 109 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (of which 61 were included in the three substudies mentioned above), the relation between femoral artery pulse strength and presence of thrombocytopenia was investigated. In 26\% of the dogs, a pulse less than or equal to 50\% of normal strength was detected; six dogs (2.0\%) had an absent pulse unilaterally or bilaterally. Mitral valve prolapse severity, degree of obesity, heart rate and age all influenced femoral artery pulse strength negatively. Weak femoral artery pulses were not related to clinical signs or to decreased pulse pressure or stroke volume. A weak femoral artery pulse reflected reduced artery diameter and/or distension rather than occlusion. In conclusion, weak femoral artery pulses in dogs with MMVD seem to be associated with regional/local reductions in blood flow and not arteriosclerosis or platelet count. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A similar syndrome has been described in English Springer Spaniel littermates with an early onset of anemia, megaesophagus, generalized muscle atrophy and cardiomyopathy. Muscle histopathology in both breeds showed distinctive pathological changes consistent with congenital polymyopathy. Using whole genome sequencing and mapping to the CanFam4 (Canis lupus familiaris reference assembly 4), a nonsense variant in the EHBP1L1 gene was identified in a homozygous form in the Labrador Retriever littermates. The mutation produces a premature stop codon that deletes approximately 90\% of the protein. This variant was not present in the English Springer Spaniels. Currently, EHPB1L1 is described as critical to actin cytoskeletal organization and apical-directed transport in polarized epithelial cells, and through connections with Rab8 and a BIN1-dynamin complex generates membrane vesicles in the endocytic recycling compartment. Furthermore, EHBP1L1 knockout mice die early and develop severe anemia. The connection of EHBP1L1 to BIN1 and DMN2 functions is particularly interesting due to BIN1 and DMN2 mutations being causative in forms of centronuclear myopathy. This report, along with an independent study conducted by another group, are the first reports of an association of EHBP1L1 mutations with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and polymyopathy.},

We have examined the opsin gene for polymorphisms in several breeds of pedigree dog suffering from distinct forms of gPRA, by methods including single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, microsatellite analysis and direct sequencing. The breeds examined included the Tibetan terrier, the miniature schnauzer, the Irish setter, the miniature poodle, the Labrador retriever and the English cocker spaniel, as well as individuals from breeds in which PRA has not been described and of mixed breed. Individuals from each of the named breeds suffering from PRA were compared with clinically normal dogs. Two polymorphisms were found. One, segregating within the Tibetan terrier population, but not seen in other breeds, was a synonymous transition at nucleotide position 780 in exon 3. Inheritance of this polymorphism suggests that opsin is unlikely to contain mutations causative of gPRA in this breed. The other polymorphism occurred between all miniature schnauzers examined and dogs of other breeds. It consisted of a single base insertion in intron 2. No polymorphisms in the opsin sequence were detected in any other breed. DNA sequencing allowed rigorous exclusion of mutations in opsin as a cause of gPRA in miniature poodles, English cocker spaniels or Labrador retrievers.},

	volume = {201},
	abstract = {During a 5-year period, phacolytic uveitis was diagnosed in 202 eyes of 151 dogs admitted to the veterinary teaching hospital. The diagnosis of phacolytic uveitis was based on the finding of a cataractous lens and anterior uveitis, unassociated with other identifiable causes of uveal inflammation. The most commonly affected breeds were the Toy and Miniature Poodle (35\%) and the American Cocker Spaniel (19\%). The mean age was 7.0 years for all breeds, 5.1 years for the Cocker Spaniel, and 9.0 years for the Poodle breeds. Evidence of cataract resorption was visible in 72\% of the eyes. Fifty-one dogs were affected bilaterally and 100 dogs unilaterally. The mean interval between recognition of the cataract and the onset of lens-induced uveitis (LIU) was 17 months; mean times of 25 and 11 months were seen in the Poodle breeds and American Cocker Spaniel, respectively. The mean age of dogs requiring {\textgreater} 1 revisit before the inflammation had subsided was 5.5 years. Complications, referable to the uveitis, were seen in 14\% of eyes, the most important of which were glaucoma (16 eyes) and phthisis bulbi (9 eyes). Lens extraction surgery was done on 50 LIU-affected eyes, and on 35 normal eyes in LIU-affected animals. The 2- and 6-month success rates for LIU-affected eyes were 78 and 39\%, respectively, and for normal eyes in LIU-affected animals were 85 and 71\%, respectively.
On the basis of findings, we suggest that LIU develops sooner after the onset of cataract formation in young dogs, and implies that their response to medical treatment is worse when compared with that in older dogs. It is probable that higher concentrations of lenticular alpha-crystallin protein, along with faster cataract resorption in the lens of young dogs, account for this decreased responsiveness to anti-inflammatory treatment, because T-cell tolerance to alpha-crystallin is more easily terminated than to other lens proteins. The observation that normal eyes of LIU-affected dogs retained a good prognosis following lens extraction surgery suggests that local, rather than systemic, immune factors are of primary importance in the pathogenesis of canine LIU.},

Thirty breeds with at least 800 bitches insured each year were studied using univariate and multivariate methods. The crude 12-month risk of pyometra for females {\textless} 10 years of age was 2.0\% (95\% confidence interval = 1.9-2.1\%) in 1995 and 1.9\% (1.8-2.0\%) in 1996. The occurrence of pyometra differed with age, breed, and geographic location. The risk of developing pyometra was increased (identified using multivariate models) in rough Collies, Rottweilers, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Golden Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and English Cocker Spaniels compared with baseline (all other breeds, including mixed breed dogs). Breeds with a low risk of developing the disease were Drevers, German Shepherd Dogs, Miniature Dachshunds, Dachshunds (normal size), and Swedish Hounds. Survival rates indicate that on average 23-24\% of the bitches in the databases will have experienced pyometra by 16 years of age. In the studied breeds, this proportion ranged between 10 and 54\%. Pyometra is a clinically relevant problem in intact bitches, and differences related to breed and age should be taken into account in studies of this disease.},

It is rare in the overall dog population but shows a breed-related predisposition with Standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs having a greater prevalence of the condition. It shares many similarities with human primary adrenal insufficiency and is believed to be a naturally occurring, spontaneous model for the human condition. Short haplotype blocks and low levels of linkage disequilibrium in the human genome mean that the identification of genetic contributors to the condition requires large sample numbers. Pedigree dogs have high linkage disequilibrium and long haplotypes within a breed, increasing the potential of identifying novel genes that contribute to canine genetic disease. We investigated 222 SNPs from 42 genes that have been associated or may be implicated in human Addisons disease. We conducted casecontrol analyses in 3 pedigree dog breeds (Labrador retriever: affected n 30, unaffected 76; Cocker Spaniel: affected n 19, unaffected 53; Springer spaniel: affected n 26, unaffected 46) and identified 8 associated alleles in genes COL4A4, OSBPL9, CTLA4, PTPN22, and STXBP5 in 3 pedigree breeds. Association with immune response genes PTPN22 and CTLA4 in certain breeds suggests an underlying immunopathogenesis of the disease.

	abstract = {The cyclic guanosine monophosphate specific phosphodiesterase (cGMP-specific PDE) is a key enzyme in the phototransduction cascade of the vertebrate retina. This enzyme consists of two catalytic alpha and beta subunits, two identical inhibitory gamma subunits as well as a delta subunit. Mutations in PDE6A and the PDE6B genes lead to autosomal recessive (ar) forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in human and to the homologous disease in dogs, designated generalised progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA). We investigated the PDE6A gene in 13 gPRA-affected dog breeds including healthy animals, obligate gPRA carriers and gPRA-affected dogs. In the coding region of PDE6A only a rare sequence variation (G103A; Asp35Asn) was found in exon 1 of two healthy Tibet Terriers and one affected Cocker Spaniel. Using single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses we detected several sequence variations in eight of the PDE6A introns in different investigated breeds. Most informative for excluding the PDE6A gene as a cause for gPRA was a polymorphic microsatellite ((GT)(10)CG(GT)(2)CG(GT)(12)) in intron 14 and four sequence variations in intron 18 for almost all breeds investigated. The sequence variations of PDE6A did not segregate together with gPRA in 11 breeds. Since diseased animals were heterozygous for the polymorphisms, the PDE6A gene is unlikely to harbour the critical mutation causing gPRA in the following breeds: Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Entlebucher Sennenhund, Labrador Retriever, Tibet Mastiff, Dachshund (long-and wire-haired), Tibetan Terrier, Miniature Poodle, Australian Cattle Dog, Cocker Spaniel, Saarloos/Wolfshound, Sloughi.},

	abstract = {Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is one of the major causes of retinal photoreceptor cell degeneration in canines. The inheritance pattern of PRA is autosomal recessive and genetically heterogeneous. Here, using targeted sequencing technology, we have performed exome sequencing of 10 PRA-affected (Spitz = 7, Cocker Spaniel = 1, Lhasa Aphso = 1 and Spitz-Labrador cross breed = 1) and 6 normal (Spitz = 5, Cocker Spaniel = 1) dogs. The high-throughput sequencing using 454-Roche Titanium sequencer generated about 2.16 Giga bases of raw data. Initially, we have successfully identified 25,619 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed the stringent SNP calling parameters. Further, we performed association study on the cohort, and the highly significant (0.001) associations were short-listed and investigated in-depth. Out of the 171 significant SNPs, 113 were previously unreported. Interestingly, six among them were non-synonymous coding (NSC) SNPs, which includes CPPED1 A {\textgreater} G (p.M307V), PITRM1 T {\textgreater} G (p.S715A), APP G {\textgreater} A (p.T266M), RNF213 A {\textgreater} G (p.V1482A), C {\textgreater} A (p.V1456L), and SLC46A3 G {\textgreater} A (p.R168Q). On the other hand, 35 out of 113 unreported SNPs were falling in regulatory regions such as 3'-UTR, 5'-UTR, etc. In-depth bioinformatics analysis revealed that majority of NSC SNPs have damaging effect and alter protein stability. This study highlighted the genetic markers associated with PRA, which will help to develop genetic assay-based screening in effective breeding.},

	abstract = {Background: The clinical importance of dog allergy is well known, but it is unknown if all types of dogs represent the same risk for allergic patients. The purpose of this work was to evaluate among 288 healthy dogs if the levels of Can f 1 on fur vary between breeds (German Shepherd, Pyrenean Shepherd, Poodle, Cocker spaniel, Spaniel, Griffon, Labrador retriever and Yorkshire terrier), gender, hormonal status, hair length, and according to the presence of seborrhea.
Methods: Each dog was shaved in a limited area and Can f 1 concentrations were measured in mu g/g fur by ELISA. The results (geometric mean values and 95\% confidence intervals) were analyzed using analysis of variance and with nonparametric tests.
Results: A wide variability in Can f 1 levels was found between dog breeds, from Labradors [1.99 (0.03-129.91)] to Yorkshires [16.72 (3.67-76.16)] and Poodles [17.04 (2.79-103.94)] but only the Labrador levels were significantly different from each other breed. Males produced more Can f 1 than females, 11.75 (1.27-108.40) vs 8.89 (0.91-86.39). No difference was found according to hair length or hormonal status. The seborrheic status highly (P = 0.0019) influenced the presence of Can f 1 on hair: 16.66 (1.59-173.96) vs 9.40 (1.03-85.70).
Conclusion: Breeds (Labrador retriever), sex and seborrhea seem to influence the levels of Can f 1 on fur.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES : To investigate inter-examiner variability in gonioscopic evaluation of pectinate ligament abnormality in dogs and to assess level of inter-examiner agreement for four different gonioscopy grading schemes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Two examiners performed gonioscopy in 98 eyes of 49 Welsh springer spaniel dogs and estimated the percentage circumference of iridocorneal angle affected by pectinate ligament abnormality to the nearest 5\%. Percentage scores assigned to each eye by the two examiners were compared. Inter-examiner agreement was assessed following assignment of the percentage scores to each of four grading schemes by Cohen's kappa statistic.
RESULTS : There was a strong positive correlation between the results of the two examiners (R=0.91). In general, Examiner 1 scored individual eyes higher than Examiner 2, especially for eyes in which both examiners diagnosed pectinate ligament abnormality. A "good" level of agreement could only be achieved with a gonioscopy grading scheme of no more than three categories and with a relatively large intermediate bandwidth (kappa=0.68).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : A three-tiered grading scheme might represent an improvement on hereditary eye disease schemes which simply classify dogs to be either "affected" or "unaffected" for pectinate ligament abnormality. However, the large intermediate bandwidth of this scheme would only allow for the additional detection of those dogs with marked progression of pectinate ligament abnormality which would be considered most at risk of primary closed-angle glaucoma.},

	abstract = {Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease and cause of cardiac death in domestic dogs. MMVD is characterised by slow progressive myxomatous degeneration from the tips of the mitral valves onwards with subsequent mitral valve regurgitation, and left atrial and ventricular dilatation. Although the disease usually has a long asymptomatic period, in dogs with severe disease, mortality is typically secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure. Although it is not uncommon for dogs to survive long enough in the asymptomatic period to die from unrelated causes; a proportion of dogs rapidly advance into congestive heart failure. Heightened prevalence in certain breeds, such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, has indicated that MMVD is under a genetic influence. The genetic characterisation of the factors that underlie the difference in progression of disease is of strong interest to those concerned with dog longevity and welfare. Advanced genomic technologies have the potential to provide information that may impact treatment, prevalence, or severity of MMVD through the elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms and the detection of predisposing genetic loci of major effect. Here we describe briefly the clinical nature of the disorder and consider the physiological mechanisms that might impact its occurrence in the domestic dog. Using results from comparative genomics we suggest possible genetic approaches for identifying genetic risk factors within breeds. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed represents a robust resource for uncovering the genetic basis of MMVD.},

	abstract = {The relative function of the P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel, varies between humans due to polymorphisms in the P2RX7 gene. This study aimed to assess the functional impact of P2X7 variation in a random sample of the canine population. Blood and genomic DNA were obtained from 69 dogs selected as representatives of a cross section of different breeds. P2X7 function was determined by flow cytometric measurements of dye uptake and patch-clamp measurements of inward currents. P2X7 expression was determined by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Sequencing was used to identify P2RX7 gene polymorphisms. P2X7 was cloned from an English springer spaniel, and point mutations were introduced into this receptor by site-directed mutagenesis. The relative function of P2X7 on monocytes varied between individual dogs. The canine P2RX7 gene encoded four missense polymorphisms: F103L and P452S, found in heterozygous and homozygous dosage, and R270C and R365Q, found only in heterozygous dosage. Moreover, R270C and R365Q were associated with the cocker spaniel and Labrador retriever, respectively. F103L, R270C, and R365Q but not P452S corresponded to decreased P2X7 function in monocytes but did not explain the majority of differences in P2X7 function between dogs, indicating that other factors contribute to this variability. Heterologous expression of site-directed mutants of P2X7 in human embryonic kidney-293 cells indicated that the R270C mutant was nonfunctional, the F103L and R365Q mutants had partly reduced function, and the P452S mutant functioned normally. Taken together, these data highlight that a R270C polymorphism has major functional impact on canine P2X7.},

	abstract = {Purpose. Experimental models of human myopia have been developed using animals of various species. However, most of these are an induced rather than a spontaneous, naturally occurring myopia. This study was conducted to evaluate whether the spontaneous myopia found in three canine breeds was axial in nature and therefore similar to humans.
Methods. Refractive error was measured by cycloplegic retinoscopy and ocular components by A-scan ultrasound (ocular axial dimensions) and videophakometry (corneal and lens radii and powers) in 83 dogs of three breeds [English Springer Spaniels (n = 33), Toy Poodles (n = 36), and Collies (n = 14)]. Dogs with refractive errors equal to or more myopic than -0.5 diopters spherical equivalent were considered myopic.
Results. Myopia was most common in Toy Poodles (63.9\%), followed by English Springer Spaniels (36.4\%) and Collies (35.7\%). Axial lengths and vitreous chamber depths were not different between myopic and non-myopic dogs (p = 0.84 and 0.63, respectively). The anterior crystalline lens radius was steeper and the lens power was greater in myopic compared with non-myopic dogs (p = 0.048 for each).
Conclusions. Spontaneous myopia was very common in all three breeds in this sample of dogs, with Toy Poodles being most affected. However, the cause of the myopia appeared to be refractive, that is from a steeper, more powerful crystalline lens, rather than from excess axial elongation. These breeds do not appear to be promising models for human axial myopia. (Optom Vis Sci 2011; 88:269-274)},

Study design Retrospective nested cohort study.
Sample population One hundred twelve dogs.
Methods Medical records of dogs referred between January 2010 and August 2018 were searched for HCF. Demographics, fracture configuration, repair, and complications were obtained from medical records. Radiographs were assessed for fracture reduction, implant positioning, and bone healing. Short-term radiographic and clinical outcomes, and long-term owner-assessed outcome was determined. Associations between these variables were statistically analyzed.
Results Dogs with HCF represented 112 of 43 325 (0.26\%, 95\% CI 0.22-0.31) referrals. French bulldogs and spaniel breeds were predisposed to HCF (P {\textless} .02). French bulldogs were 6.58 times (95\% CI 1.62-26.7) more likely than other breeds to have a medial HCF (P = .008). Epicondylar plate fixation was associated with reduced complications compared with lag screws and Kirschner wires (P = .009). Lameness was scored as 1 of 5 (median) in the 85 dogs with initial follow-up (median 6 weeks) after HCF repair. Outcome was considered excellent in 26 of 31 dogs with long-term follow-up (median 36 months).
Conclusion French bulldogs and spaniels were predisposed to HCF, and medial HCF were more common in French bulldogs. Epicondylar plate fixation was associated with reduced complications.
Clinical significance French bulldogs are predisposed to HCF, including medial HCF. Epicondylar plate fixation is recommended over other epicondylar fixation methods to reduce complications.},

The study investigated gundogs that worked in the seasons 2005/2006 and 2006/2007. Information was acquired by owner questionnaires. The dogs were classified as working in the beating line, as peg dogs or as picking up dogs. A further group comprised Setters and Pointers that worked the grouse. moors. A secondary objective was to assess the incidence of injuries that were treated by owners without seeking the assistance of their veterinarian, and to identify those that may have been underestimated. Depending on whether a dog was injured or went lame, and, if so, the nature of the injury, was correlated with the number of days worked, where it worked, its breed and the type of work it did. A mildly positive association between the Spaniel breed group and injuries was seen in 2005/2006 but not in 2006-2007. However, the relationship between the type of work and injuries was very significant for both seasons with dogs working in the beating line being at greatest risk and Setters and Pointers having the least number of injuries. The dogs in the beating line were also at a significantly greater risk of injury in both years when the type of injury was investigated. Fifty-three percent of all injuries were deemed to be sufficiently minor, that veterinary attention was not sought. However, those dogs with proximal thoracic limb lameness may have been under-investigated. There was a highly significant association between tail injuries and undocked Springer and Cocker Spaniels.},

Results were compared with published studies emanating from the United Kingdom exploring effect of breed on HCF. Methods Data for all canine admissions to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Kansas State University were extracted for the period January 2010 to October 2020. Humeral fractures were recorded and further subclassified as medial, lateral and 'T'/'Y' condylar fractures. The associations between HCF and subtypes with breed were assessed using univariate logistic regression with a comparison group. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of breed while accounting for dog age, sex and neuter status. Results Of the 44,952 canine patients seen during the study period, period prevalence (95\% confidence interval [CI] for HCF was 0.26\% [0.22, 0.31]). After adjustment for age and neuter status, French Bulldogs were 49 times more likely to be diagnosed with a HCF compared with the comparison breed group (odds ratio [OR], 49.0; 95\% CI, 26.9-89.3). After adjustment for age and neuter status, Cocker Spaniels (OR, 42.8; 95\% CI, 16.8-108.6), Boston Terriers (OR, 22.9; 95\% CI, 11.0-47.9) and Brittany Spaniels (OR, 21.5; 95\% CI, 7.3-63.1) had the next highest increase in HCF compared with the comparison group.

	abstract = {Background: The prevalence for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in dogs varies widely (0.05-3.74\%). Identified risk factors include advancing age, specific breeds, small body size, and periodontal disease.
Hypothesis/Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and identify risk factors associated with CKD diagnosis and survival in dogs. Purebred dogs were hypothesized to have higher CKD risk and poorer survival characteristics than crossbred dogs.
Animals: A merged clinical database of 107,214 dogs attending 89 UK veterinary practices over a 2-year period (January 2010-December 2011).
Methods: A longitudinal study design estimated the apparent prevalence (AP) whereas the true prevalence (TP) was estimated using Bayesian analysis. A nested case-control study design evaluated risk factors. Survival analysis used the Kaplan-Meier survival curve method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling.
Results: The CKD AP was 0.21\% (95\% CI: 0.19-0.24\%) and TP was 0.37\% (95\% posterior credibility interval 0.02-1.44\%). Significant risk factors included increasing age, being insured, and certain breeds (Cocker Spaniel, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel). Cardiac disease was a significant comorbid disorder. Significant clinical signs included halitosis, weight loss, polyuria/polydipsia, urinary incontinence, vomiting, decreased appetite, lethargy, and diarrhea. The median survival time from diagnosis was 226 days (95\% CI 112-326 days). International Renal Interest Society stage and blood urea nitrogen concentration at diagnosis were significantly associated with hazard of death due to CKD.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Chronic kidney disease compromises dog welfare. Increased awareness of CKD risk factors and association of blood biochemistry results with survival time should facilitate diagnosis and optimize case management to improve animal survival and welfare.},

Urinary screening tests are based upon the binding of GAG to dimethylmethylene blue. Alternatively, paper spot tests using toluidine blue are used in human and veterinary laboratory medicine. Positive samples undergo GAG isolation for subsequent characterization. Here, we describe a 3-year-old English Cocker Spaniel with a positive urinary GAG test, but without other clinical signs of MPS. Urine samples were strongly positive with the dimethylmethylene blue test, and isolated GAG subjected to electrophoresis on cellulose acetate revealed a band co-migrating with dermatan sulfate. However, the isolated GAG were resistant to digestion with chondroitinase ABC, suggesting that the band did not represent dermatan sulfate. This was confirmed by mobility of the isolated GAG different from dermatan sulfate on agarose gel electrophoresis. MPS types VI and VII were excluded by enzyme assay. To test the hypothesis of a nutritional source, a healthy control dog was fed the same dog food as the index case. His urine showed a comparable abnormal GAG screening test and electrophoretic pattern. In addition, the analysis of an algal supplement present in the administered dog food showed a similar electrophoretic GAG pattern. The Cocker Spaniel was not available for further testing after withdrawal of the supplement. Algae contain highly sulfated fucans and galactans, and it appears that commercial dog food containing such algal, and possibly other, supplements can give rise to false-positive urinary MPS screening tests.},

Animals-289 dogs identified through the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB) and 27 dogs examined at the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital.
Procedure-Demographic characteristics of dogs identified through the VMDB were compared with characteristics of the entire population of dogs entered in the VMDB. Medical records of dogs examined at the teaching hospital were reviewed; the diagnosis was confirmed through review of thoracic radiographs.
Results-Analysis of data from the VMDB indicated that American Cocker Spaniels, West Highland White Terriers, Miniature Poodles, Siberian Huskies, English Springer Spaniels, and dogs {\textgreater} 10 years old had an increased risk of bronchiectasis. Among dogs examined at the teaching hospital, coughing was the most common clinical sign. There was evidence for excessive airway mucus but not hemorrhage. A variety of bacterial organisms were isolated from tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. On thoracic radiographs, cylindrical bronchiectasis, generalized disease, and right cranial lung lobe involvement were most common. Seven of 14 dogs for which follow-up radiographs were available did not have any progression of radiographic lesions. Median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis of bronchiectasis was 9 months (range, 1 day to 10 years). Median survival time was 16 months (range, 2 days to 72 months).

Procedures-Cause of glaucoma was determined from records. Breed, age, sex, and neuter status of all dogs with secondary glaucoma were compared with the general hospital population. The prevalence of secondary glaucoma in dogs with a primary diagnosis of lens dislocation or anterior uveitis during the same period was determined.
Results-Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed in 156 of 2,257 (6.9\%) dogs examined because of ophthalmic disease and was bilateral in 33 (21.2\%) of those dogs. In 31 (94\%) bilaterally affected dogs, the antecedent cause was the same in both eyes. Common causes of secondary glaucoma were nonsurgical anterior uveitis (44.9\%), anterior uveitis associated with prior phacoemulsification (15.8\%), and lens dislocation (15.2\%). Parson Russell Terriers, Poodles, Boston Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and Australian Cattle Dogs had diagnoses of secondary glaucoma more often than expected, compared with the reference population. Age, sex, neuter status, and laterality were not associated with secondary glaucoma. The prevalence of secondary glaucoma in dogs with lens dislocation or uveitis was 15\% or 17\%, respectively.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Glaucoma develops secondary to many intraocular diseases, particularly uveitis and lens dislocation. Diagnosis of these diseases should prompt frequent monitoring of intraocular pressure, regardless of signalment.},

	abstract = {Pneumocystis is an atypical fungus that resides in the pulmonary parenchyma of many mammals, including humans and dogs. Immunocompetent human hosts are usually asymptomatically colonised or show subtle clinical signs, but some immunocompromised people can develop florid life-threatening Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Since much less is known concerning Pneumocystis in dogs, we posit the question: can Pneumocystis colonization be present in dogs with inflammatory airway or lung disease caused by other pathogens or disease processes? In this study, Pneumocystis DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 22/255 dogs (9\%) with respiratory distress and/or chronic cough. Although young dogs ({\textless}1 year-of-age) and pedigree breeds were more often Pneumocystis-qPCR positive than older dogs and crossbreds, adult dogs with other infectious conditions and/or a history of therapy-resistant pulmonary disease could also be qPCR-positive, including two patients with suppression of the immune system. Absence of pathognomonic clinical or radiographic signs render it impossible to convincingly discriminate between overt PCP versus other lung/airway disease processes colonised by P. canis. It is possible that colonisation with P. canis might play a certain role as a co-pathogen in some canine patients with lower respiratory disease.},

Standardized dorsal and sagittal reconstructions were created at 3 levels using image analysis software to obtain single measurements of the humero-radial and humero-ulnar joint spaces. On dorsal plane reconstructions, joint space measurements were obtained at the center point of the humero-radial and humero-ulnar articulations. Joint incongruity was defined as the difference between the humero-radial and the humero-ulnar joint spaces.
Results - Nineteen dogs (95\%), all Spaniel breeds, had either bilateral IOHC demonstrable as a saw-toothed intercondylar complete or incomplete hypoattenuating defect with hyperattenuating margins, or IOHC with contralateral humeral condylar fracture (HCF). Joint incongruity values for IOHC were compared with those of normal elbows. Significant differences were noted at the levels of the medial coronoid apex (P {\textless}.0001) and base (P {\textless}.004) indicative of humero-ulnar incongruence. Evidence of medial coronoid disease in 10 elbows (26\%) and degenerative joint disease in 30 elbows (79\%) was also found.
Conclusions - Presence of elbow incongruence may be an underlying factor in failure of ossification centers to fuse leading to IOHC.
Clinical Relevance - IOHC is clearly defined by CT, and it should be considered in larger Spaniel breeds, with a chronic forelimb lameness or HCF. (c) Copyright 2008 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.},

We used multi-slice CT scanner to examine occipital area of 138 purebreds dogs. Two studied groups could be distinguished - living animals undergoing standard diagnostic CT procedure (n = 47) and macerated skulls of euthanized dogs (n = 91). Morphometric analysis was focused on presence of dorsal notch within foramen magnum. This anatomical feature was present in 33.3\% of examined dogs. It was more often observed in small size dogs (70\%) and those of brachycephalic morphotype (94.1\%). For the first time dorsal notch was noted in breeds such as French Bulldog, Fox Terrier, Keeshond, Standard Schnauzer, English Bulldog, Cocker Spaniel, Boxer and Rottweiler. We distinguished four different shape of FM: oval, pentagonal, rhomboid and circular. Most common FM shape was oval (41 dogs; 45\%) whereas circular type was least observed (5 dogs; 5.5\%). The pentagonal shape was noticed in 27 specimens (29.7\%) and the rhomboid shape in 18 dogs (19.8\%). Authors conclude that dorsal notch is not pathology and should be considered a morphological variation within the normal anatomy. Results presented in this study should be taken into account during interpretation of the CT images of the craniocervical junction.},

	abstract = {Update on mitral valve endocardiosis Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) or degenerative mitral valve disease is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. The disease prevalence is age-related with small-sized breeds being more commonly affected than large breed dogs. MMVD typically affects older dogs with the exception of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and bull terrier, both of which can develop the disease at an early age. The initiating stimuli are not completely understood but a variety of chemical and biomechanical mechanisms seem to be responsible for the valvular degeneration. The course of the disease is generally regarded as benign, with only 10\% of dogs developing clinically significant disease. The gold standard for diagnosis is still echocardiography. Echocardiographically, not only the left ventricular and left atrial dimensions can be assessed but also intracardiac pressures can be measured, Therapy is dependent on disease severity. Mild diseases do not require any therapy, whereas congestive heart failure should be treated with a triple therapy consisting of pimobendan, an ace-inhibitor and furosemide. Surgical mitral valve repair has become an option for treatment and has recently shown promising results. The major drawback of open-heart surgery, the immense technical effort in combination with high costs, could potentially be overcome by the development of catheter-based methods.},

Animals-41 Beagles, 43 Labrador Retrievers, 25 Golden Retrievers, 26 English Springer Spaniels, and 22 Shetland Sheepdogs.
Procedure-Beagles had STT and STTa values measured twice daily far 5 days. Client-owned dogs of 4 other breeds had STT and STTa values measured once.
Results-Mean +/- SD values of Beagles for STT and STTa were 20.2 +/- 2.5 and 3.8 +/- 2.7 mm/min. Mean values for STT and STTa were as follows: Labrador Retriever, 22.9 +/- 4.1 and 9.6 +/- 3.8 mm/min; English Springer Spaniel; 20.7 +/- 3.2 and 5.4 +/- 3.4 mm/min; Golden Retriever, 21.8 +/- 3.7 and 8.8 +/- 3.1 mm/min and Shetland Sheepdog, 75.8 +/- 1.8 and 3.6 +/- 2.8 mm/min.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results for the STT reported here compare favorably with reported values, except for results of Shetland Sheepdogs; however, results for the STTa differ dramatically from reported values.

Procedures Clinical data for CASFB cases were compared to those available for the remaining AHT ophthalmic population over the same period. The depth of the FB trauma was divided into five categories. The type of FB and method of removal were described for each category. The degree of secondary uveitis and lens involvement was graded and correlated with subsequent enucleation. Results The mean age (standard deviation) of 218 identified CASFB cases was 3.96 (2.95) years. Risk factors for CASFB trauma were dogs younger than 5 years, English Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and working dogs. Most dogs required general anesthesia for FB removal, and hypodermic needles were the most commonly used instrument. The lens was involved in some cases with a full-thickness CASFB trauma (n = 49, 45\%), but most suffered a minor lens trauma (n = 37, 76\%). The lens trauma and phacoclastic uveitis were managed medically in most dogs (n = 37, 76\%), and phacoemulsification was only elected as initial treatment in some dogs (n = 10, 20\%). Enucleation was required overall in 6\% of dogs. Statistically significant associations were found between enucleation and depth of FB trauma, degree of uveitis, and severity of lens trauma (P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions Young dogs, English Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and working dogs had an increased risk of CASFB trauma. Risk factors for enucleation were fullthickness FB penetration, severe lens trauma, and severe uveitis.},

	abstract = {Hypospadias is rarely reported in dogs. In this study we present 2 novel cases of this disorder of sexual development and, in addition, a case of hereditary sex reversal in a female with an enlarged clitoris. The first case was a male Moscow watchdog with a normal karyotype (78,XY) and the presence of the SRY gene. In this dog, perineal hypospadias, bilateral inguinal cryptorchidism and testes were observed. The second case, representing the Cocker spaniel breed, had a small penis with a hypospadic orifice of the urethra, bilateral cryptorchidisnn, testis and a rudimentary gonad inside an ovarian bursa, a normal female karyotype (78,XX) and a lack of the SRY gene. This animal was classified as a compound sex reversal (78,XX, SRY-negative) with the hypospadias syndrome. The third case was a Cocker spaniel female with an enlarged clitoris and internally located ovotestes. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a normal female karyotype (78,XX) and a lack of the SRY gene, while histology of the gonads showed an ovotesticular structure. This case was classified as a typical hereditary sex reversal syndrome (78,XX, SPY-negative). Molecular studies were focused on coding sequences of the SRY gene (case 1) and 2 candidates for monogenic hypospadias, namely MAMLD1 (mastermind-like domain containing 1) and SRD5A2 (steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2). Sequencing of the entire SPY gene, including 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, did not reveal any mutation. The entire coding sequence of MAMLD1 and SRD5A2 was analyzed in all the intersexes, as well as in 4 phenotypically normal control dogs (3 females and 1 male). In MAMLD1 2 SNPs, including 1 missense substitution in exon 1 (c.128A {\textgreater} G, Asp43Ser), were identified, whereas in SRD5A2 7 polymorphisms, including 1 missense SNP (c.358G {\textgreater} A, Ala120Thr), were found. None of the identified polymorphisms cosegregated with the intersexual phenotype, thus, we cannot confirm that hypospadias may be associated with polymorphism in the coding sequence of the studied genes.

The objective of this prospective reference interval study was to provide breed-specific echocardiographic values for healthy French Bulldogs. A total of 42 healthy French Bulldogs of both sexes (23 females and 19 males) were sampled. Furthermore, measurements for a control group (n = 16) were also conducted in four other dog breeds (Cocker Spaniel [n = 2], Cavalier King Charles Spaniel [n = 4], Terrier [n = 5], and Crossbreed [n = 5]). Standard M-mode, two-dimensional (2D), pulse wave (PW) Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiographic measurements were obtained from healthy French Bulldogs. The M-mode echocardiographic data obtained from French Bulldogs were compared to the data obtained from the control group. The left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole (LVIDd; cm)/body surface area (BSA) (m(2)) ratio for the study group was 3.35/0.53 = 6.32. Left ventricular measurements for French bulldogs and internal dimension at end-systole (21.23 +/- 3.50 mm) and at end-diastole (33.50 +/- 4.12 mm) were found to be significantly higher (P {\textless} .001) compared to control group values (left ventricular internal dimension at end-systole [LVIDs]; 17.46 +/- 2.85 mm, LVIDd; 27.16 +/- 4.20 mm, respectively). A significantly positive correlation in the French Bulldog group was noted between body weight and M-mode measurements (EPSS, IVSd, IVSs, LVIDd, LVIDs, and LVPWd). French bulldogs had a greater systolic and diastolic left ventricular volume than the control group. As a result, values reported in this study could be used as specific reference ranges in French Bulldogs.},

	abstract = {It is already known that the beagle breed of domestic dogs produces semiochemicals capable of repelling the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.). With a view to discovering new non-host semiochemicals as tick repellents, we compared the semiochemicals produced by a putative tick-resistant breed of dog , miniature pinscher, with known tick-resistant (beagle) and tick-susceptible (English cocker spaniel) breeds. Two non-host compounds produced by beagles, i.e. 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde, were shown to be present in samples collected from all three breeds. Furthermore, two compounds, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, were found in higher amounts in samples collected from miniature pinscher dogs. The mean amounts of benzaldehyde, 2-hexanone and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were similar for beagles and miniature pinschers (P {\textless} 0.05) and higher than the means observed for cocker spaniels (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas the mean amount of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one produced by miniature pinschers was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) than for the other breeds of dogs. In Petri-dish assays with adult R. sanguineus s.l., 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was repellent for all observation periods evaluated for the two highest concentrations (0.100 and 0.200 mg.cm(-2), P {\textless} 0.01). The obtained results support our hypothesis that miniature pinschers are a tick-resistant dog breed and agree with previous observations of miniature pinschers being the breed least parasitized by ticks. Furthermore, the non-host semiochemical 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one has potential to be developed for use as a repellent for the protection of susceptible dogs from R. sanguineus s.l. ticks.},

	abstract = {Domestic dog breeds are hosts for the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, but infestation levels vary among breeds. Beagles are less susceptible to tick infestations than English cocker spaniels due to enhanced production of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde that act as volatile tick repellents. We report the use of prototype slow-release formulations of these compounds to reduce the burden of R. sanguineus s. l. on English cocker spaniel dogs. Twelve dogs were randomly assigned to two groups with six dogs each. The treated group received collars with slow-release formulations of the compounds attached, while the control group received collars with clean formulations attached. Five environmental infestations were performed, with the number of ticks (at all stages) on the dogs being counted twice a day for 45 days. The counts on the number of tick stages found per dog were individually fitted to linear mixed effects models with repeated measures and normal distribution for errors. The mean tick infestation in the treated group was significantly lower than in the control group. For larvae and nymphs, a decrease in tick infestation was observed at the fifth count, and for adults, lower average counts were observed in all counts. The compounds did not interfere with the distribution of the ticks on the body of the dogs, as a similar percentage of ticks was found on the anterior half of the dogs (54.5\% for the control group and 56.2\% for the treated group). The biological and reproductive parameters of the ticks were not affected by the repellents. This study highlights for the first time the potential use of a novel allomone (repellent)-based formulation for reduction of tick infestation on susceptible dogs. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {The aim of the current study was to quantify the risk of tail injury, to evaluate the extent to which tail docking reduces this risk, and to identify other major risk factors for tail injury in dogs in Great Britain. A nested case-control study was conducted during 2008 and 2009. Data were obtained from a stratified random sample of veterinary practices throughout Great Britain, and questionnaires were sent to owners of dogs with tail injuries and owners of a randomly selected sample of dogs without tail injuries. The risks of injury were reported adjusting for the sampling approach, and mixed effects logistic regression was used to develop a multivariable model for risk factors associated with tail injury. Two hundred and eighty-one tail injuries were recorded from a population of 138,212 dogs attending 52 participating practices. The weighted risk of tail injuries was 0.23 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 0.20 to 0.25 per cent). Thirty-six per cent of injuries were reportedly related to injuries sustained in the home, 17.5 per cent were outdoor-related injuries, 14.4 per cent were due to the tail being caught in a door, for 16.5 per cent the cause was unknown and the remainder were due to other causes. Dogs with a wide angle of wag and dogs kept in kennels were at significantly higher risk of sustaining a tail injury. Dogs with docked tails were significantly less likely to sustain a tail injury; however, approximately 500 dogs would need to be docked in order to prevent one tail injury. English springer spaniels, cocker spaniels, greyhounds, lurchers and whippets were all at significantly higher risk when compared to labradors and other retrievers. Differences between countries (England, Scotland and Wales) and between rural and urban environments were not significant.},

Current diagnostic criteria for this condition are subjective and clinician-dependent; objective criteria are needed to allow a reliable and reproducible diagnosis in clinical and research settings and assess clinical significance. We propose four standardized MRI-based measurements to objectively assess the proximity of the atlas to the foramen magnum. Inclusion criteria for dogs in this study were bodyweight {\textless}15 kg, age {\textgreater}5 months, and availability of a complete MRI study performed with the craniocervical junction in extension. Exclusion criteria were space occupying lesions and poor image quality (i.e. unclear bony margins). Measurements also included blinded determinations of skull type, presence of craniocervical junction anomalies and presence and severity of syringomyelia. Clinical status at the time of imaging was noted. Measurements were obtained in 271 dogs; these were reproducible and reliable. Findings varied by skull type: dolichocephalic dogs had smaller foramen magnum, whereas brachycephalic dogs had more cranially and dorsally positioned atlas bodies in comparison to the other skull types.
Measurements also increased with increases in bodyweight. This study demonstrated a close association between AOO, syringomyelia and clinical signs. Toy and small breed dogs (including Cavalier King Charles spaniels) showed higher than previously reported prevalence of AOO; its occurrence was also associated with lower bodyweights within the study population of {\textless}15 kg toy/small breed dogs.

The incidence of MCTs for registered breeds in Austria, an estimate of the risk by means of the odds ratios based on breed as well as the anatomic localisation of MCTs were examined. Material and methods: In the first part of the study, the ranking of breeds in Austria based on 147,802 dogs with known breed (including mixed breed) was determined, based on those dogs included in the laboratory data base from 2000 to 2010. In the second part of the study, 476 dogs were identified with MCTs and analysed by age, sex, Patnaik grade of MCI and breed distribution. The odds ratios with confidence intervals were calculated for all breeds with skin tumours. Results: The age distribution showed a peak in the age group from 6.1 to 8.0 years; 70\% of MCTs were localised to the head and trunk. No significant difference was found based on gender. The evaluation of the odds ratios showed that only four of the 20 of the most popular in Austria breeds (Boxer, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, Spaniel) had an increased risk; on the other hand, some breeds which have not been previously identified in the literature were indicated to have a significantly increased risk for MCT (e.g., Dogo Argentino, Tibetan Spaniel, Pyrenean Mountain Dog, Beauceron, and Austrian Smooth-haired Hound). Conclusion and clinical relevance: Because disease risk may influence the popularity of some currently rare breeds, consultation with breeders and owners regarding the identification of the breeds newly identified in this study as an increased risk for development of mast cell tumours is indicated.},

The dog was treated with ivermectin (Avromec, 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously) and multivitamin syrup (Vitabiol) for 5 days for supporting the body condition. This paper is the first clinical case report of S. stercoralis in a dog in Turkey.},

Both types of cells were positive for CK14, a myoepithelial cell marker. Ultrastructurally, the ductal epithelial cells were attached by desmosomes and contained abundant intracytoplasmic tonofilaments. Some ductal epithelial cells contained myofilaments characteristic of myoepithelial cells. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma was made.

The samples included one tissue each from 17 males and six females 2 to 16 years of age (mean = 7.5 years). Twelve breeds were represented, including three Cocker Spaniels, three Golden Retrievers, and live of mixed breed. Ten of the samples were histologically classified as malignant-plasma cell tumors, and ten specimens were classified as benign. Three samples of plasmacytic inflammation, from two Cocker Spaniels and one Shih Tsu, were included as controls. The ploidy and relative c-myc content data obtained were compared with the histologic grade. A significant difference in ploidy was found between benign and malignant tumors (P less than or equal to 0.05). Five of nine malignant plasma cell tumors were aneuploid; the remainder were diploid (4/9) or tetraploid (1/9). Only one of the benign plasmacytomas was aneuploid (1/10), whereas six were diploid (6/10), and three were tetraploid (3/10). All of the controls were diploid (3/32). When relative amounts of p62(c-myc) from malignant and benign tumors were compared by flow cytometry, a greater significant difference was established (P less than or equal to 0.01) than by using aneuploidy alone. Relative values of p62(c-myc) content ranged from 219 to 553 units in 8/10 malignant plasma cell tumors and from 86 to 392 units in 3/10 benign plasmacytomas. The remainder of the neoplasms (2/10 malignant and 7/10 benign) lacked measurable values of p62(c-myc) above background fluorescence concentrations. Two atypical cutaneous plasmacytomas with later metastasis were included in the study. The results indicate that simultaneous analysis of ploidy and relative p62(c-myc) concentration can be used as an aid in assessment of malignant potential in canine plasma cell tumors.},

	abstract = {The novels of J.G. Farrell (1935-79), reveal a writer preoccupied with the cultural representation of Britain in an era of post-imperial decline. Farrell's Empire trilogy' illustrates a national consciousness examining its chequered past through focus on Ireland in Troubles (1970), the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in The Siege of Krishnapur (1973) and the fall of Singapore in The Singapore Grip (1978). In doing so, Farrell's novels feature a notable proliferation of flora and fauna, particularly his use of dogs as representative of national character and the changeable state of British society under attack. This article argues that Farrell's novels explore the state of post-imperial Britain through a sustained focus on dogs and animality. In situations marked by degradation and decline, Farrell gradually collapses the boundaries of order and disorder, obedience and disobedience and man and beast, inviting comparisons between the animal instincts of the dogs that populate his novels and those of Britons fighting for survival.},

	abstract = {A 1-year and 11-month- old English Cocker Spaniel was evaluated for clinical signs of progressive right pelvic limb lameness and urinary incontinence. Neurological examination was suggestive of a lesion localized to the L4-S3 spinal cord segments. No abnormalities were seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the dog in dorsal recumbency and the hips in a neutral position and the conus medullaris ended halfway the vertebral body of L7. An MRI of the hips in extended and flexed positions demonstrated minimal displacement of the conus medullaris in the cranial and caudal directions, respectively. Similar to the images in neutral position, the conus medullaris ended halfway the vertebral body of L7 in both the extended and flexed positions. In comparison, an MRI of the hips in neutral, extended, and flexed positions performed in another English Cocker Spaniel revealed obvious cranial displacement of the conus medullaris with the hips in extension and caudal displacement with hips in flexion. A standard dorsal lumbosacral laminectomy was performed. Visual inspection of the vertebral canal revealed excessive caudal traction on the conus medullaris. After sectioning the distal aspect of the filum terminale, the conus medullaris regained a more cranial position. A neurological examination 4 weeks after surgery revealed clinical improvement. Neurological examinations at 2, 4, 7, and 12 months after surgery did not reveal any abnormalities, and the dog was considered to be clinically normal. Tethered cord syndrome with a tight filum terminale is a very rare congenital anomaly and is characterized by an abnormally short and inelastic filum terminale. Therefore, this disorder is associated with abnormal caudal traction on the spinal cord and decreased physiological craniocaudal movements of the neural structures within the vertebral canal. Although further studies are necessary to evaluate and quantify physiological craniocaudal movement of the spinal cord and conus medullaris in neurologically normal dogs, the results of this report suggest further exploration of dynamic MRI to demonstrate decreased craniocaudal displacement of the conus medullaris in dogs with tethered cord syndrome with a tight filum terminale.},

Client-owned asymptomatic, untreated dogs were divided into 4 groups: 14 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (Cavaliers) with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 17 Cavaliers with MVP and moderate to severe MR, 14 control dogs, and 10 dogs with subaortic stenosis (SAS). Clinical examinations and echocardiography were performed in all dogs. PFA100 closure times (the ability of platelets to occlude a hole in a membrane at high shear rates), platelet activation markers (plasma thromboxane 132 concentration, platelet surface P-selectin expression), platelet aggregation (in whole blood and platelet-rich plasma with 3 different agonists), and vWf multimers were analyzed. Cavaliers with moderate to severe MR and dogs with SAS had longer closure times and a lower percentage of the largest vWf multimers than did controls. Maximal aggregation responses were unchanged in dogs with SAS but enhanced in Cavaliers with MVP (regardless of MR status) compared with control dogs. No significant difference in platelet activation markers was found among groups. The data suggest that a form of platelet dysfunction detected at high shear rates was present in dogs with MR and SAS, possibly associated with a qualitative vWf defect. Aggregation results suggest increased platelet reactivity in Cavaliers, but the platelets did not appear to circulate in a preactivated state in either disease.},

Objective To investigate BP and HR responses in different clinical settings in dogs of 3 breeds, and to relate findings to urinary catecholamine concentrations measured by ELISA assays previously validated for use in human plasma and urine, after validation for use in dogs.
Animals Client-owned healthy dogs; 41 Labrador Retrievers, 33 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), and 15 Dachshunds.
Methods Prospective observational study. BP and HR were measured in 4 clinical settings with or without veterinarian and owner present. Urine samples were taken before and after examination. ELISA assays were validated for canine urine, and epinephrine/creatinine and norepinephrine/creatinine ratios were analyzed.
Results BP and HR were higher when measured by veterinarian alone than when owner was present (P {\textless} .020). Urinary catecholamine/creatinine ratios were higher after examination, compared with before, in all dogs (P {\textless} .0001). Labrador Retrievers had lower diastolic BP than Dachshunds in 2 settings (P = .041), lower HR than CKCSs in 3 settings (all P {\textless} .0001), and lower catecholamine/creatinine ratios after examination than both other breeds (P = .035). The in-house validation showed mean spiked recovery of 96.5\% for epinephrine and 83.8\% for norepinephrine.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance BP and HR responses were related to breed as well as clinical setting. Breed differences were detected in urinary catecholamine/creatinine ratios. Further studies on breed differences are warranted.},

	volume = {51},
	issn = {1678-0345},
	doi = {10.22456/1679-9216.126060},
	abstract = {Background: Lymphoma neoplasms originate from the lymphocytes. Anatomically, these tumors can be classified into multicentric, digestive, mediastinal, and cutaneous forms. The etiology of cutaneous lymphoma remains unclear; however, it has been associated with chronic skin inflammation. The definitive diagnosis is based on histological analysis and immunohistochemistry, although fine-needle aspiration cytology has shown good results. The aim of this paper is to describe the clinicopathological aspects of a case of cutaneous epitheliotropic T cell lymphoma, classified as mycosis fungoides, in a Lhasa Apso dog.
Case: A 8-year-old bitch Lhasa Apso with multiple non-pruritic skin nodules and history of 10-day evolution was referred to the Veterinary Hospital of the Centro Universitario do Espirito Santo (UNESC), Colatina, ES, Brazil. The nodules were erythematous, exophytic, firm, circumscribed, and measured 0.2-4 cm in diameter in locations throughout the animal's body. An incisional biopsy was performed with an 8-mm punch and sent for histopathological examination. An infiltrative, poorly demarcated, non-encapsulated, densely cellular neoplasm, which was replacing the dermal collagen and displacing the adnexa, was observed in the dermis. The tumor was composed of a population of round cells, with generally distinct cell borders and a small-to-moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were irregularly rounded and occasionally edentulous, with vesicular chromatin, a visible nucleus, and 11 mitotic figures in an area of 2.37 mm2. The immunohistochemical test, which was positive for the CD3 marker, confirmed the diagnosis of T cell lymphoma. On an ultrasound to identify metastasis, the liver showed heterogeneous parenchyma, heterogeneous expansive formation, areas of cavitary appearance, and cytology compatible with lymphoma. Antineoplastic chemotherapy was administered using the CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). However, the animal died after 45 days.
Discussion: A diagnosis of the mycosis fungoides type of cutaneous epitheliotropic T cell lymphoma was established based on clinical, laboratory, anatomopathological, and immunohistochemical findings. Pruritus is a common clinical condition in animals with mycosis fungoides, particularly in those with the erythrodermic form of the disease. Epitheliotropic lymphomas have no sexual or racial predilections and usually affect dogs over 9 years of age. The Cocker Spaniel, English Bulldog, Boxer, Golden Retriever, Scottish Terrier, Briard, English Springer Spaniel, Beagle, German Shepherd, and English Cocker Spaniel breeds are frequently affected by these lymphomas. These neoplasms can have a primary skin origin, or they can be secondary and associated with lymphoma found elsewhere in the body. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice, especially in cases with multifocal distribution. Protocol preference varies with disease stage, patient clinical and laboratory conditions, and the degree of toxicity. Commonly used chemotherapy regimens include L-CHOP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, L-asparaginase, and prednisolone), CHOP, COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), LAP (lomustine, L-asparaginase, and prednisolone), LOPP (lomustine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone), chlorambucil, and prednisolone. The prognosis of canine epitheliotropic cutaneous lymphoma is unfavorable, with a survival time ranging from a few months to 2 years. The animal in this study survived for 105 days. In addition, epitheliotropic cutaneous T cell lymphoma is aggressive, which may result in a shorter survival time in animals affected by this type of tumor.},

	abstract = {Background: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in geriatric dogs despite conventional therapy.
Hypothesis: Pimobendan in addition to conventional therapy will extend time to sudden cardiac death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure when compared with conventional therapy plus benazepril in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) attributable to MMVD.
Animals: Two hundred and sixty client-owned dogs in CHF caused by MMVD were recruited from 28 centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia.
Methods: A prospective single-blinded study with dogs randomized to PO receive pimobendan (0.4-0.6 mg/kg/d) or benazepril hydrochloride (0.25-1.0 mg/kg/d). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, euthanized for heart failure, or treatment failure.
Results: Eight dogs were excluded from analysis. One hundred and twenty-four dogs were randomized to pimobendan and 128 to benazepril. One hundred and ninety dogs reached the primary endpoint; the median time was 188 days (267 days for pimobendan, 140 days for benazepril hazard ratio = 0.688, 95\% confidence limits [CL] = 0.516-0.916, P = .0099). The benefit of pimobendan persisted after adjusting for all baseline variables. A longer time to reach the endpoint was also associated with being a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, requiring a lower furosemide dose, and having a higher creatinine concentration. Increases in several indicators of cardiac enlargement (left atrial to aortic root ratio, vertebral heart scale, and percentage increase in left ventricular internal diameter in systole) were associated with a shorter time to endpoint, as was a worse tolerance for exercise.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Pimobendan plus conventional therapy prolongs time to sudden death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure in dogs with CHF caused by MMVD compared with benazepril plus conventional therapy.},

	abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart disease which is often found in humans and animals. The age of onset of this progressive disease varies between 3 and 7 years of age. A juvenile form of DCM has been found in Portuguese Water Dogs and Doberman Pinscher Dogs. Some breeds such as Doberman pinscher, Newfoundland, Portuguese Water dog, Boxer, Great Dane, Cocker Spaniel and Irish Wolfhound exhibit a higher prevalence to DCM. There also seems to be a sex predisposition as male dogs are affected more often than female dogs and in Great Danes an X-linked recessive inheritance is likely. In Newfoundland and Boxer an autosomal dominant inheritance was found whereas an autosomal recessive inheritance was described in Portuguese Water Dogs. Atrial fibrillation as a cause or consequence of DCM is assumed for certain breeds. The causes of DCM are widely unknown in dogs. A genetic basis for this heart disease seems to exist. Apart from a few exceptions the mode of inheritance and the possible underlying gene mutations are not known for DCM in dogs. In humans mutations in several genes responsible for DCM have been identified. Comparative genetic analyses in dogs using genes causing DCM in men and a genome-wide scan with anonymus markers were not able to detect causative mutations or genomic regions harboring gene loci linked to DCM. The investigation of the genetic basis of canine DCM may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of DCM and may result in new therapeutic approaches and breeding strategies.},

	abstract = {Background
The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has recently been suggested to play a role in the development of naturally acquired myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs.
Aim
To investigate the association between serum 5-HT concentration and MMVD severity in dogs, and to assess potential associations between serum 5-HT concentrations and dog characteristics, echocardiographic variables, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, presence of macrothrombocytosis, and plateletcrit.
Animals
A total of 120 client-owned dogs.
Material and Methods
Dogs were prospectively recruited and were classified by standard echocardiography into healthy (dogs of breeds predisposed to MMVD, but without echocardiographic evidence of the disease), mild, moderate, or severe MMVD groups. Serum 5-HT concentrations were analyzed using an ELISA.
Results
Dogs with severe MMVD had lower serum 5-HT concentrations than healthy dogs (P=.0025) and dogs with mild MMVD (P=.0011). Unilinear and multiple regression analyses showed that serum 5-HT concentrations decreased with increasing left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao), were higher in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs compared to dogs of other breeds, and were higher in female dogs than in male dogs. The LA/Ao was the variable most strongly associated with serum 5-HT concentration.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance
The finding of higher serum 5-HT concentrations in dogs of breeds predisposed to the early onset of MMVD (CKCS) and dogs with mild MMVD suggests that alterations in 5-HT signaling might play a role in progression of early stages of MMVD.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0378.x},
	abstract = {Background
Increased serotonin (5HT) signaling has been implicated in valvular disease of humans and animals, including canine degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD). High circulating 5HT concentration is a potential source of increased signaling, and serum 5HT concentrations have not been previously reported in dogs with DMVD.
Hypothesis
Dogs with DMVD and small breed dogs predisposed to DMVD have higher serum 5HT concentrations than large breed controls.
Animals
Fifty dogs affected with DMVD, 34 dogs predisposed to DMVD but without cardiac murmur or echocardiographic evidence of DMVD, and 36 healthy large breed control dogs.
Methods
Prospective analysis. Serum 5HT concentration was measured by an ELISA test.
Results
Median serum 5HT concentration was significantly higher in dogs with DMVD and in dogs predisposed to DMVD as compared with controls (DMVD, 765.5 ng/mL [interquartile range, 561.3-944.4]; predisposed, 774.9 ng/mL [528.3-1,026]; control, 509.8 ng/mL [320.8-708.8]; P = .0001). Subgroup analysis of predisposed dogs indicated significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs than in other breeds (CKCS, 855.0 ng/mL [635.8-1,088]; non-CKCS, 554.2 ng/mL [380.6-648.4]; P = .0023). Age, platelet count, and platelet morphology were not correlated with 5HT concentration in any group.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance
Dogs with DMVD had significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations when compared with large breed control dogs. Healthy CKCS dogs had significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations than other healthy dogs predisposed to DMVD. Additional investigation into a possible role of 5HT in the pathogenesis of DMVD is warranted.},

Furthermore, breed variation and white-coat effect have been tested by sampling three different dog breeds both in their home and in a clinical setting. Short-term exercise increased plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). There was significant difference between Pointers and the small dog breeds Cairn Terriers and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the general plasma levels of vWf and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). NOx and vWf were significantly higher when the sample was taken in the laboratory cf. at home, whereas ADMA and L-arginine were significantly lower. In conclusion, both short-term exercise and white-coat effect influence several plasma markers of endothelial function depending also on the breed and gender of the dogs.

Serial biochemistry measurements postprocedure confirmed marked improvements in serum bilirubin. The patient remains clinically well 24 months postprocedure, and all hepatic enzyme activities have normalised.

A quantitative PCR method was developed to monitor and finally verify successful treatment.

	abstract = {Objective To determine the prevalence of secondary glaucomas in dogs associated with cataract formation, lens luxation or displacement, cataract surgery, uveitis, hyphema and intraocular neoplasia.
Methods Information was obtained from the Veterinary Medical Data Base (VMDB) from all veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America from March 1964 to March 2003. Secondary glaucomas were diagnosed at the same examination or after the primary diagnosis was made, and included those associated with cataract formation, lens luxation, cataract surgery, uveitis of unknown cause, hyphema of unknown cause, and intraocular neoplasia. The data were evaluated by decade, breed, gender and age of presentation.
Results A total of 1 592 831 dogs were presented, and 9695 canine secondary glaucomas. Secondary glaucoma associated with cataract formation represented 81\% of all the canine secondary glaucomas. Breeds (n = 7890 dogs) predisposed to secondary glaucoma and cataracts had an overall prevalence of 0.5\%, but nearly 20\% of all the cataractous dogs developed secondary glaucoma in at least one eye. For the years 1994-2003, these breeds included the American Cocker Spaniel; Boston Terrier; Toy, Miniature and Standard Poodle; English Springer Spaniel; Bichon Frise; and Labrador Retriever. The other forms of secondary glaucoma occurred less frequently, and included those glaucomas with lens luxation or displacement (779 dogs; 12.0\%), postcataract surgery (528 dogs; 5.1\%), with uveitis from unknown cause (399 dogs; 7.1\%), with hyphema from unknown cause (117 dogs; 7.3\%), and with intraocular neoplasia (19 dogs; 3.5\%). The risk of the secondary glaucomas from 1984 to 2002 was highest after the intracapsular lens extraction (ICLE), less in the extracapsular technique (ECLE), and lowest for the phacoemulsification/phacofragmentation method.
Conclusion Prevalence of the canine secondary glaucomas ranges from 0.25\% (1964-1973), 0.46\% (1974-1983), 0.79\% (1984-1993), to 0.80\% (1994-2003) and are as frequent as the primary or breed-related glaucomas during these same time periods.},

Fifty clinically healthy dogs older than I year (median 5.0 years; interquartile interval 2.6-8.2 years) were studied, including 9 controls of various breeds, 23 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) with no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 9 CKCSs with mild MR (regurgitant jet occupying 15-50\% of the left atrial area), and 9 CKCS with moderate to severe MR (jet {\textgreater}50\%) due to myxomatous valve disease. None of the dogs received medication. The dogs were given NOx-free water and a diet with a low concentration of NOx for 96 hours before blood sampling. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that dog group, but not gender, age, serum creatinine concentration, and platelet count, was associated with NOx concentrations. Control dogs had the same NOx concentration (median 20.0 muM; interquartile interval 15.1-25.5 muM) as CKCSs without MR (median 18.7 muM; interquartile interval 15.5-25.9 muM). Compared to CKCSs without MR, the NOx concentration was lower in CKCSs with mild (median 12.9 muM; interquartile interval 11.0-13.5 muM; P = .04) and moderate to severe (median 11.2 muM; interquartile interval 6.9-17.1 muM; P = .02) MR.

	abstract = {Background: A classic sign of canine syringomyelia (SM) is scratching towards one shoulder. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we investigate the spinal cord lesion relating to this phenomenon which has characteristics similar to fictive scratch secondary to spinal cord transection. Medical records were searched for Cavalier King Charles spaniels with a clinical and MRI diagnosis of symptomatic SM associated with Chiari-like malformation (CM). The cohort was divided into SM with phantom scratching (19 dogs) and SM but no phantom scratching (18 dogs). MRI files were anonymised, randomised and viewed in EFILM (TM) For each transverse image, the maximum perpendicular dimensions of the syrinx in the dorsal spinal cord quadrants were determined. Visual assessment was made as to whether the syrinx extended to the superficial dorsal horn (SDH).
Results: We showed that phantom scratching appears associated with a large dorsolateral syrinx that extends to the SDH in the C3-C6 spinal cord segments (corresponding to C2-C5 vertebrae). Estimated dorsal quadrant syrinx sizes based on the perpendicular diameters were between 2.5 and 9.5 times larger in dogs with phantom scratching, with the largest mean difference p-value being 0.009.
Conclusion: SM associated phantom scratching appears associated with MRI findings of a large syrinx extending into the mid cervical SDH. We hypothesise that damage in this region might influence the lumbosacral scratching central pattern generator (CPG). If a scratching SM affected dog does not have a large dorsolateral cervical syrinx with SDH involvement then alternative explanations for scratching should be investigated.},

Results-Intraventricular air and a fistula between the craniectomy site and ventricular system were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Prompt repair of the dural defect using prosthetic dura mater resulted in immediate regression of the neurological signs and cerebral spinal fluid rhinorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging repeated 8 weeks after surgery showed complete resolution of pneumocephalus.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Tension pneumocephalus is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of craniectomy that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. (C) Copyright 2002 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.},

	doi = {10.3390/vetsci10020150},
	abstract = {Simple Summary Fecal incontinence is a condition characterized by an inability to control defecation, due to either a failure of the large intestine to contain colorectal contents or a failure of the anal sphincter to resist the rectal propulsive forces. Surgical intervention is often necessary to treat severe cases. This study presents a modified semitendinosus muscle flap technique for anal sphincter augmentation in two canine patients with fecal incontinence: a 4-year-old mixed breed dog and a 19-year-old English Cocker Spaniel. The semitendinosus muscle was bifurcated and transposed around the anus. The resulting two muscle bundles completely encircled the anorectum, leading to a complete reconstruction of the external anal sphincter. Both dogs regained fecal continence following surgery. This new technique requires a shorter length of harvested muscle flap and is a relatively simple surgical procedure compared to conventional surgeries. So, it may be a viable surgical option for anal sphincter incontinence in dogs. A 4-year-old mixed breed dog and a 19-year-old English cocker spaniel dog were evaluated for fecal incontinence. The second dog's fecal incontinence was associated with the anal mass. In both dogs, reconstruction of the external anal sphincter was required to gain fecal continence. Especially in the dog with an anal mass, the whole musculature involved in fecal continence was removed with the affected anorectum. Conventional surgical treatments for fecal incontinence have limitations in terms of muscle flap length and complexity of the surgical procedure. A modified surgical technique using the semitendinosus muscle was devised in the present study to overcome these limitations. The distal part of the semitendinosus muscle was bifurcated to make two muscle bundles, used to completely encircle the anorectum. These muscle bundles were sutured to the surrounding rectal muscle and the pelvic diaphragm to simulate the function of the external anal sphincter. Three months after surgery, both dogs showed significantly improved fecal continence without severe complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or lameness of the limb where the semitendinosus muscle was harvested. The outcomes of the two dogs supported the acceptability of the bifurcated muscle flap for anal sphincter augmentation. In addition, this report showed the possibility of more diverse applications of semitendinosus muscle in dogs.},

	abstract = {Effect of Pimobendan or Benazepril Hydrochloride on survival times in dogs with congestive heart failure caused by naturally occuring myxomatous mitral valve disease: the QUEST study
Background: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in geriatric dogs despite conventional therapy.
Hypothesis: Pimobendan in addition to conventional therapy will extend time to sudden cardiac death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure when compared with conventional therapy plus benazepril in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) attributable to MMVD.
Animals: 260 client-owned dogs in CHF caused by MMVD were recruited from 28 centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia.
Methods: A prospective single-blinded study with dogs randomized to PO receive pimobendan (0.4-0.6 mg/kg/d) or benazepril hydrochloride (0.25-1.0 mg/kg/d). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, euthanized for heart failure, or treatment failure.
Results: Eight dogs were excluded from analysis. 124 dogs were randomized to pimobendan and 128 to benazepril. 190 dogs reached the primary endpoint; the median time was 188 days (267 days for pimobendan, 140 days for benazepril, hazard ratio = 0.688, 95\% confidence limits [CL] = 0.516-0.916, P = 0099). The benefit of pimobendan persisted after adjusting for all baseline variables. A longer time to reach the endpoint was also associated with being a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, requiring a lower furosemide dose, and having a higher creatinine concentration. Increases in several indicators of cardiac enlargement (left atrial to aortic root ratio, vertebral heart scale, and percentage increase in left ventricular internal diameter in systole) were associated with a shorter time to endpoint, as was a worse tolerance for exercise.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Pimobendan plus conventional therapy prolongs time to sudden death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure in dogs with CHF caused by MMVD compared with benazepril plus conventional therapy.},

	abstract = {Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening fungal disease that can occur in dogs. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary genetic characterisation of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. 'canis' (P. canis) in dogs and thereby develop a reliable molecular protocol to definitively diagnose canine PCP. We investigated P. canis in a variety of lung specimens from dogs with confirmed or strongly suspected PCP (Group 1, n = 16), dogs with non-PCP lower respiratory tract problems (Group 2, n = 65) and dogs not suspected of having PCP or other lower respiratory diseases (Group 3, n = 11). Presence of Pneumocystis DNA was determined by nested PCR of the large and small mitochondrial subunit rRNA loci and by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay developed using a new set of primers. Molecular results were correlated with the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes detected in cytological/histological prepa rations. Pneumocystis DNA was amplified from 13/16 PCP-suspected dogs (Group 1) and from 4/76 dogs of control Groups 2 and 3 (combined). The latter four dogs were thought to have been colonized by P. canis. Comparison of C-T values in 'infected' versus 'colonized' dogs was consistent with this notion, with a distinct difference in molecular burden between groups (C-T {\textless}= 26 versus C-T range (26 {\textless} C-T {\textless} 35), respectively). Phylogenetic analyses showed that P. canis is specifically 'canine' associated, being separated from other mammalian Pneumocystis species, thereby confirming the accuracy of qPCR amplicon for Pneumocystis in dogs. Using qPCR, Pneumocystis DNA can be detected in specimens from the respiratory tract and a C-T value can be interpreted to distinguish infection versus colonization.},

Objective: The purpose of this study was to establish canine hematologic reference intervals according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines using the Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzer.
Methods: Blood samples from 132 healthy purebred dogs from France, selected to represent the most prevalent canine breeds in France, were analyzed. Blood smears were scored for platelet (PLT) aggregates. Reference intervals were established using the nonparametric method. PLT and RBC counts obtained by impedance and optical methods were compared. Effects of sex and age on reference intervals were determined.
Results: The correlation between impedance (I) and optical (O) measurements of RBC and PLT counts was excellent (Pearson r =. 99 and .98, respectively); however, there were significant differences between the 2 methods (Student's paired t-test, P {\textless} .0001). Differences between sexes were not significant except for HCT, PLT-I, and PLT-O. WBC, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts decreased significantly with age (ANOVA, P {\textless} .05). Median eosinophil counts were higher in Brittany Spaniels (1.87 x 10(9)/L), Rottweilers (1.41 x 10(9)/L), and German Shepherd dogs (1.38 x 10(9)/L) than in the overall population (0.9 x 10(9)/L). PLT aggregates were responsible for lower PLT counts by the impedance, but not the optical, method.
Conclusion: Reference intervals for hematologic analytes and indices were determined under controlled preanalytical and analytical conditions for a well-characterized population of dogs according to international recommendations.},

The disease was also diagnosed in 33 other breeds, most commonly in crossbreeds, spaniels, small terriers and collies, and was more common in females. Detailed replies on 160 cases were returned; 79 dogs were alive and 41 dead, with the remainder lost to long term follow-up. The major reasons for death were euthanasia because of the cost, the prognosis, and failure to respond to treatment. An adequate response to treatment was obtained in 92 per cent of dogs. Uncoated preparations of pancreatic enzyme replacement were found to be more successful, and the use of dietary manipulation and antibiotics were frequently reported to be useful adjunctive therapies.},

Aspergillus niger together with Malassezia pachydermatis were the isolated, the oral and topical antifungal therapy was established with favorable results after 30 days of treatment. The isolated mold exhibited some important virulence factors such as hemolytic, lipase and amylase activity, as well as in vitro susceptibility to azole antifungals. In the immunosuppressed patients with otitis externa, it is necessary to perform microbiological cultures for environmental fungi, in addition to evaluating the pathogenic characteristic at the phenotypic level. This may help to establish a proper therapeutic approach and monitoring of liver enzymes for possible adverse effects.},

Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia represents a common condition in brachycephalic dogs, especially seen in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Griffon Bruxellois.
Before the appearance of the magnetic resonance imaging, diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation and/or syringomyelia has been frequently confused with various skin problems, especially allergic skin disorders, ear infections, epilepsy or discopathies. Thus, MRI is essential in diagnoses of Chiari-like malformation and/or syringomyelia, as well as of the extension of lesions and the occurrence of secondary complications.},

Older puppies had focal cartilage necrosis within lumbar vertebral epiphyses. At the cellular level, lesions were characterized by chondrocytic hypertrohy and lysosomal accumulation of storage compounds. Our studies illustrate that the skeletal lesions in both canine models are similar to those in a child with G(M1)-gangliosidosis.

To obtain overall properties of the composite, indentation of locations, selected from an optical microscopic image has been performed. Obtained results are compared with data, previously gained by the uni-axial compressive test. Elastic moduli, obtained locally by nanoindentation are higher, when compared with those, measured globally under compressive load. For the elastic modulus, the order of results, measured for particular materials, remains unchanged by various measurement methods and is equal to that of indentation hardness.},
