OBJECTIVES: The presence, age of onset,  characteristics and treatment of myoclonic episodes were retrospectively  evaluated in a cohort of CKCS which presented to 1 board-certified neurologist.  Clinical data, imaging studies, presence of seizures and their management, as  well as other comorbidities were noted. ANIMALS: Thirty-nine CKCS that were  presented to 2 institutions between 2001 and 2018 with signs consistent with  myoclonus. Clinical examination, blood sampling, advanced diagnostic imaging,  cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and record keeping of other comorbidities was  performed. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series, describing the presence  of myoclonus in CKCS. RESULTS: Clinical signs reported were spontaneous in onset,  lasted a few seconds and consisted of rapid blinking with head nodding and  variable extension down the thoracic limbs. Myoclonus occasionally led to  stumbling of the thoracic limbs or collapse. Mean age of onset was 8.38 years (SD  ±1.96). Thirteen of 39 dogs with myoclonus had paroxysmal events, such as  generalized seizures (9/13). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Myoclonus  occurs in middle-aged to older CKCS and seems to be another epiphenomena of this  breed. A link to epilepsy might be present.","2022-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1032-1038","","3","36","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Fitzpatrick Referrals Limited.

A large, bulging pars flaccida identified  on otoscopic examination confirms the diagnosis. However, in many CKCS with PSOM  the pars flaccida is flat, and radiographic imaging is needed to confirm the  diagnosis. Current treatment for PSOM includes performing a myringotomy into the  caudal-ventral quadrant of the pars tensa with subsequent flushing of the mucus  out of the bulla using a video otoscope. Repeat myringotomies and flushing of the  middle ear are necessary to keep the middle ear free of mucus.","2012-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1137-1142","","6","42","","Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the  prevalence of otitis externa (OE) in this breed remains unknown. We reviewed the  year 2010 medical records of 55 private veterinary clinics in Finland to  determine the prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels compared with English  Cocker and English and Welsh Springer Spaniels. An American Cocker Spaniel owner  questionnaire was designed to identify potential risk factors for end-stage OE.  RESULTS: From the medical records of 98,736 dogs, the prevalence of OE was  highest in Welsh Springer Spaniels (149 out of 468, 31.8%, [95% confidence  interval 27.6-36.0]), followed by American Cocker (89/329, 27.0%, [22.2-31.7]),  English Springer (96/491, 19.6%, [16.1-23.1]) and English Cocker Spaniels  (231/1467, 15.7%, [13.8-17.6]). The mean number of OE episodes in ear-diseased  dogs and the number of ear surgeries were highest in American Cocker Spaniels.  Owner questionnaires were received for 151 American Cocker Spaniels, 85 (56%) of  which had suffered from OE. In 47% (40/85) of these dogs, OE occurred without  concurrent skin lesions, 46% (33/72) displayed the first signs of OE before  1 year of age. In 24% (20/85) of the dogs, the signs of OE recurred within  1 month or continued despite treatment, 16% (14/85) required surgery (n = 11) or  were euthanized (n = 5; 2 of the operated dogs and 3 others) due to severe OE.  The onset of OE before the age of 1 year significantly increased the risk (OR  3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.6) of end-stage OE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OE in  American Cocker Spaniels in Finland was higher than previously reported in Cocker  Spaniels, but the highest prevalence of OE was found in Welsh Springer Spaniels.  Compared to the other Spaniels, OE was more often recurrent and more frequently  surgically managed in American Cocker Spaniels. Based on the questionnaire, early  onset (<1 year) of OE increased the risk of end-stage OE. In American Cocker  Spaniels, OE requires an intensive approach from the first treatment, and  prevention of recurrence should be emphasised. The causes and treatment of OE in  this breed warrant further study.","2017-02-28","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","14","","1","59","","Acta Vet Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28241842  PMCID: PMC5330127","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Recurrence; American Cocker Spaniel; Data Collection; Dog Diseases/drug therapy/*epidemiology/surgery; End-stage otitis externa; Finland/epidemiology; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Otitis externa; Otitis Externa/drug therapy/epidemiology/surgery/*veterinary; Owner questionnaire; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: Eight  client-owned ESSs with congenital MD referred for murmur investigation and/or  suspected congestive heart failure (CHF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective  case series. Medical records and echocardiograms were reviewed to collect  relevant data. Echocardiograms were assessed for the following abnormalities  consistent with MD: thickened valve leaflets or leaflet tips, a 'hockey stick'  appearance to the valve leaflets, abnormal length of one leaflet with respect to  the other, and tethering of one or both leaflets to the papillary muscles.  RESULTS: All eight dogs showed the typical echocardiographic lesions associated  with MD: thickened leaflet tips (5/8), 'hockey stick' appearance (5/8), elongated  anterior leaflet (4/8), tethering of one or both leaflets (7/8). Seven of the  eight dogs presented in CHF. Six of the eight dogs had left ventricular dilation  in both systole and diastole. Two of the eight dogs had reduced systolic function  as assessed by ejection fraction/fractional shortening; however end-systolic  volume index was increased in 6/8 dogs. Two dogs subsequently developed atrial  fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital MD should be considered in ESSs with a  left-sided apical systolic murmur, particularly in younger dogs. The valve  changes seen are similar to those reported in other breeds with MD (thickened  leaflet tips, hockey stick appearance to open leaflet tips, abnormal leaflet  tethering, abnormally shaped leaflets) and may result in marked remodeling and  CHF.","2021-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","52-60","","","33","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A syndrome similar to Brody disease has been reported in cattle.  Reports of a similar syndrome in dogs are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To define and  describe the clinical, diagnostic, and genetic features and disease course of  paradoxical pseudomyotonia in Spaniel dogs. ANIMALS: Seven client-owned dogs (4  English Springer Spaniels and 3 English Cocker Spaniels) with clinically  confirmed episodes of exercise-induced generalized myotonic-like muscle  stiffness. METHODS: Sequential case study. RESULTS: All dogs were <24 months of  age at onset. The episodes of myotonic-like generalized muscle stiffness always  occurred with exercise, and spontaneously resolved with rest in <45 seconds in  all but 1 dog. Extreme outside temperatures seemed to considerably worsen episode  frequency and severity in most dogs. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry  including electrolytes, urinalysis, brain magnetic resonance imaging,  cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electromyography, motor nerve conduction velocity,  ECG, and echocardiography were unremarkable. Muscle biopsy samples showed  moderate but nonspecific muscle atrophy. The episodes seemed to remain stable or  decrease in severity and frequency in 6/7 dogs, and often could be decreased or  prevented by avoiding the episode triggers. The underlying genetic cause is not  identified yet, because no disease-causing variants could be found in the coding  sequence or splice sites of the 2 major candidate genes, SCN4A and ATP2A1.  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Paradoxical pseudomyotonia is a disease  affecting Spaniels. It is of variable severity but benign in most cases.","2020-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","253-257","","1","34","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Authors.

Retrospectively, 43 client-owned Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels, older than 1 year of age, with magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of  Chiari-like malformation were enrolled. Initial and follow-up (up to 36 months)  clinical status was graded. Images were reviewed to quantify the enlargement of  lateral ventricles, evaluate ventricular symmetry, grade of Chiari-like  malformation, grade of syringomyelia and medullary kinking index. Cases  presenting epileptic seizures during the evaluation period were also recorded.  The most common initial clinical signs were scratching and neck pain.  Ventriculomegaly was identified in 70% of dogs, Chiari-like malformation grade 2  was observed in 77% of cases, ventricular asymmetry and syringomyelia were  identified in 54% and 80% of dogs, respectively; the median medullary kinking  index was 37.77%. Moreover, 28% of dogs presented epileptic seizures. No  significant association was identified between dimension of lateral ventricles  and signalment, clinical signs, and imaging findings; no significant association  was identified between ventriculomegaly and epilepsy (P≥0.05). In conclusion, the  prevalence of ventriculomegaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels is high but this  finding does not seem related to the severity of clinical signs, presence of  Chiari-like malformation, syringomyelia and craniocervical junction abnormalities  such as medullary kinking.","2022-09-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1185-1193","","9","84","","J Vet Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 35831130  PMCID: PMC9523300","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; dog; *Dog Diseases/pathology; *Hydrocephalus/veterinary; *Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/veterinary; cavalier king charles spaniels; Chiari-like; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Seizures/diagnostic imaging/veterinary; syringomyelia; ventriculomegaly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to  investigate the clinical signs, metabolic changes and underlying genetic defect.  Blood and urine organic acid analysis revealed increased medium-chain fatty acids  and together with the clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of medium-chain  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. We sequenced the genome of the affected  dog and compared the data to 923 control genomes of different dog breeds. The  ACADM gene encoding MCAD was considered the top functional candidate gene. The  genetic analysis revealed a single homozygous private protein-changing variant in  ACADM in the affected dog. This variant,  XM_038541645.1:c.444_445delinsGTTAATTCTCAATATTGTCTAAGAATTATG, introduces a  premature stop codon and is predicted to result in truncation of ~63% of the wild  type MCAD open reading frame, XP_038397573.1:p.(Thr150Ilefs*6). Targeted  genotyping of the variant in 162 additional CKCS revealed a variant allele  frequency of 23.5% and twelve additional homozygous mutant dogs. The  acylcarnitine C8/C12 ratio was elevated ~43.3 fold in homozygous mutant dogs as  compared to homozygous wild type dogs. Based on available clinical and  biochemical data together with current knowledge in humans, we propose the ACADM  frameshift variant as causative variant for the MCAD deficiency with likely  contribution to the neurological phenotype in the index case. Testing the CKCS  breeding population for the identified ACADM variant is recommended to prevent  the unintentional breeding of dogs with MCAD deficiency. Further prospective  studies are warranted to assess the clinical consequences of this enzyme defect.","2022-10-13","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","10","13","","Genes (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36292732  PMCID: PMC9601649","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Male; dog; *Codon, Nonsense; *Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics/veterinary; Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase/genetics; Canis lupus familiaris; Child, Preschool; fatty acid disorder; Fatty Acids; metabolism; neurology; precision medicine; seizure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A worldwide family  tree of more than 5,500 CKCSs spanning a maximum of 24 generations was  established by obtaining pedigree information from 120 dogs diagnosed with SM  secondary to occipital bone hypoplasia. The ongoing study showed 6 of 8 great  grandparents of all affected dogs could be traced back to 2 female ancestors so  that all 8 were descended from one or the other or both. The disease appears to  be more severe and have an earlier onset with increased inbreeding, especially  when breeding from affected dogs. The family tree of idiopathic epilepsy (IE)  appears to be a different subset of the CKCS population, although some overlap  was observed. Idiopathic epilepsy is more frequent in lines originating from  whole-color dogs. Selection for coat color is believed to have influenced the  development of both occipital hypoplasia with secondary SM and IE. In addition,  breeding guidelines to reduce the incidence of mitral valve disease have placed  further pressures on the gene pool.","2004-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","673-678","","5","18","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15515584","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/genetics/*veterinary; Bone Diseases, Developmental/genetics/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Epilepsies, Myoclonic/genetics/veterinary; Occipital Bone/*abnormalities; Pedigree; Syringomyelia/genetics/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This prospective and  retrospective, observational, analytical study aimed to describe quantitative CT  characteristics of the horizontal ear canal and the tympanic bulla in American  Cocker Spaniels versus similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs. We prospectively  performed clinical examinations and aural CT scanning for 38 American Cocker  Spaniels. Computed tomographic transverse area of the osseous horizontal ear  canal (TA1), transverse area of the widest air-filled part of the cartilaginous  horizontal ear canal (TA2), tympanic bulla volume, and tympanic bulla wall  thickness were measured. The TA1 and TA2 measurements were compared with those of  23 retrospectively recruited, similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs that had  undergone CT-scanning of the head for non-ear-related reasons. The TA1 and TA2  did not differ for healthy American Cocker Spaniels and mesaticephalic dogs.  Severely affected American Cocker Spaniels had significantly smaller TA2  (P < .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient for intraobserver and  interobserver repeatability was 0.972 and 0.983 for TA1 and 0.994 and 0.998 for  TA2, respectively. Variation between individuals was subjectively noted in  healthy and affected American Cocker Spaniels, but mean tympanic bulla volume was  slightly smaller in relation to body weight, and the tympanic bulla wall was  thicker than in previous reports for mesaticephalic dogs. The tympanic bulla wall  appeared thicker rostro-ventrally than caudo-ventrally in 44% of the dogs. Our  results imply that a relatively thick tympanic bulla wall may be a normal CT  variation and should be interpreted cautiously in this breed.","2020-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","649-658","","6","61","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 American College of Veterinary Radiology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32808397","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; canine; Pedigree; Craniosynostoses/diagnostic imaging/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging; Ear Canal/*diagnostic imaging; Ear, Middle/*diagnostic imaging; middle ear; otitis externa; Otitis Externa/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; otitis media; Otitis Media/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three  circulating microRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR30b-5p, and miR-128-3p) were measured by  quantitative real-time PCR using TaqMan® probes. Diagnostic performance was  evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).  MiR-30b-5p was significantly higher in ACVIM B1 dogs than in ACVIM A subjects,  and the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.79. According to the age of  dogs, the amount of miR-30b-5p was statistically significantly higher in group  B1<3y (2.3 folds, P = 0.034), B1 3-7y (2.2 folds, P = 0.028), and B1>7y (2.7  folds, P = 0.018) than in group A. The area under the receiver operating curves  were fair in discriminating between group B1<3y and group A (AUC 0.780), between  B1 3-7y and A (AUC 0.78), and good in discriminating between group B1>7y and A  (AUC 0.822). Identifying dogs with early asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valve  disease through the evaluation of miR-30b-5p represents an intriguing possibility  that certainly merits further research. Studies enrolling a larger number of dogs  with preclinical stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease are needed to expand  further and validate conclusively the preliminary findings from this report.","2022","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0266208","","7","17","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35816500  PMCID: PMC9273067","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Prospective Studies; *Dog Diseases; *Heart Valve Diseases/genetics/veterinary; *MicroRNAs/genetics; Biomarkers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Mitral Valve/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: A  nationwide ambidirectional case-control cohort study was performed in American  Cocker Spaniels that had an ophthalmic examination performed by a veterinarian.  Ninety-four dogs with PG (cases) and 111 dogs without glaucoma (controls) met  phenotypic criteria and had a blood sample collected after receiving informed  owner consent. PROCEDURES: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and  genotyped (CanineHD BeadChip, Illumina Inc). A case-control GWAS using a linear  mixed model was performed, and 3 significance thresholds were calculated (1)  using a Bonferroni correction on all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  included in the GWAS, (2) using a Bonferroni correction on only the unlinked SNPs  from a pruned data set, and (3) using 10,000 random phenotype permutations.  RESULTS: Following genotype data quality control, 89 cases and 93 controls were  included in the GWAS. We identified an association on canine chromosome (CFA10);  however, it did not reach statistical significance. Potential candidate genes  within the surrounding linkage disequilibrium interval include coiled-coil domain  containing 85A (CCDC85A) and extracellular growth factor containing fibulin  extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Primary glaucoma in  the American Cocker Spaniel is a complex heterogeneous disease that may be  influenced by a locus on CFA10. The candidate genes CCDC85A and EFEMP1 within the  identified linkage disequilibrium interval have been shown to be involved in  human open-angle glaucoma.","2022-10-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1-8","","11","83","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36170212","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; *Dog Diseases/genetics; *Glaucoma, Open-Angle/genetics/veterinary; *Glaucoma/genetics/veterinary; Case-Control Studies; Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study/veterinary; Genotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PROCEDURES: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to identify  healthy dogs ≥ 1 year old that had undergone an ECG. The Mann-Whitney U test or  the Student t test were used to compare continuous variables between male and  female dogs, whereas the χ2 test was used for categorical variables. Spearman  correlation coefficients between ECG measurements and age and body weight were  also calculated in the case of continuous variables, whereas the Kruskal-Wallis  test was used for categorical ones. RESULTS: Electrocardiographic parameters of  healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels overall fitted with traditional reference  intervals cited in textbooks; in contrast, 28% of Pugs and 20% of EBs showed a  shift of the QRS-complex mean electrical axis (QRS-MEA). In Pugs and EBs, the  mean/median QRS-MEA value was 56° (from 0° to 100°) and 59° (from 20° to 100°),  respectively. All axis shifts were left shifts (in Pugs, from 0° to 34°; in EBs,  20° to 39°). Only a few meaningful differences were found when comparing ECG  variables between males and females. Similarly, only 1 statistically significant  correlation was found between ECG parameters and age and body weight. CLINICAL  RELEVANCE: Healthy Pugs and EBs present a trend to a left shift of the QRS-MEA.

An increase in  age is generally associated with increased incidence of the disease, but Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) exhibit an unusually high prevalence of early-onset  MMVD, and thus, potentially greater cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to  other breeds. Previous research has suggested that selected candidate risk  alleles for MMVD are fixed in CKCSs, including six locations within the Nebulette  (NEBL) gene on CFA2. The current study analysed genotypes of 180 Australian CKCSs  at the identified risk loci. Of these, 178 were phenotyped for severity of  disease by echocardiographic measurements of left atrium to aortic root ratio  (LA:Ao) and weight normalised left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVIDdN).  Genotyping array markers correctly predicted the genotype at the risk-variant  loci in the CKCS population, and the NEBL1, NEBL2 and NEBL3 variants were  observed to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium in this cohort. The CKCS cohort  included 6/178 dogs being heterozygous for the protective/wild-type alleles at  the NEBL locus. The mean LA:Ao and LVIDdN scores of these dogs heterozygous at  NEBL1-3 variants were significantly smaller, and with significantly lower  variance compared to age-matched CKCSs that were homozygous for risk alleles. The  lower cardiac measurements in the heterozygous dogs indicate a significantly  reduced risk of severe MMVD disease. Our analysis suggests that despite relative  fixation of the NEBL risk alleles, healthy reference alleles at NEBL1-3 exist in  low frequency in the CKCS breed and can be used to reduce MMVD severity and  mortality.","2022-12-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","12","13","","Genes (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36553559  PMCID: PMC9778376","","","","Animals; Dogs; dog; Australia; *Heart Valve Diseases/genetics/veterinary; *Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/genetics; congestive heart failure; genetics; heart disease; Mitral Valve; myxomatous mitral valve disease; nebulette; Patient Acuity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This histopathological study used  spinal cords from CKCS dogs with syringomyelia to investigate the following  conditions: (1) whether specific structural cervical spinal cord entities  involved in nociception were affected by loss of neuroparenchyma or other  pathological changes in CKCS dogs with pain-related behaviour and phantom  scratching, (2) whether pain-related behaviour or phantom scratching correlated  with loss of a specific anatomical entity or upregulation of glia cells, and (3)  whether syringomyelia-related lesions affected specific functional spinal cord  units of nociception. Spinal cord segments C1-C8 from CKCS dogs with magnetic  resonance imaging-confirmed syringomyelia and clinical signs of pain and phantom  scratching (n = 8) were compared with those from CKCS dogs without syringomyelia  (n = 4). Dogs with unilateral scratching (n = 7) had a volume loss ( P = 0.043)  of the dorsal horn laminae I-III in the ipsilateral side compared with the  contralateral dorsal horn. A clear pattern of ipsilateral changes in the dorsal  root entry zone characterised by deafferentation and reorganization of  first-order axons into deeper laminae was found in cases with lateralised  scratching. Significant changes in cell number density were not found for  astrocytes or microglia, suggesting that the dogs represented cases of end-stage  syringomyelia and thus could not reveal astrogliosis and microgliosis, which may  be involved in the early phases of syrinx development and phantom scratching. The  present relationship between clinical findings and dorsal horn and pain pathway  pathology in CKCS dogs suggests that these dogs may be of interest as a  supplement to experimental model pain research.","2022-12-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2365-2379","","12","163","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 International Association for the Study of Pain.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35353770","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; *Dog Diseases/diagnosis/pathology; *Neuralgia/diagnostic imaging; *Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/pathology/veterinary; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vertebral heart size  (VHS), vertebral left atrial size (VLAS), modified VLAS (M-VLAS), and  radiographic left atrial dimension (RLAD) are reported as objective measurements  of global heart size and left atrial size. Normal VHS in CKCS (10.6 ± 0.5) is  reportedly higher than the non-breed-specific value (9.7±0.5). Breed-specific  VLAS, M-VLAS, and RLAD cut-offs have not been reported in CKCS. The aim of this  prospective reference interval study was to describe the VHS, VLAS, M-VLAS, and  RLAD values for 30 clinically healthy adult CKCS. Inclusion criteria were  unremarkable physical examination, normal echocardiography, and thoracic  radiographs without malposition/abnormalities. There were 22 female and eight  male dogs. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years. The VHS mean value in our sample was  10.08 ± 0.56 (95% range, 9.87-10.29). This was significantly greater than a  previously published general canine reference value of 9.7 ± 0.5 and  significantly less than a previously published CKCS breed-specific value of  10.6 ± 0.5 (P < 0.01).

The clinical importance of these SNPs is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To  investigate whether SNPs in NR3C1a are associated with clinical outcome in Cocker  Spaniels with primary immune thrombocytopenia (pITP). ANIMALS: Twenty-four Cocker  Spaniels with pITP presented to a referral center. Dogs were classified as slow  (n = 11) or fast responders (n = 12) based on time required after initiating  glucocorticoid treatment to achieve a platelet count >70 000/μL. METHODS:  Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from stored blood samples before  amplification by PCR and sequencing of exons 2 and 8 of NR3C1a. Associations  between genotype and clinical response variables were investigated. RESULTS:  Neither previously identified nonsynonymous SNPs were identified. The synonymous  SNP NR3C1a:c.798C>T in exon 2 was found at an increased prevalence compared to a  previous report.

We hypothesised that within the  elderly CKCS population, there is a sub-cohort of MMVD-affected dogs that do not  have cardiac remodelling. The objectives of the present study were (i) to  determine the prevalence and the degree of cardiac remodelling associated with  MMVD; and (ii) assess the effect of age, gender, and body weight on  echocardiographic status in a population of aged CKCSs. A total of 126 CKCSs ≥ 8  years old were prospectively included. They all had a physical and  echocardiographic examination. A systolic murmur was detected in 89% of dogs; the  presence of clinical signs was reported in 19% of them; and echocardiographic  evidence of MMVD was described in 100%. Despite the high prevalence, 44.4% of the  dogs were clear of echocardiographic signs of cardiac remodelling. Age was  significantly associated with the presence and severity of cardiac remodelling  and mitral valve prolapse.

This preliminary pilot study aimed to (1)  describe the clinical and echocardiographic parameters of Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease at different American  College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stages (B1, B2 and C) and healthy  control group (ACVIM A), comparing the parameters collected during the first  examination (T0) and the end of the follow-up (T1); (2) assess the association  between the values of echocardiographic parameters at T1 and the expression  profile of miR-30b-5p at T0. Thirty-five Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (median  age 4.29 years and median weight 9 Kg) in different ACVIM stages were included (7  A, 19 B1, 6 B2 and 3 C). Inverse probability weighting analysis was performed to  estimate the association of the exposure variable (miR-30b-5p) with the outcome  variables (clinical and echocardiographic variables). Time was included as  variable. The results pointed out that high levels of plasma miR-30b-5p  corresponded to lower values of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter  normalized for body weight, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexed for  body weight, and left atrium-to aortic root ratio. Hence, higher miR-30b-5p  expressions were associated with milder forms of mitral valve disease in our  study population. In contrast, the results obtained for the intensity of heart  murmur, the mitral regurgitation severity, and the Mitral INsufficiency  Echocardiographic score) were not statistically significant. A relationship  between high abundance of miR-30b-5p and myxomatous mitral valve disease that  appear echocardiographically more stable over time has been demonstrated. In  conclusion, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve  disease that at the first cardiologic evaluation showed an upregulation of  miR-30b-5p are expected to experience lesser variations on their  echocardiographic examination between T0 and T1.","2022","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0274724","","12","17","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2022 Ghilardi et al.

Currently there are no  data on the position of the caudal spinal cord structures in CKCS. OBJECTIVE: To  describe and compare location of spinal cord termination in CKCS with  weight-matched controls and to examine the relationship between SM and spinal  cord termination. ANIMALS: Thirty-nine CKCS and 33 controls with thoracolumbar  MRIs; 34 of 39 CKCS also had cervical MRIs. METHODS: Blinded retrospective study.  Spinal cord and dural sac termination were determined from T2-weighted sagittal  and transverse images and half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo  sequences. Intra-observer reliability was determined using kappa analysis.  Presence of SM was compared with location of spinal cord and dural sac  termination.

Von Frey aesthesiometry (VFA) is a method of mechanical quantitative  sensory testing that provides an objective sensory threshold (ST) value and can  be used to quantify neuropathic pain (NP) and monitor response to therapy. The  utility of VFA has been previously established in client-owned dogs with acute  spinal cord injury but the technique has not been evaluated in dogs with SM. The  goal of this study was to evaluate ST, as determined by VFA, in dogs with and  without SM, to assess the utility of VFA in quantifying NP in SM-affected dogs.  We hypothesized the SM-affected CKCS would have lower ST values, consistent with  hyperesthesia, when compared to control CKCS. Additionally, we hypothesized that  ST values in SM-affected dogs would be inversely correlated with syrinx size on  MRI and with owner-derived clinical sign scores. RESULTS: ST values for the  thoracic and pelvic limbs differed significantly between the SM-affected and  control CKCS (p = 0.027; p = 0.0396 respectively). Median ST value (range) for  the thoracic limbs was 184.1 g (120.9-552) for control dogs, and 139.9 g  (52.6-250.9) for SM-affected dogs. The median ST value (range) for the pelvic  limbs was 164.9 g (100.8-260.3) in control dogs and 129.8 g (57.95-168.4) in  SM-affected dogs. The ST values in SM-affected dogs did not correlate with syrinx  height on MRI (r = 0.314; p = 0.137). Owner-reported clinical sign scores showed  an inverse correlation with pelvic limb ST values, where dogs with lower ST  values (hyperesthesia) were reported by their owners to display more frequent and  severe clinical signs (r = - 0.657; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: ST values were lower  in SM-affected CKCS compared to control dogs, suggesting the presence of  neuropathic pain. Dogs with lower ST pelvic limb values were perceived by their  owners to have more severe clinical signs classically associated with SM. Our  results suggest that VFA might offer quantitative assessment of neuropathic pain  in SM-affected dogs and could be useful for monitoring response to therapy in  future clinical studies.","2020-03-20","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","94","","1","16","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32197618  PMCID: PMC7085174","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Cavalier King Charles spaniel; Chiari-like malformation; Dog Diseases/*physiopathology; Neuralgia/diagnosis/veterinary; Neuropathic pain; Quantitative sensory testing; Sensory Thresholds/*physiology; Syringomyelia; Syringomyelia/veterinary; von Frey aesthesiometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. ANIMALS: 81  English Cocker Spaniels and 81 Dachshunds with IVDEs. PROCEDURES: Signalment,  clinical signs, neurologic examination findings, and affected intervertebral disk  spaces (IVDSs) were recorded for both breeds. Management methods and outcomes  were recorded for English Cocker Spaniels. Lesions were categorized as  thoracolumbar (IVDSs T9-10 through L1-2), midlumbar (L2-3 through L4-5), or  caudal lumbar (L5-6 through L7-S1). RESULTS: Midlumbar and caudal lumbar IVDEs  were significantly more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds.  English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDEs had a longer median duration of  clinical signs before evaluation and more commonly had unilateral pelvic limb  lameness or spinal hyperesthesia as the predominant clinical sign than did those  with IVDEs at other sites. Those with caudal lumbar IVDEs less commonly had  neurologic deficits and had a higher median neurologic grade (indicating lesser  severity), shorter mean postoperative hospitalization time, and faster mean time  to ambulation after surgery than those with other sites affected. These variables  did not differ between English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar and midlumbar  IVDEs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Caudal and midlumbar IVDEs were more  common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds.

We performed  video-otoscopic examinations and dermatological work-up on 28 ACSs, obtained  aural biopsies from each dog and assessed the statistical associations between  the presence of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia and disease history,  clinical or microbiological findings and underlying cause of otitis externa (OE).  Histological lesions of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia were observed in  aural biopsies from 6/13 clinically healthy ears and 13/15 ears with OE from  19/28 examined dogs. Nine of 28 dogs had histologically normal ceruminous glands  (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-36.6). Bacterial growth in  microbiological culture of aural exudate (OR 14.1, 95% CI 2.1-95.3) was  associated with ceruminous glandular changes, whereas previous history of OE,  cutaneous findings or underlying allergies were not. Pedigree analysis and a  genome-wide association study (GWAS) were performed on 18 affected and eight  unaffected dogs based on histopathological diagnosis. While the GWAS indicated a  tentative, but not statistically significant, association of ceruminous gland  hyperplasia and ectasia with chromosome 31, a larger cohort is needed to confirm  this preliminary result. Based on our results, ceruminous gland hyperplasia and  ectasia may also precede clinical signs of OE in ACSs and a genetic aetiological  component is likely Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to verify  our preliminary results.","2021-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","30-44","","","185","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Thus, the  identification of dogs with a morphotype associated with more severe mitral  disease at a young age is desirable. The aims of this study were to: (1) describe  the physical, morphometric, and echocardiographic features of class B1  MMVD-affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) according to the American  College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines; (2) evaluate the  influence of morphometric physical measurements on murmur intensity, mitral valve  prolapse (MVP), regurgitant jet size, and indexed mitral valve and annulus  measurements. Fifty-two MMVD-affected CKCS were included in the ACVIM class B1.  This is a prospective clinical cross-sectional study. Morphometric measurements,  which included the body, thorax, and head sizes of each dog, were investigated to  establish the association with heart murmur intensity, valvular and annular  echocardiographic measurements, MVP, and regurgitant jet size, using inverse  probability weighting (IPW) analyses to adjust for confounding. The IPW analyses  showed that when the head length and nose length decreased, dogs had a more  severe regurgitant jet size. Furthermore, subjects with a more pronounced head  stop angle had thicker anterior mitral valve leaflets. A brachycephalic  morphotype, as seen in dogs similar to the King Charles Spaniel breed in terms of  cephalic morphology, is associated with a more severe regurgitant jet size and  with valvular characteristics that are related to the most severe forms of MMVD.","2021-09-23","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","10","8","","Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 34679035  PMCID: PMC8538534","","","","dog; myxomatous mitral valve disease; anterior mitral valve leaflet; echocardiography; canine morphometry; CKCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have  suggested a polygenic inheritance of the disease in this breed and revealed an  association with regions on canine chromosomes 13 and 14. Following clinical and  echocardiographic examinations, 33 not-directly-related CKCSs were selected and  classified as cases (n = 16) if MMVD was present before 5 years of age or as  controls (n = 17) if no or very mild MMVD was present after 5 years of age. DNA  was extracted from whole blood and genotyped with a Canine 230K SNP BeadChip  instrument. Cases and controls were compared with three complementary genomic  analyses (Wright's fixation index-F(ST), cross-population extended haplotype  homozygosity-XP-EHH, and runs of homozygosity-ROH) to identify differences in  terms of heterozygosity and regions of homozygosity. The top 1% single-nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and mapped, and the genes were thoroughly  investigated. Ten consensus genes were found localized on chromosomes 3-11-14-19,  partially confirming previous studies. The HEPACAM2, CDK6, and FAH genes, related  to the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway and heart development, also  emerged in the ROH analysis. In conclusion, this work expands the knowledge of  the genetic basis of MMVD by identifying genes involved in the early onset of  MMVD in CKCSs.","2020-10-16","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","10","10","","Animals (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 33081147  PMCID: PMC7602727","","","","genetics; cardiology; cavalier King Charles spaniel; dogs; mitral valve disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cocker spaniels were more likely to have humeral condylar fractures (HCFs) than other breeds (P <  .001). Male cocker spaniels were at increased risk (P < .001). Cocker spaniels  had more bilateral HCFs than other breeds of dogs (P < .001). Eighteen dogs (17  purebred spaniels and 1 crossbred spaniel) with HCFs of unknown cause or  occurring with normal activity were further studied, using radiography of their  humeral condyle bilaterally (n = 18), computed tomography (n = 3), biopsy (n =  2), bone scintigraphy (n = 2), and genetic evaluation (n = 8). Fourteen of these  18 dogs had a nonfractured contralateral condyle. Twelve (86%) of the 14  nonfractured humeral condyles had a radiolucent line within the center of the  condyle, 13 (93%) had radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease and an  abnormal medial coronoid process, and six (43%) had periosteal proliferation  involving the lateral epicondyle. Examination of biopsy samples from the fracture  sites of two cocker spaniels showed fibrous tissue present at the fracture  surfaces. The results of this study suggest an association between incomplete  ossification of the humeral condyle in cocker spaniels and Brittany spaniels and  a high prevalence of HCFs.

Data are  lacking on the clinical relevance of alterations in their spinal cord terminal  structures. OBJECTIVES: To compare spinal cord termination level and filum  terminale internum length (FTIL) with presence of lumbar SM and clinical signs in  CKCS. ANIMALS: Forty-eight CKCS. METHODS: In this prospective study, pain was  quantified using owner and clinician assessments. Vertebral level of spinal cord  and dural sac termination, presence of SM, and FTIL were determined from sagittal  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Kappa and intraclass correlation  (ICC) analyses determined interobserver reliability. The MRI findings were  compared to owner and clinician-reported pain quantification. RESULTS:  Interobserver reliability was good for spinal cord and dural sac termination  (kappa = 0.61 and 0.64, respectively) and excellent for FTIL (ICC: 92%  agreement). The spinal cord terminated at 6th lumbar vertebra in 1, 7th lumbar  vertebra in 31, and the sacrum in 15 dogs, and termination level was associated  with lumbar SM (P = .002) but not clinical signs.

An association between  spinal cord parenchymal lesions and specific clinical signs (e.g. spontaneous and  evoked scratching, withdrawal, and paroxysmal pain manifestations with  vocalisation) has been suggested. This led to the hypothesis that mechanical  sensory threshold is altered in clinical cases. The aim of this study was to  quantify the cervical mechanical sensory threshold using Semmes-Weinstein  monofilaments in nine Cavalier King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like  malformation and assumed syringomyelia-associated central neuropathic pain  compared to eight control dogs. Clinical and neurological examination including  magnetic resonance imaging was undertaken. Mean mechanical sensory threshold was  not significantly different between case and control dogs (t-test on log10  transformed data; P=0.25). Substantial variation within and between dogs was  seen, with individual thresholds ranging from 0.04 to 26g in case dogs and from  0.02 to 10g in control dogs. Based on these results, it is unlikely that Cavalier  King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia have  increased mechanical sensation characterised by lower mechanical sensory  threshold when quantified with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Whether clinical  cases experience central neuropathic pain remains unknown. The assessment of  sensory function in dogs with assumed central neuropathic pain should be  multimodal and include not only mechanical but also tactile and thermal threshold  quantification. The use of threshold quantification in a clinical setting is  challenging due to an insufficient signal relative to the biological background  noise within and between dogs.","2019-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","92-97","","","246","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

As a consequence, specific diseases are now prevalent in certain breeds, but  whether the recent breeding practice led to an overall increase in genetic load  remains unclear. Here we generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 20 dogs  per breed from eight breeds and document a ~10% rise in the number of derived  alleles per genome at evolutionarily conserved sites in the heavily bottlenecked  cavalier King Charles spaniel breed (cKCs) relative to in most breeds studied  here. Our finding represents the first clear indication of a relative increase in  levels of deleterious genetic variation in a specific breed, arguing that recent  breeding practices probably were associated with an accumulation of genetic load  in dogs. We then use the WGS data to identify candidate risk alleles for the most  common cause for veterinary care in cKCs-the heart disease myxomatous mitral  valve disease (MMVD). We verify a potential link to MMVD for candidate variants  near the heart specific NEBL gene in a dachshund population and show that two of  the NEBL candidate variants have regulatory potential in heart-derived cell lines  and are associated with reduced NEBL isoform nebulette expression in papillary  muscle (but not in mitral valve, nor in left ventricular wall). Alleles linked to  reduced nebulette expression may hence predispose cKCs and other breeds to MMVD  via loss of papillary muscle integrity.","2021-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e1009726","","9","17","","PLoS Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34473707  PMCID: PMC8412370","","","","Animals; Dog Diseases/*genetics; *Genetic Variation; *Mutation; Alleles; Dogs/*genetics; Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; Gene Expression; Heart Valve Diseases/genetics/*veterinary; Mitral Valve/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estimation of heritability was done in a  Bayesian analysis (facilitated by the MCMCglmm package of R) of refractive error  in a model, including terms for sex and coat color.

Several DLA haplotypes have been associated with autoimmune disease, including  IMHA, in dogs, and breed specific differences have been identified. Cytotoxic T  lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a critical molecule involved in the regulation of  T-cell responses. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CTLA4 promoter  have been shown to be associated with several autoimmune diseases in humans and  more recently with diabetes mellitus and hypoadrenocorticism in dogs. The aim of  the present study was to investigate whether DLA-DQB1 alleles or CTLA4 promoter  variability are associated with risk of IMHA in Cocker spaniels. RESULTS: There  were a restricted number of DLA-DQB1 alleles identified, with a high prevalence  of DLA-DQB1*007:01 in both groups. A high prevalence of DLA-DQB1 homozygosity was  identified, although there was no significant difference between IMHA cases and  controls. CTLA4 promoter haplotype diversity was limited in Cocker spaniels, with  all dogs expressing at least one copy of haplotype 8. There was no significant  difference comparing haplotypes in the IMHA affected group versus control group  (p = 0.23). Homozygosity for haplotype 8 was common in Cocker spaniels with IMHA  (27/29; 93 %) and in controls (52/63; 83 %), with no statistically significant  difference in prevalence between the two groups (p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: DLA-DQB1  allele and CTLA4 promoter haplotype were not found to be significantly associated  with IMHA in Cocker spaniels. Homozygosity for DLA-DQB1*007:01 and the presence  of CTLA4 haplotype 8 in Cocker spaniels might increase overall susceptibility to  IMHA in this breed, with other genetic and environmental factors involved in  disease expression and progression.","2015","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","8","","","2","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26401336  PMCID: PMC4579385","","","","Cocker spaniel; Cytotoxic-T-Lymphocyte-Antigen-4 (CTLA4); Dog Leukocyte Antigen (DLA); Immune Mediated Haemolytic Anaemia (IMHA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: Morphometric analysis of facial anatomy and dysmorphia in  CM-associated pain (CM-P) and syringomyelia (SM) in the Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel (CKCS). ANIMALS: Sixty-six client-owned CKCS. METHODS: Retrospective  study of anonymized T2W sagittal magnetic resonance imaging of 3 clinical groups:  (1) 11 without central canal dilation (ccd) or SM (CM-N), (2) 15 with CM-P with  no SM or <2 mm ccd (CM-P), and (3) 40 with syrinx width ≥4 mm (SM-S).  Morphometric analysis assessed rostral skull flattening and position of the hard  and soft palate relative to the cranial base in each clinical group and compared  CKCS with and without SM-S. RESULTS: Sixteen of 28 measured variables were  associated to SM-S compared to CM-N and CM-P. Of these 6 were common to both  groups. Predictive variables determined by discriminant analysis were (1) the  ratio of cranial height with cranial length (P < .001 between SM-S and CM-N) and  (2) the distance between the cerebrum and the frontal bone (P < .001 between SM-S  and CM-P). CM-P had the lowest mean height of the maxillary area. CONCLUSIONS AND  CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: CKCS with CM-P and SM-S have cranial brachycephaly with  osseous insufficiency in the skull with rostral flattening and increased  proximity of the hard and soft palate to the cranial base. Changes are greatest  with CM-P. These findings have relevance for understanding disease pathogenesis  and for selection of head conformation for breeding purposes.","2020-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","237-246","","1","34","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Authors.

People suffer from a similar  condition and describe numerous sensory abnormalities. Sensory changes have not  been quantified in affected CKCS. OBJECTIVES: To use quantitative sensory testing  (QST) to quantify thermal and mechanical thresholds in CKCS and to compare QST in  dogs with and without syringomyelia (SM). ANIMALS: Forty-four CKCS. METHODS:  Prospective study. Dogs underwent neurological examinations and craniocervical  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thermal testing was performed over the humerus  and thorax (n = 32); mechanical testing was performed on the paw and neck  (n = 44). Latencies, thresholds, and response rates were compared with presence  and severity of SM on MRI, presence of pain reported by the owner and pain  identified on examination. RESULTS: Thirty dogs had SM, 30 were painful on  examination, 29 were owner-reported symptomatic. Thermal and mechanical variables  were not significantly different based on presence or severity of SM. Dogs with  pain on examination had decreased mechanical thresholds on the paw (0.38 kg, SD =  0.18) and neck (2.05 kg, SD = 0.74) compared to thresholds of dogs without pain  on examination on the paw (0.60 kg, SD = 0.30) and neck (2.72 kg, SD = 0.57; P  = .021). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Mechanical and thermal sensitivity  does not appear to be related to the presence of SM, but mechanical sensitivity  appears to be related to the presence of pain and clinical signs. Mechanical  testing may be useful for assessing sensory abnormalities during clinical trials.","2018-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2021-2028","","6","32","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 The Authors.

The cause is unknown. In humans, different causes of pancreatitis have histologically distinct  appearances. The histopathologic lesions in English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) with CP  were noted to be histologically different than those of other breeds with CP.  HYPOTHESIS: CP in ECS is distinct from CP in other breeds and is characterized by  a duct destruction similar to what is observed in autoimmune CP of humans.  ANIMALS: Eight ECS and 9 other breeds with histologically confirmed CP recruited  over an 8-year period and 50 postmortem control dogs with CP. METHODS: Clinical,  clinicopathological, and ultrasonographic findings were recorded. Histological  sections were compared with a normal dog and 59 dogs of other breeds with CP.  Immunohistochemistry using anti-CD3, anti-CD79a, and anti-cytokeratin antibodies  was used to evaluate distribution and type of lymphocytic inflammation and  appearance of pancreatic ducts. RESULTS: Four male and 4 female ECS presented at  a mean age of 7.2 years. Clinical signs were similar in ECS and other breeds. The  pancreas was enlarged and hypoechoic in 4 ECS and 2 controls. Histopathology was  characterized by interlobular and periductular fibrosis and inflammation in ECS  compared with intralobular disease in most other breeds. Immunohistochemistry  identified prominent anti-CD3(+) lymphocytic infiltrates around venules and ducts  and a marked absence of interlobular ducts in ECS compared with mixed T-cell  infiltration and ductular hyperplasia in most other breeds with CP. CONCLUSIONS  AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: CP in ECS is distinct from CP in other breeds and is  notably duct destructive.","2011-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","797-804","","4","25","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21689157","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Cohort Studies; Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*pathology; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Pancreatitis, Chronic/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/pathology/*veterinary; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In comparison to dogs of other breeds (non-ESS) presenting for pacemaker  implantation, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), the outcome and survival of ESS were  investigated. METHODS: Case records of dogs receiving pacemaker implantation were  retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Between September 2004 and October 2008, 58  dogs were presented to the Small Animal Teaching Hospital, University of  Liverpool for pacemaker implantation. ESS (n=10) was the second most commonly  presented breed. ESS were significantly younger than non-ESS (P=0.022). cTnI  values were elevated on presentation and a significant reduction was present  after pacemaker implantation (P=0.008) in all dogs. No significant difference in  initial cTnI was identified comparing ESS and non-ESS (P=0.45) and median  survival times were similar (P=0.37). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: ESS may be  predisposed to bradyarrhythmias requiring pacemaker implantation. They present at  a significantly younger age than non-ESS. Survival times between ESS and non-ESS  were similar, despite ESS being paced at a younger age. However, pacemaker  implantation is recommended in ESS, as median survival times of 30 months with a  good quality of life were achieved.","2010-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","155-161","","3","51","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20070495","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Pedigree; Age Factors; Bradycardia/blood/mortality/therapy/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/blood/*mortality/*therapy; Pacemaker, Artificial/*veterinary; Time Factors; Troponin I/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PRA was suspected on ophthalmic examination  before and after surgery, and/or after electroretinography (ERG) was performed.  Visual outcome was assessed by menace response per eye at seven time periods  post-surgery (P1= 25-90 days, P2 = 91-180 days, P3 = 181-364 days,  P4 = 365-549 days, P5 = 550-729 days, P6 = 730-1094 days, and P7 ≥ 1095 days).  Descriptive statistics were performed. Generalized estimating equations were used  to identify predictors associated with vision after surgery. Odds ratio and  confidence intervals were reported. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Owners were  invited to participate in a questionnaire. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was  performed in 85 eyes. Median age at surgery was 9.09 years (min. 2.17 years, max.  13.49 years). At all re-examinations, up to and including P5, significantly more  eyes were visual than before surgery (P ≤ 0.003).

These features are  also found in human autoimmune pancreatitis type 1, part of a  glucocorticoid-responsive, multiorgan syndrome, newly recognized as IgG4-related  disease (IgG4-RD). Human IgG4-RD affects one or several organs, often showing a  predominance of IgG4(+) plasma cells histologically, with an IgG4(+):total IgG(+)  plasma cell ratio of >40%. This study investigated whether ECSs with CP and/or  inflammatory disease in several organs show an increase in IgG4(+) plasma cells  within affected tissues. Histological sections of pancreas, liver, kidney,  salivary gland and conjunctiva were obtained from ECSs with idiopathic chronic  inflammatory disease affecting those tissues. Tissue samples from age-matched  dogs of other breeds with similar diseases were also sampled. Control diseased  tissue samples, from dogs without a suspected immune-mediated disease, were  included. A subset of ECSs and dogs of other breeds presented with disease in  more than one organ. Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary reagents  detecting total IgG and three of the four canine IgG subclasses (IgG2, IgG3 and  IgG4). Normal sections of pancreas and liver showed an absence of labelled plasma  cells of any subclass. Normal kidney and salivary gland sections showed the  presence of a few labelled plasma cells (<10 plasma cells/high-power field).  Fourteen tissue sections from 12 ECSs and seven sections from six dogs of other  breeds showed elevated numbers of IgG4(+) plasma cells and IgG4(+):IgG(+) ratios  >40%. Individual dogs (ECSs and other breeds) showed marked increases in IgG4(+)  cells. There were no significant differences in the number of IgG4(+) plasma  cells between ECSs and dogs of other breeds for affected pancreas, liver,  salivary glands and conjunctiva. Kidney sections had more IgG4(+) cells, for both  ECSs and dogs of other breeds, than did sections from other organs. Dogs of other  breeds had significantly more IgG4(+) plasma cells in affected kidneys than ECSs.  In conclusion, several ECSs and dogs of other breeds fulfilled the histological  criteria for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, supporting the existence of a multiorgan  immune-mediated disease in ECSs and some dogs of other breeds.","2020-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","18-33","","","177","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to characterize  similarities and differences in the prevalence and formation of CAT in these  separately bred color variants of English Cocker Spaniels. MATERIALS: The study  was based on the veterinary records for presumed inherited eye diseases of 1232  English Cocker Spaniels which were provided by the German panel of the European  Eye Scheme for diagnosis of inherited eye diseases in animals (DOK,  <http://www.dok-vet.de>). Data included information on 615 single-colored and 617  multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. RESULTS: CAT was diagnosed in 92 (14.96%)  of the single-colored and 34 (5.51%) of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels.  The pedigree of the single-colored English Cocker Spaniels included 40  ophthalmologically examined dogs with 18 unaffected and 22 affected dogs. The  pedigree of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels contained 16  ophthalmologically examined dogs with 11 unaffected and five affected dogs.  CONCLUSIONS: In both color variants of the English Cocker Spaniels different  forms of primary CAT with respect to location within the lens occurred among  close relatives. Appearance of CAT was very heterogeneous without obvious sex  differences. The sample pedigrees do not support the assumption of familial  segregation of specific forms of primary CAT in English Cocker Spaniels.","2008-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","215-221","","4","11","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18638346","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Prevalence; Pedigree; Germany/epidemiology; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/*genetics; Cataract/epidemiology/genetics/*veterinary; Hair Color/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A  proposed aetiology of OME is inflammation of the middle ear mucosa, usually due  to bacterial infection, leading to auditory tube dysfunction.  HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to characterize the microbiological and  cytological findings of otic exudates from the external ear canal (EEC) (n = 68)  and middle ear (ME) (n = 69) from 41 CKCSs with PSOM. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Swab  samples from the EEC and mucus aspirated from the ME after performing a  myringotomy were obtained for bacterial culture and cytological analysis.  RESULTS: Fifty-five of 68 (81%) EEC and 46 of 69 (67%) ME yielded no bacterial  growth. Thirty-eight of the 68 (56%) ears had no microbial growth from neither  the EEC nor ME; seven (10%) had bacteria isolated from the EEC only; 17 (25%) had  bacteria isolated from the ME only, and six (8%) had bacteria isolated from both  EEC and ME. Thirty-four total bacterial isolates were cultured from ME. The most  common bacterial species isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed  by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Otic cytology identified coccoid organisms in  only three of 68 EEC and four of 69 ME. CONCLUSIONS: The role of bacteria in the  pathogenesis of PSOM in CKCS is unclear. The majority of the EEC and ME of the  CKCS with PSOM were negative by conventional bacterial culture and the  cytological presence of bacteria was not correlated with culture positives. The  potential role of noncultivable microbiota in PSOM requires exploration using  molecular methods.","2019-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","151-e44","","2","30","","Vet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 ESVD and ACVD.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30644141","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*microbiology; Ear, Middle/*microbiology; Exudates and Transudates/*cytology/*microbiology; Otitis Media with Effusion/microbiology/*veterinary; Otitis Media/microbiology/*veterinary; Staphylococcus/isolation & purification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) are frequently  affected with MMVD and appear to have different disease progression compared to  other dogs. This study aimed to determine if CKCS are more likely to develop PH  as a result of MMVD than dogs of other breeds. A secondary aim was to explore  whether breed or PH impacted survival. ANIMALS: A total of 187 dogs diagnosed  with MMVD, 94 CKCS and 93 non-CKCS, were included in this study. METHODS: This is  a retrospective review of dogs with MMVD. Data were analyzed for presence of PH,  congestive heart failure (CHF) and echocardiographic variables including the  ratio between mitral E wave velocity (E vel) and isovolumic relaxation time  (E/IVRT) and were compared between CKCS/non-CKCS and dogs with/without PH.  Survival analysis was also performed. RESULTS: American College of Veterinary  Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage (p < 0.001), CKCS (p = 0.005), left  atrium-to-aortic ratio (LA/Ao) (p < 0.001), E vel (p < 0.001) and log(10)(E/IVRT)  (p < 0.001) were significant at the univariate level for PH development. At the  multivariate level, only ACVIM stage remained significant (p = 0.044), suggesting  that worsening MMVD was the predominant determinant of PH development in this  study. Pulmonary hypertension was associated with greater likelihood of CHF  (p < 0.001) and death (both cardiac [p < 0.001] and all-cause mortality  [p = 0.011]). Cavalier King Charles spaniels were more likely to experience  cardiac death than non-CKCS (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, development  of PH was associated with worse MMVD, according to ACVIM stage.","2019-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","21-31","","","23","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is particularly common in the Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel (CKCS) breed and affected dogs are frequently managed with  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). We have previously identified a  canine ACE gene polymorphism associated with a decrease in angiotensin-converting  enzyme (ACE) activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate for the prevalence  of the ACE polymorphism in CKCS with mitral valve disease and to determine  whether the presence of the polymorphism is associated with alterations in ACE  activity at different stages of cardiac disease. METHODS: Seventy-three dogs with  a diagnosis of mitral valve disease were evaluated and a blood sample was drawn  for ACE polymorphism genotyping and ACE activity measurement. RESULTS:  Forty-three dogs were homozygous for the ACE polymorphism; five were heterozygous  and 25 were homozygous wild type. The mean age and the median severity of disease  were not different for dogs with the polymorphism and dogs with the wild-type  sequence. The median baseline ACE activity was significantly lower for the ACE  polymorphism (27.0 U/l) than the wild-type sequence dogs (31.0 U/l) (P=0.02).  Dogs with more severe disease and the ACE polymorphism had significantly lower  levels of ACE activity than dogs with the wild-type sequence (P=0.03).  CONCLUSION: The CKCS appears to have a high prevalence of the ACE variant. Dogs  with the ACE variant had lower levels of ACE activity even in more advanced  mitral valve disease than dogs without the variant. The clinical significance of  this finding and its impact on the need for ACE-I in dogs with the polymorphism  and heart disease deserves further study.","2018-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","37-40","","2","28","","Pharmacogenet Genomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29200408","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genotype; *Polymorphism, Genetic; Heart Valve Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology/veterinary; Mitral Valve/physiopathology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Appropriate cases were located through medical searches of medical  records of two large private referral centers. Inclusion criteria comprised of  English springer spaniel dogs with tachypnea and hyperthermia that subsequently  developed weakness or collapse, with or without signs of hemorrhage, soon after a  period of mild-to-moderate exercise. The pedigrees of the four affected dogs, as  well as eleven related English springer spaniels, were then analyzed to determine  a presumptive mode of genetic inheritance. RESULTS: Four dogs met the inclusion  criteria. All four were male, suggesting the possibility of a recessive  sex-linked heritable disorder. Pedigree analysis suggests that more dogs may be  potentially affected, although these dogs may have never had the concurrent  triggering drug/activity/event to precipitate the clinical syndrome. There was  complete resolution of clinical signs in three of the four dogs with aggressive  symptomatic and supportive therapy, with one dog dying during treatment.  CONCLUSION: Dogs with canine stress syndrome have the potential for rapid  recovery if treated aggressively and the complications of the disease (eg,  coagulopathy) are anticipated. All four dogs were male, suggesting the  possibility of a recessive sex-linked mode of inheritance. Further genetic  analyses should be strongly considered by those involved with the English  springer spaniel breed, either with a genome-wide association study using canine  single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays or whole-genome sequencing of affected and  closely related dogs.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","59-68","","","8","","Vet Med (Auckl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 30050857  PMCID: PMC6042503","","","","dog; canine stress syndrome; coagulopathy; English springer spaniel; malignant hyperthermia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary defenses that directly protect the lens against oxidative damage include  small molecule antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, glutathione and carotenoids)  and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the glutathione  enzyme systems - glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). In humans, low plasmatic levels of vitamin C,  vitamin E and carotenoids have been associated with a high risk of senile  cataracts. Dogs are more prone to develop cataracts. A decrease in antioxidant  defenses could be responsible for increased lens oxidation and cataract  development. In this study we report the levels of erythrocytic enzymatic  antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and plasma vitamin C as well as  malondialdehyde, in normal and cataractous English Cocker Spaniel dogs. Plasma  vitamin C levels were consistently lower in cataractous dogs (20.17 &mgr;M +/-  8.2 &mgr;M) when compared with normal dogs (24.1 &mgr;M +/- 9.4 &mgr;M). These  results indicate a possibly decreased synthesis in vitamin C, leading to lower  aqueous humor levels of this vitamin. Considering that vitamin C levels in the  aqueous humor may be responsible for lens antioxidant maintenance, and that these  levels are obtained from plasma secretion through the ciliary epithelium,  decreased plasma levels may indicate a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of  the aqueous humor.","1999","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","83-86","","2","2","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11397247","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although abnormalities in caudal fossa morphology  are considered major contributors to the development of this disease, limited  information exists on the range of morphologies in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  and on the relationship of these to clinically evident disease. Sixty-four  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were studied. Each underwent a neurologic  examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and brain.  T2-weighted sagittal images were used to determine both the morphologic  characteristics and volume of the caudal fossa in each dog. This volume was also  analyzed as a percentage of total cranial cavity volume. Each attribute was  correlated with neurological grade and presence of syringohydromyelia. Fifteen  dogs had neurologic signs, and 59 had morphologic abnormalities of the  craniocervical junction. While 27 dogs had syringohydromyelia, 13 of these were  clinically normal. Cerebellar herniation and occipital dysplasia were common  findings but were not associated with syringohydromyelia. Dorsal compressive  lesions were noted at the first and second cervical vertebral junction. Factors  associated with the presence of neurologic signs included syringohydromyelia and  the ratio of caudal fossa/total cranial cavity volume; dogs with signs had  significantly larger syringohydromyelia than asymptomatic dogs. Caudal fossa size  was not associated with syringohydromyelia. A positive association was identified  between foramen magnum size and length of cerebellar herniation. The prevalence  of craniocervical junction abnormalities is high in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels. While several factors are associated with neurologic signs, occipital  hypoplasia appears to be the most important factor.","2009-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","37-46","","1","50","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19241752","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Atlanto-Axial Joint/pathology; Atlanto-Occipital Joint/pathology; Foramen Magnum/*abnormalities/anatomy & histology; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods/*veterinary; Syndrome; Syringomyelia/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS 89 Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels (CKCSs) and 39 control dogs (not CKCSs). PROCEDURES Platelet count, MPC  concentration, PCDW, and Hct were measured by use of a hematology analyzer, and  CT was measured by use of a platelet function analyzer. Murmur grade and  echocardiographic variables (mitral valve regurgitant jet size relative to left  atrial area, left atrial-to-aortic diameter ratio, and left ventricular internal  dimensions) were recorded. Associations between explanatory variables (sex, age,  murmur grade, echocardiographic variables, platelet count, and Hct) and outcomes  (CT, MPC concentration, and PCDW) were examined by use of multivariate regression  models. RESULTS A model with 5 variables best explained variation in CT (R(2),  0.74), with > 60% of the variance of CT explained by mitral valve regurgitant jet  size. The model of best fit to explain variation in MPC concentration included  only platelet count (R(2), 0.24).

However, platelet  activation, as assessed on the basis of the MPC concentration and PCDW, was not a  feature of subclinical chronic valvular heart disease in CKCSs.","2016-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","860-868","","8","77","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27463549","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; Pedigree; Case-Control Studies; Dog Diseases/*physiopathology; Heart Valve Diseases/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*veterinary; Blood Platelets/*physiology; Platelet Function Tests/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of the occipital bone volume of 43 dogs based on computed tomography  datasets was performed. Volume was determined by means of three-dimensional  models. Using manual segmentation of the occipital bone in sagittal, transverse,  and dorsal images, the volume of the occipital bone and the rest of the skull was  calculated. The absolute occipital bone volume was put in relation to the total  skull volume, the occipital bone index. For the Cavalier King Charles spaniels  without syringomyelia, the median occipital bone index was 0.0681; for Cavalier  King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia, it was 0.0646 and for French bulldogs,  it was 0.0676. There was no global difference of the occipital bone index between  examined groups (P = 0.4331). A reduced volume of the occipital bone was not  found in Cavalier King Charles spaniels in general in comparison to French  bulldogs, or in Cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia compared to  Cavalier King Charles spaniels without syringomyelia. These results do not  support occipital hypoplasia as a cause for syringomyelia development,  challenging the paraxial mesoderm insufficiency theory. This also suggests that  the term Chiari-like malformation, a term derived from human studies, is not  appropriate in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.","2012-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","540-544","","5","53","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22702890","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/veterinary; Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; Imaging, Three-Dimensional/veterinary; Occipital Bone/*diagnostic imaging; Organ Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental on 3D  printed models. METHODS: The plating system was based on morphometric data  obtained from CT. Plates were applied to models and impression material was  measured under the plates at points of interest to define plate bone gap (PBG).  Data on locking screw interference on plate application were also obtained.  RESULTS: Eleven elbows models were plated. Statistical analysis to assess for any  difference in PBG measurements between left and right humuri revealed two loci (3  and 17) under the lateral plate and two loci (3 and 17) under the medial plate.  On cumulate portion analysis, 67% of lateral plate loci and 80% of medial plate  loci had a PBG of ≤2 mm respectively. An incidence of 2.1% (3/143) screw  interference occurred. CONCLUSION: Design of a contoured plating system for  application to humeral models from spaniels with HIF and its application with  objective measurement of PBG is described. The majority of the loci measured  under both lateral and medial plates had a BPG of ≤2 mm and the incidence of  locking screw interference on plate application was low. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:  This novel system may have application for the stabilization of humeral condylar  fractures in spaniels avoiding the need for plate contouring and minimizing the  incidence of locking screw interference.","2023-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","446-459","","3","52","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36056889","","","","Animals; Dogs; *Dog Diseases; *Humeral Fractures/surgery/veterinary; Bone Plates/veterinary; Epiphyses; Fracture Fixation, Internal/veterinary; Humerus/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The calculated parameters of the CKCS were  different from all parameters of mesaticephalic dogs but were the same as  parameters from brachycephalic dogs. However, the CKCS had a wider braincase in  relation to length than in other brachycephalic breeds. Studies of the etiology  of the chiari-like malformation in the CKCS should therefore focus on  brachycephalic control groups.

METHODS: The case records of 10 English cocker spaniels  with dilated cardiomyopathy and pulsus alternans were reviewed. All dogs had been  referred in moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Pulsus alternans was  clinically recognised by palpation of a regular alternation of femoral pulse  amplitude and confirmed by echocardiography in all cases. Pulsus alternans was an  intermittent finding in all 10 dogs. RESULTS: Phonocardiographic recordings were  obtained in three dogs to document variation in the intensity of the heart  sounds, with one case exhibiting absence of the second heart sound in alternate  beats. M-mode echocardiography performed in all dogs showed alternation of the  pattern of mitral valve diastolic motion. Doppler echocardiography showed marked  alternation in stroke volume in the aortic outflow in all cases. It also showed  alternation in mitral regurgitation and in the velocity of early ventricular  filling. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pulsus alternans may be more prevalent in English  cocker spaniels than in other breeds, and because of its intermittent nature, its  incidence may be higher than that previously reported. It has diagnostic  relevance as it usually indicates severe myocardial depression. Echocardiography  allows non-invasive detection of mechanical alternans and provides further  insights into its pathophysiology and clinical significance.","2007-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","258-263","","5","48","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17433080","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis; *Pulse; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/diagnosis/*veterinary; Echocardiography/methods/veterinary; Heart/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electronically stored patient health records from primary-care  practice are emerging as a useful source of epidemiological data in companion  animals. This study used large volumes of health data from UK primary-care  practices participating in the VetCompass animal health surveillance project to  evaluate in detail the disorders diagnosed in a random selection of over 50% of  dogs recorded as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs). Confirmation of breed  using available microchip and Kennel Club (KC) registration data was attempted.  RESULTS: In total, 3624 dogs were recorded as CKCSs within the VetCompass  database of which 143 (3.9%) were confirmed as KC-registered via microchip  identification linkage of VetCompass to the KC database. 1875 dogs (75 KC  registered and 1800 of unknown KC status, 52% of both groups) were randomly  sampled for detailed clinical review. Clinical data associated with veterinary  care were recorded in 1749 (93.3%) of these dogs. The most common specific  disorders recorded during the study period were heart murmur (541 dogs,  representing 30.9% of study group), diarrhoea of unspecified cause (193 dogs,  11.0%), dental disease (166 dogs, 9.5%), otitis externa (161, 9.2%),  conjunctivitis (131, 7.4%) and anal sac infection (129, 7.4%). The five most  common disorder categories were cardiac (affecting 31.7% of dogs), dermatological  (22.2%), ocular (20.6%), gastrointestinal (19.3%) and dental/periodontal  disorders (15.2%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that many  of the disorders commonly affecting CKCSs are largely similar to those affecting  the general dog population presented for primary veterinary care in the UK.  However, cardiac disease (and MVD in particular) continues to be of particular  concern in this breed. FURTHER WORK: This work highlights the value of veterinary  practice based breed-specific epidemiological studies to provide targeted and  evidence-based health policies. Further studies using electronic patient records  in other breeds could highlight their potential disease predispositions.","2015","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","4","","","2","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26401332  PMCID: PMC4579365","","","","Prevalence; Canine; CKCS; Cavalier King Charles spaniel; Electronic patient record; EPR; Primary-care practice; VetCompass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates an unconventional pathogenetic theory for  the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure waves in the subarachnoid  space in CKCS with SM, by analogy with human diseases. In children with  achondroplasia the shortening of the skull base can lead to a narrowing of the  jugular foramina (JF) between the cranial base synchondroses. This in turn has  been reported to cause a congestion of the major venous outflow tracts of the  skull and consequently to an increase in the intracranial pressure (ICP). Amongst  brachycephalic dog breeds the CKCS has been identified as having an extremely  short and wide braincase. A stenosis of the JF and a consequential vascular  compromise in this opening could contribute to venous hypertension, raising ICP  and causing CSF jets in the spinal subarachnoid space of the CKCS. In this study,  JF volumes in CKCSs with and without SM were compared to assess a possible role  of this pathologic mechanism in the development of SM in this breed. RESULTS:  Computed tomography (CT) scans of 40 CKCSs > 4 years of age were used to create  three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and the JF. Weight matched groups  (7-10 kg) of 20 CKCSs with SM and 20 CKCSs without SM were compared. CKCSs  without SM presented significantly larger JF -volumes (median left JF: 0.0633  cm3; median right JF: 0.0703 cm3; p < 0.0001) when compared with CKCSs with SM  (median left JF: 0.0382 cm3; median right JF: 0.0434 cm3; p < 0.0001). There was  no significant difference between the left and right JF within each group.  Bland-Altman analysis revealed excellent reproducibility of all volume  measurements. CONCLUSION: A stenosis of the JF and consecutive venous congestion  may explain the aetiology of CSF pressure waves in the subarachnoid space,  independent of cerebellar herniation, as an additional pathogenetic factor for  the development of SM in this breed.","2012-09-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","158","","","8","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22954070  PMCID: PMC3514347","","","","Animals; Dogs; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/veterinary; Skull/*pathology; Syringomyelia/pathology/*veterinary; Constriction, Pathologic/pathology/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*congenital/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical signs are not  consistently apparent on neurologic examination, and owner reporting of signs  provides vital clinical history. However, owner questionnaires for this disease  are not well developed. OBJECTIVES: To develop a tool to capture owner-reported  clinical signs for use in clinical trials and to compare owner-reported signs  with the presence of pain on neurologic examination and SM on magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI). ANIMALS: Fifty client-owned CKCS. METHODS: Owners completed a  questionnaire and pain/scratch map. Each dog underwent a neurologic examination  and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Questionnaire responses were  developed into scores, area of shading for pain/scratch maps was measured, and  consistency of responses between these tools was assessed. Owner-reported  findings were compared with neurologic examination findings and presence and  severity of SM on MRI. RESULTS: Thirty-three dogs were symptomatic and 17  asymptomatic; 30 had SM. The most common sign of pain was crying out when lifted  (n = 11). Extent of shaded areas on maps positively correlated with questionnaire  scores for pain (r(2)  = 0.213, P = 0.006) and scratch (r(2)  = 0.104,  P = 0.089). Owner-reported findings were not significantly associated with  presence or severity of SM or neurologic examination findings. Owner-reported  lateralization of signs was significantly associated with SM lateralization  (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire and maps may be useful for clinical  trials. Lack of association of owner-reported signs with SM highlights our lack  of understanding of the pathophysiology of pain in this disease.","2018-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","331-339","","1","32","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

It is often concurrent with a complex developmental  malformation of the skull and craniocervical vertebrae called Chiari-like  malformation (CM) characterized by a conformational change and overcrowding of  the brain and cervical spinal cord particularly at the craniocervical junction.  CM and SM have a polygenic mode of inheritance with variable penetrance. RESULTS:  We identified six cranial T1-weighted sagittal MRI measurements that were  associated to maximum transverse diameter of the syrinx cavity. Increased syrinx  transverse diameter has been correlated previously with increased likelihood of  behavioral signs of pain. We next conducted a whole genome association study of  these traits in 65 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs (33 controls, 32  with extreme phenotypes). Two loci on CFA22 and CFA26 were found to be  significantly associated to two traits associated with a reduced volume and  altered orientation of the caudal cranial fossa. Their reconstructed haplotypes  defined two associated regions that harbor only two genes: PCDH17 on CFA22 and  ZWINT on CFA26. PCDH17 codes for a cell adhesion molecule expressed specifically  in the brain and spinal cord. ZWINT plays a role in chromosome segregation and  its expression is increased with the onset of neuropathic pain. Targeted genomic  sequencing of these regions identified respectively 37 and 339 SNPs with  significantly associated P values. Genotyping of tagSNPs selected from these 2  candidate loci in an extended cohort of 461 CKCS (187 unaffected, 274 SM  affected) identified 2 SNPs on CFA22 that were significantly associated to SM  strengthening the candidacy of this locus in SM development. CONCLUSIONS: We  identified 2 loci on CFA22 and CFA26 that contained only 2 genes, PCDH17 and  ZWINT, significantly associated to two traits associated with syrinx transverse  diameter. The locus on CFA22 was significantly associated to SM secondary to CM  in the CKCS dog breed strengthening its candidacy for this disease. This study  will provide an entry point for identification of the genetic factors  predisposing to this condition and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms.","2018-03-22","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","16","","1","19","","BMC Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29566674  PMCID: PMC5865342","","","","Animals; Dogs; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/genetics/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Genome-Wide Association Study/veterinary; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Syringomyelia; *Genetic Loci; Chiari malformation; CKCS dog breed; Cranial Fossa, Posterior/pathology; Cranial MRI measurements; Haplotypes; Pain/genetics/veterinary; Syringomyelia/genetics/*veterinary; Whole genome association study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CM, considered ubiquitous in the cavalier  King Charles spaniel (CKCS) population, results in abnormal cerebrospinal fluid  dynamics which can lead to the development of SM. The clinical signs associated  with CM/SM are frequently confused with other otologic and dermatologic  conditions, which may delay appropriate treatment. A definitive diagnosis of  CM/SM requires advanced imaging; however, due to expense associated with this,  many cases are managed presumptively and symptomatically for the condition. The  primary goal of treatment is to manage neuropathic pain and neurologic deficits  through pharmaceutical or surgical approaches. Current literature suggests that  most CM/SM-affected dogs have progression of their clinical signs in spite of  medical or surgical management; however, most maintain a good quality of life  based on owner assessments. Lack of correlation between structural markers of  disease and clinician and owner-derived measures of neuropathic pain highlight  the need for more robust, quantitative measures of pain in this common veterinary  disease.","2018-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1-11","","1","33","","Top Companion Anim Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate influence of breed,  age, sex, body weight, degree of recording artifact, and mitral valve prolapse  (MVP) on Holter recordings of 3 breeds of small dogs that have differing  predispositions for myxomatous mitral valve disease. The study also assessed if  heart rate (HR) at clinical examination (HRex) was associated with HR during  Holter monitoring and evaluated the reproducibility of Holter variables. ANIMALS:  Fifty clinically healthy, privately owned dogs of the breeds Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel (CKCS), Wire-haired Dachshund (wD), or Cairn Terrier (CT).  METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal observational study. Dogs were recruited for  clinical examination, echocardiography, and Holter monitoring. In 8 CKCS, Holter  recordings were performed twice with a 7-day interval. Arrhythmia and heart rate  variability (HRV) analysis (time and frequency domain analysis) were performed on  Holter recordings. RESULTS: Fifteen out of 27 Holter derived variables were  significantly associated with breed (P < .03), but not with age (P > .7), sex (P  > .2), body weight (P > .7), degree of recording artifact (P > .4), or MVP (P >  .6). During Holter recording, minimum (P = .0001) and mean HR (P = .0001) were  higher in CKCS compared with wD. CKCS had significantly lower values than wD, CT,  or both in 10 out of 13 HRV variables (P < .03). Minimum and mean HR during  Holter recording were correlated with HRex (r = 0.55, P = .0003). HR and time  domain variables had a coefficient of variation <10%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL  IMPORTANCE: There is an influence of breed on Holter-derived variables in 3  breeds of small dogs. Arrhythmia and HRV analysis can be performed on 24-hour  ambulatory ECG (Holter) recordings. Arrhythmia analysis includes HR measurements  and identification of arrhythmias.","2011-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","460-468","","3","25","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21418322","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Body Size/*physiology; Dogs/*physiology; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Masked observers determined syrinx dimensions  and precise location within the spinal cord on magnetic resonance images of 55  cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia. After removal of masking,  syrinx size and location were compared between the cohorts of dogs that exhibited  pain with those that did not. RESULTS: Maximum syrinx width was the strongest  predictor of pain, scratching behaviour and scoliosis in dogs with syringomyelia.  Both pain and syrinx size were positively correlated with syrinxes located in the  dorsal half of the spinal cord. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Large syrinxes associated  with damage to the dorsal part of the spinal cord are associated with persistent  pain suggesting that the pain behaviour expressed by this group of patients is  likely to be ""neuropathic pain,"" resulting from disordered neural processing in  the damaged dorsal horn.

Although abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow secondary to Chiari  malformations is thought to cause syringomyelia in humans, this relationship is  unknown in dogs. We used phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to  evaluate CSF flow in dogs. Fifty-nine Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were  assigned a neurologic grade reflecting their neurologic status. Five normal  control dogs of other breeding were imaged for comparison. The presence of  syringomyelia was noted from sagittal MR images. The pattern and velocity of CSF  flow were assessed using phase-contrast cine MRI at the foramen magnum, C2-C3  disc space, and within syrinxes. Flow was measured most easily with the neck  flexed to mimic standing. CSF flow velocity in the dorsal aspect of the  subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum was significantly higher in control dogs  than Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (P = 0.035). Flow was obstructed at the  foramen magnum in 41 of 59 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Turbulent flow and  jets were associated with syringomyelia presence and severity, and CSF flow  velocity at C2/3 dorsally was inversely related to the presence of syringomyelia  (P = 0.0197). Peak dorsal subarachnoid space CSF flow velocity at the foramen  magnum and C2-C3 were together highly predictive of syringomyelia. CSF flow can  be assessed in dogs using phase-contrast cine MRI. Obstruction to flow at the  foramen magnum is common in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and CSF flow pattern  and velocity are related to the presence of syringomyelia.","2009-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","467-476","","5","50","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19788029","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Syringomyelia/physiopathology/*veterinary; Dogs/*physiology; Cerebrospinal Fluid/*physiology; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology; Foramen Magnum/physiopathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prevalence survey. ANIMALS: 1,053 adult English Springer Spaniels.  PROCEDURE: A mail survey was sent to 2,400 randomly selected owners of adult  American Kennel Club-registered English Springer Spaniels. Dogs with a history of  aggression to family members and familiar humans were compared with dogs without  such a history. RESULTS: 1,053 questionnaires (56.1% of the 1,877 delivered) were  completed. A history of owner-directed growling or more intense aggression was  reported in 510 (48.4%) dogs. Two hundred seventy-seven (26.3%) dogs had bitten a  human in the past; 65.2% of bites were directed at familiar (owner or nonowner)  adults and children. Variables associated with owner-directed aggression included  sex of dog (male), neuter status (neutered, regardless of sex), show or bench  lines, age > 4 years, aggression to unfamiliar adults and children, acquisition  from a hobby breeder, less responsiveness to obedience cues, and a specific  kennel and 1 popular sire from that kennel in a 4-generation pedigree.  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Owner-directed aggression in adult English  Springer Spaniels was associated with a number of environmental, sex-related, and  inherited factors. To reduce the risk of aggression, prospective owners might  seek a female, hunting-type English Springer Spaniel from an experienced breeder.  However, because risk factors are broad and varied, there are limitations to the  extent to which behavior can be predicted and further study is needed of the  inheritance of aggression in this breed.","2005-11-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1594-1603","","10","227","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16313036","","","","Animals; Humans; *Pedigree; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Data Collection; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Age Factors; *Aggression; Behavior, Animal/*physiology; Dogs/genetics/*physiology/*psychology; Personality; Sterilization, Reproductive/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pneumocystis pneumonia was confirmed in all dogs by  visualization of the organism in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or a transthoracic  lung aspirate. Two dogs had a history of demodicosis. Immunoglobulin  concentrations also were measured in breed-and age-matched dogs sampled over the  same period. IgG concentrations were significantly (P = .000) lower in the  affected dogs (median 3.2 mg/mL) than in the control dogs (median 8.5 mg/mL). IgM  concentrations were significantly (P = .002) higher in the affected dogs (median  1.95 mg/mL) than in the control dogs (median 1.12 mg/mL). One affected dog had no  change in IgG concentration more than 3 months after resolution of infection or  vaccination, but did have reduction in IgM concentration after resolution of  infection and vaccination. Control dogs had low serum IgG and IgM concentrations,  compared with the reference interval for all dogs. Lymphocyte count in blood was  normal or high in 7 of 8 affected dogs. The results of this study suggest that  there is a defect in immunity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels that underlies  the susceptibility of these dogs to pneumocystosis. Further studies are indicated  to elucidate the mechanisms behind the defect, the prevalence within the breed,  and the potential mode of inheritance of the problem.","2006-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","523-527","","3","20","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16734084","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Pedigree; Case-Control Studies; Dog Diseases/blood/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology; England/epidemiology; Immunoglobulins/*deficiency; Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/immunology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that STMN1 affects fear behavior, we hypothesized that genetic  variations in the STMN1 transcriptional regulatory region affect gene  transcription activity and control fear behavior. In this study, two single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), g. -327 A>G and g. -125 C>T, were identified in  317 English Springer Spaniels. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that both were  loci located in the canine STMN1 putative promoter region and affected  transcription factor binding. A statistical analysis revealed that the TT  genotype at g.-125 C>T produced a significantly greater fear level than that of  the CC genotype (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the H4H4 (GTGT) haplotype combination  was significantly associated with canine fear behavior (P < 0.01). Using serially  truncated constructs of the STMN1 promoters and the luciferase reporter, we found  that a 395 bp (-312 nt to +83 nt) fragment constituted the core promoter region.  The luciferase assay also revealed that the H4 (GT) haplotype promoter had higher  activity than that of other haplotypes. Overall, our results suggest that the two  SNPs in the canine STMN1 promoter region could affect canine fear behavior by  altering STMN1 transcriptional activity.","2016","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0158756","","7","11","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27390866  PMCID: PMC4938412","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Genotype; *Fear; Genetic Variation/genetics; Haplotypes/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics; Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics; Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional/*genetics; Stathmin/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) skulls were examined and radiographed  during the course of a separate study and all demonstrated changes consistent  with bilateral temporomandibular joint dysplasia. Subsequently, skull radiographs  from all CKCS dogs examined at the University of Glasgow Veterinary School  between 1991 and 2001 were reviewed (n = 26). Only two of these dogs were  radiographed specifically for investigation of the temporomandibular joint,  although varying degrees of dysplasia were identified in all dogs where the  joints were adequately visualized (n = 20). The head of four CKCS cadavers was  also radiographed, and similar changes were found. This finding suggests that  temporomandibular joint dysplasia is a widespread asymptomatic condition in the  CKCS and should be regarded as a normal morphologic variation rather than a  pathologic anomaly. Subtle changes are best seen on lateral oblique radiographs,  although marked changes are also visible on dorsoventral views. The rotational  angle or angle of articulation of each of the dysplastic mandibular condyles was  measured and was related to the severity of the dysplastic changes. However,  there was overlap between the values calculated for these abnormal joints and  normal ones in other breeds, suggesting this measurement was of limited  significance and the shape of the components of the temporomandibular joint are  more relevant when assessing this joint for the presence of dysplastic changes.","2002-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","260-266","","3","43","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12088321","","","","Animals; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging; Records/veterinary; Dogs/*anatomy & histology; Radiography/veterinary; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; Temporomandibular Joint/*anatomy & histology/*diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IDEXX VetAutoread hematology analyzer,  which performs quantitative buffy coat (QBC) analysis, has been validated to  determine platelet mass in CKCS dogs. The Advia 2120 reports a PCT, but the  validity of this value has not been evaluated for dogs with  macrothrombocytopenia. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to validate MPV and  PCT determined by the Advia 2120 in dogs, including CKCS dogs, comparing values  with those obtained from QBC analysis. METHODS: Advia PCT was compared with QBC  results from 43 CKCS dogs and 15 dogs of other breeds in one study. Advia PCT,  platelet count, and MPV were evaluated to identify biologic patterns in 31  clinically healthy CKCS dogs and 66 dogs of 3 other breeds and to generate values  used for comparisons. RESULTS: Advia PCT agreed well with QBC results in general,  but had a negative bias and appeared to underestimate PCT in CKCS dogs with the  lowest PCTs. Advia PCT and MPV results followed expected biologic patterns in  CKCS dogs and dogs of other breeds with MPVs being highest in dogs with the  lowest platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: Advia 2120 PCT and MPV satisfactorily  identified changes in platelet mass and size in CKCS dogs, but PCTs were lower  than expected, especially in CKCS dogs with the lowest PCTs, when compared with  QBC results.","2012-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","336-343","","3","41","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22954296","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*blood; Platelet Count/instrumentation/*veterinary; Predictive Value of Tests; Thrombocytopenia/blood/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When thrombocytopenia and  variation in platelet size occur concurrently, platelet count may poorly estimate  total platelet mass, confounding clinical decision making. OBJECTIVE: We  hypothesized that plateletcrit (PCT) provides clinically important information  when platelet number is an incomplete representation of platelet mass, such as in  genetic macrothrombocytopenia. METHODS: We retrospectively compared platelet  count and PCTs with general reference intervals for 4 groups of dogs: sick  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) and Greyhounds, presented for  nonhematopoietic disease to the University of Minnesota (measured using an Advia  2120) and Auburn University Teaching Hospitals (measured using an Advia 120) over  a 3-year period. RESULTS: A canine PCT reference interval of 0.129-0.403% was  established. None of the 4 sample groups had significantly more individuals below  the reference interval for plateletcrit. For platelet count, only the 2 CKCS  groups had significantly more individuals below the reference interval than  predicted. CONCLUSION: Use of the PCT as determined by the Advia 120/2120  appeared to avoid overestimation of low platelet mass in sick CKCS in a clinical  setting. In contrast, the PCT performed similarly to the platelet count in  evaluation of platelet mass in sick Greyhounds. Evaluation of the PCT should be  considered in other conditions associated with increased mean platelet volume.","2014-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","43-49","","1","43","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology and European Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24446765","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Reference Values; Congenital macrothrombocytopenia; Dog Diseases/*blood/congenital; Mean Platelet Volume/instrumentation/veterinary; Minnesota; Platelet Count/instrumentation/veterinary; platelet mass; primary hemostasis; Thrombocytopenia/blood/congenital/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The natural progression of this disease with time has not been described. The  objectives of this study were to i) determine if syringomyelia progresses with  time ii) determine if features of craniocrebral morphology previously associated  with CM are progressive (including caudal cranial fossa volume, caudal cranial  fossa parenchymal volume, ventricular dimensions, height of the foramen magnum  and degree of cerebellar herniation). A retrospective morphometric analysis was  undertaken in 12 CKCS with CM for which repeat magnetic resonance images were  available without surgical intervention. RESULTS: The maximal syrinx width,  height of the foramen magnum, length of cerebellar herniation and caudal cranial  fossa volume increased over time. Ventricular and caudal fossa parenchymal  volumes were not significantly different between scans. CONCLUSIONS: The results  of this study suggest that syringomyelia progresses with time. Increased caudal  cranial fossa volume may be associated with active resorption of the  supraoccipital bone, which has previously been found in histology specimens from  adult CKCS. We hypothesise that active resorption of the supraoccipital bone  occurs due to pressure from the cerebellum.

Familiarity with  the natural history of these abnormalities is vital to understanding the disease  syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of  worsening clinical signs, syringomyelia, and morphology in CKCS longitudinally.  ANIMALS: Fifty-four client-owned CKCS, 5-13 years old; 50% currently symptomatic.  METHODS: Longitudinal observational study. We enrolled CKCS with an MRI of the  CCJ performed ≥3 years earlier. We used questionnaires and neurologic  examinations to grade initial and current clinical status. Dogs that could be  anesthetized were reimaged. Morphologic assessments included the presence and  severity of: Chiari-like malformations, medullary position, atlantooccipital  overlapping (AOO), dorsal atlantoaxial bands, and syringomyelia. Cranial cavity  volumes and foramen magnum height were measured. RESULTS: Clinical status was  evaluated in 54 dogs; 36/54 were reimaged. Mean follow-up was 71 months. Of  initially asymptomatic dogs, 32% were symptomatic at re-evaluation. Of initially  symptomatic dogs, 56% had worsened; 13% had improved with medical management. The  morphology of the CCJ at initial imaging did not predict development of either  new or worsened signs or syringomyelia by the time of re-evaluation. CONCLUSION:  Craniocervical junction anomalies assessed in this study did not appear  predictive of future clinical status or syringomyelia in our cohort. The impacts  of syringomyelia, AOO, and atlantoaxial bands on future clinical status merit  further study in larger groups of CKCS. Clinical progression in our cohort of  medically managed CKCS did not differ substantially from published reports of  those treated surgically.","2016-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1090-1098","","4","30","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To describe  the position of the medulla at the CCJ in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels  (CKCS), and evaluate its relationship with clinical status and the presence of  syringomyelia. ANIMALS: Thirty-six CKCS, 5-12 years of age, including 16  asymptomatic dogs. METHODS: Dogs were assigned a neurologic grade; magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) of the CCJ then was performed. The presence of a CM and  syringomyelia was recorded and syringomyelia severity was quantified. Medullary  position was quantified using the medullary kinking index, the elevation angle  and obex position relative to the foramen magnum. The relationship between  medullary position measures and presence and severity of neurologic signs and  syringomyelia was investigated. RESULTS: Chiari-like malformation was found in 33  dogs; 26 of them had syringomyelia.

Without intervention, the pups with cleft palate that attempt to  nurse, aspirate and die. In this study, we report on the incidence of cleft  palate in this dog kindred, describe the gross morphologic characteristics of the  cleft, and present a morphometric analysis of the skull of two of the cleft  palate pups and one unaffected pup that died at birth. Our data thus far indicate  26.9% incidence of cleft palate in the colony. Pedigree analysis indicates that  this cleft palate trait is inherited as an autosomal recessive. High resolution  computed tomography scans of the pup heads were used in morphometric comparison  of normal and cleft palate pups. We found specific morphologic differences  between the cranial base and palate of normal and cleft palate pups. Plans for  future studies of the genetics and growth and development of this animal model  are discussed. This canine cleft palate trait provides an ideal model for  studying a malformation common in humans.","1994-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","364-371","","5","31","","Cleft Palate Craniofac J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7986797","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Pedigree; Incidence; Cleft Palate/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs/*abnormalities/genetics; Genes, Lethal; Genes, Recessive; Sex Ratio; Skull/diagnostic imaging; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herniation of the cerebellum into the foramen  magnum is a key diagnostic feature for CM. Midsagittal MR images are the  preferred technique for visualizing cerebellar herniation (CH). OBJECTIVE: To  investigate whether CT can be used to diagnose CH. ANIMALS: Fifteen client-owned  CKCS dogs referred for investigation of the brain and cranial cervical spine on  MRI and CT. METHODS: Two reviewers retrospectively analyzed midsagittal T1WSE and  T2WSE MR images and midsagittal pre- and postcontrast 2D multiplanar reformatted  CT images from each dog for the presence of CH. And, if present, the length (mm,  CHL) of the herniation was measured. The results were analyzed statistically.  RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the different observers and  techniques for the detection of CH and measurement of CHL. Overall, the CHL was  longer on the CT images. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Both techniques are  useful for detecting CH and measuring CHL. Because CHL does not have a known  direct impact on the clinical presentation of CM, CT can be used as a diagnostic  tool in a routine clinical practice for CM in CKCS when MRI is not available. We  emphasize that MRI is the standard screening technique in CKCS for breeding  purposes to detect the presence of CM and SM and, at the current time, CT cannot  replace MRI.","2015-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","238-242","","1","29","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25408117  PMCID: PMC4858103","","","","Animals; Dogs; Chiari-like malformation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*veterinary; Axial imaging modalities; Caudal fossa; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging; Encephalocele/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine if a  mutation in beta1-tubulin correlated with presumptive inherited  macrothrombocytopenia. HYPOTHESIS: A mutation in beta1-tubulin results in  synthesis of an altered beta1-tubulin monomer. alpha-beta tubulin dimers within  microtubule protofilaments are unstable, resulting in altered megakaryocyte  proplatelet formation. ANIMALS: Blood samples were obtained from CKCS and  non-CKCS dogs. METHODS: DNA was used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to  evaluate beta1-tubulin. Platelet numbers and mean platelet volume (MPV) were  evaluated for a correlation with the presence or absence of a mutation identified  in beta1-tubulin. Platelets obtained from homozygous, heterozygous, and clear  CKCS were further evaluated using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence.  RESULTS: A mutation in the gene encoding beta1-tubulin correlated with  macrothrombocytopenia in CKCS. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies  suggest that platelet microtubules are present but most likely are unstable and  decreased in number. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The  macrothrombocytopenia of CKCS correlated with a mutation in beta1-tubulin.  alpha-beta tubulin dimers within protofilaments most likely are unstable, leading  to altered proplatelet formation by megakaryocytes. This information will aid in  distinguishing inherited from acquired thrombocytopenia. It also provides insight  into the mechanism of platelet production by megakaryocytes, and also may prove  useful in understanding heart-related changes in macrothrombocytopenic CKCS with  concurrent mitral valve regurgitation.","2008-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","540-545","","3","22","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18466252","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Genotype; Mutation; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Amino Acid Substitution; Blood Platelets/cytology/ultrastructure; Point Mutation; Thrombocytopenia/genetics/*veterinary; Tubulin/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dogs with syringes express clinical signs or might be clinically silent.  OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and heritability of symptomatic SM, the  association between clinical signs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings,  and long-term outcome. ANIMALS: All CKCS registered in the Danish Kennel Club in  2001 (n = 240). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based prevalence study  validated by telephone interviews and clinically investigated clinical signs of  SM. Dogs were 6 years at the time of investigation. A prospective observational  litter study including clinical investigations, MRI and 5-year follow-up of  symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings. Heritability was estimated based on the  scale of liability in the study population and litter cohort. RESULTS: The  cross-sectional study estimated a prevalence of symptomatic SM at 15.4% in the  population. Thirteen symptomatic and 9 asymptomatic siblings participated in the  litter study. Spinal cord syringes were confirmed in 21 of 22 littermates (95%).  Syrinx diameter and mean syrinx : spinal cord ratio were significantly correlated  with clinical signs (P < .01). Estimated heritability of symptomatic SM was 0.81.  Symptomatic SM motivated euthanasia in 20%. Dogs with syringes, which expressed  no clinical signs at the age of 6, remained asymptomatic in 14/15 cases (93%).

It is characterized by chronic progressive degenerative lesions of the mitral  valve. The valve leaflets become thickened and prolapse into the left atrium  resulting in mitral regurgitation (MR). MMVD is most prevalent in small to medium  sized dog breeds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) in particular. The onset  of MMVD is highly age dependent, and at the age of 10 years, nearly all CKCS are  affected. The incidence of a similar disease in humans-mitral valve prolapse-is  1-5%. By defining CKCSs with an early onset of MMVD as cases and old dogs with no  or mild signs of MMVD as controls, we conducted a genome-wide association study  (GWAS) to identify loci associated with development of MMVD. We have identified a  1.58 Mb region on CFA13 (P(genome) = 4.0 × 10(-5)) and a 1.68 Mb region on CFA14  (P(genome) = 7.9 × 10(-4)) associated with development of MMVD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of dogs aged 1 to 18 months presenting  with a problem list including pyrexia (≥⃒39∙2°C) that was reproducible during  referral hospitalisation were retrospectively reviewed. Signalment, history -  including previous treatment, clinical examination findings and diagnosis were  recorded. Diagnoses were categorised as non-infectious inflammatory, infectious,  congenital, neoplastic and miscellaneous. The influence of previous treatment on  the ability to reach a final diagnosis was analysed. RESULTS: A total of 140  cases was identified. Diagnosis was reached in 115 cases. Non-infectious  inflammatory disease was identified in 91 cases (79%), infectious disease in 19  cases (17%), a congenital disorder in four dogs (3%) and neoplasia in one dog  (1%). Breeds most commonly identified were Border collies (17/140; 12%), beagles  (16/140; 11%), Labrador retrievers (11/140; 8%), springer spaniels (9/140; 6%)  and cocker spaniels (8/140; 6%).

Within 4 months of the dam's death, 3  offspring also died suddenly. HYPOTHESIS: Abnormal cardiac repolarization, caused  by an inherited long QT syndrome, is thought to be responsible for arrhythmias  leading to sudden death in this family. ANIMALS: Four remaining dogs from the  affected litter and 11 related dogs. METHODS: Physical examination and resting  ECG were done on the littermates and 9 related dogs. Additional tests on some or  all littermates included echocardiogram with Doppler, Holter monitoring, and  routine serum biochemistry. Blood for DNA sequencing was obtained from all 15  dogs. RESULTS: Three of 4 littermates examined, but no other dogs, had prolonged  QT intervals with unique T-wave morphology. DNA sequencing of the KCNQ1 gene  identified a heterozygous single base pair mutation, unique to these 3 dogs,  which changes a conserved amino acid from threonine to lysine and is predicted to  change protein structure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This family  represents the first documentation in dogs of spontaneous familial QT  prolongation, which was associated with a KCNQ1 gene mutation and sudden death.  Although the final rhythm could not be documented in these dogs, their phenotypic  manifestations of QT interval prolongation and abnormal ECG restitution suggested  increased risk for sudden arrhythmic death. The KCNQ1 gene mutation identified is  speculated to impair the cardiac repolarizing current IKs, similar to KCNQ1  mutations causing long QT syndrome 1 in humans.","2015-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","561-568","","2","29","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: Investigate the influence of AA bands on  clinical status and syringomyelia (SM) in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels  (CKCS). ANIMALS: Thirty-six CKCS, 5-12 years of age, including 20 dogs with  neuropathic pain. METHODS: Dogs were examined and assigned a neurologic grade.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the craniocervical junction was performed  with the craniocervical junction extended and flexed (ie, normal standing  position). Imaging studies were assessed for the presence of an AA band, CM, SM  or some combination of these findings. Band and SM severity were quantified using  an objective compression index and ordinal grading scale, respectively. RESULTS:  Of 36 CKCS imaged, 34 had CM. Atlantoaxial bands were associated with the  presence (P = .0031) but not the severity (P = .008) of clinical signs, whereas  their presence was associated with both the presence and severity of SM (P =  .0147, P = .0311, respectively ). Higher compression indices were associated with  more severe SM (P = .0137). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of AA bands in older CKCS is  high. Positioning of dogs in extension during MRI enhances the sensitivity of the  study for detecting this important abnormality. There were significant  associations among AA bands, clinical signs, and SM in dogs with CM; additional  work is needed to understand whether or not this relationship is causal.","2015-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","887-892","","3","29","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To  determine which A-ECG parameters, derived from 12-lead A-ECG recordings, change  with severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by myxomatous mitral valve  disease (MMVD) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) in sinus rhythm.  ANIMALS: Seventy-six privately owned CKCSs. METHODS: Dogs were prospectively  divided into 5 groups according to the degree of MR (estimated by color Doppler  mapping as the percentage of the left atrial area affected by the MR jet) and  presence of clinical signs. High fidelity approximately 5-minute 12-lead ECG  recordings were evaluated using custom software to calculate multiple  conventional and A-ECG parameters. RESULTS: Nineteen of 76 ECG parameters were  significantly different (P < .05) across the 5 dog groups. A 4-parameter model  that incorporated results from 1 parameter of heart rate variability, 2  parameters of QT variability, and 1 parameter of QRS amplitude was identified  that explained 82.4% of the variance with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.60  (P < .01). When age or murmur grade was included in the statistical model the  prediction value further increased the R to 0.74 and 0.85 (P < .01),  respectively. CONCLUSION: In CKCSs with sinus rhythm, 4 selected A-ECG parameters  further improve prediction of MR jet severity beyond age and murmur grade,  although the predictive increment in this study probably is not sufficient to  warrant utilization in clinical veterinary practice.","2012-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","93-100","","1","26","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22168834","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; Ultrasonography; Predictive Value of Tests; Electrocardiography/methods/*veterinary; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*veterinary; Principal Component Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasonography revealed kidneys of significantly (p < 0.001)  reduced volume in all dogs. During qualitative evaluation, two different types of  sonographic alterations could be seen. In one type of the ultrasound alterations,  corticomedullary demarcation was distinct and the renal cortex was remarkably  thin, which was best seen in the dorsal (frontal) imaging plane. In the other  type of the ultrasound appearance, overall increased echogenicity with poor  corticomedullary demarcation was noticed, and the kidneys could hardly be  separated from their surroundings. These features were best recognised in the  sagittal (coronal) imaging plane. In one dog with secondary hypercalcaemia, a  hyperechoic corticomedullary area was also seen. Post-mortem histological  diagnosis revealed renal dysplasia and secondary fibrosis. Based on ultrasound  findings alone, renal dysplasia (renal familial disease) can be suspected when  small kidneys with thin echogenic cortex are present in young dogs. An ultrasound  image, similar to that of fibrotic kidneys (increased overall echogenicity and  reduced corticomedullary definition) cannot be differentiated from chronic  inflammatory disease and from end-stage kidneys. Therefore, ultrasound-guided  biopsy or post-mortem histology is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of  renal dysplasia.

In our study we examine the influence of allometric scaling of  the brain and cranial cavity volume on morphological parameters in different dog  breeds. MRI scans of 110 dogs (35 mesaticephalic dogs, 35 brachycephalic dogs, 20  CKCSs with SM, and 20 CKCSs without SM) have been used to create 3-dimensional  volumetric models of skull and brain parts. Volumes were related to body weight  calculating the adjusted means for different breeds. RESULTS: There was a strong  global dependency of all volumes to body weight (P < 0.0001). The adjusted means  of the absolute and relative volumes of brain parenchyma and cranial compartments  are not significantly larger in CKCSs in comparison to brachycephalic and  mesaticephalic dogs. A difference in absolute or relative volumes between CKCSs  with and without SM after relating these values to body weight could not be  identified. The relative volume of the hindbrain parenchyma (caudal fossa  parenchyma percentage) was larger in brachycephalic dogs than in CKCSs, without  causing herniation or SM. CONCLUSION: An influence of body weight exist in dogs,  which can be sufficiently large to render conclusions on the difference in  volumes of the brain and skull unsafe unless some account of the body weight is  taken in the analysis. The results of this study challenge the role of  overcrowding for the development of SM in dogs.","2014-05-13","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","30","","1","56","","Acta Vet Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24886598  PMCID: PMC4038113","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; *Body Weight; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary; Brain/*abnormalities; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/pathology; Dogs/*abnormalities/genetics/physiology; Skull/*abnormalities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pathophysiology of this pain is not fully  understood. HYPOTHESIS: Neuropathic pain in CKCS is a result of a  neuroinflammatory process. ANIMALS: Twenty-six client-owned dogs: 15 dogs with  clinical signs of cervical hyperesthesia (group 1), and 11 dogs without of  clinical signs (group 2). METHODS: Dogs were examined by magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI). Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and substance P were  measured in CSF and compared with morphological findings on MRI and clinical pain  scores. RESULTS: All dogs without clinical signs had symmetrical syringomyelia,  whereas in the group with pain, 6 dogs had symmetrical and 9 dogs had  asymmetrical syringomyelia. Pain and syringomyelia asymmetry were correlated, and  a strong association between pain and dorsal horn involvement of syringomyelia  was observed. There was no significant difference between the mean width of the  syringomyelia in dogs with or without pain. The concentrations of interleukin-6  and substance P were significantly higher in dogs with neuropathic pain. Tumor  necrosis factor alpha was not detected in either group. Concentrations of  substance P were significantly higher in dogs with asymmetrical syringomyelia or  dorsal horn involvement, whereas interleukin-6 concentrations were not  significantly different between groups.

ANIMALS: Healthy dogs (n = 15) and dogs  with mild MMVD (18), moderate-severe MMVD (19), or severe MMVD with congestive  heart failure (CHF; 10). PROCEDURES: Blood samples were collected from each dog.  Serum and plasma serotonin concentrations were measured with an ELISA, and  surface-bound platelet serotonin expression and platelet activation were  determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Dogs with mild MMVD had higher median  serum (746 ng/mL) and plasma (33.3 ng/mL) serotonin concentrations, compared with  MMVD-affected dogs with CHF (388 ng/mL and 9.9 ng/mL, respectively), but no other  group differences were found.

In affected dogs, the thrombocytes often are large, and it has  been speculated that the condition could be an inherited macrothrombocytopenia.  The aim of this study was to examine the inheritance of idiopathic, asymptomatic  thrombocytopenia in CKCS. Sixteen families (both parents and > or = 3 offspring)  of privately owned CKCS were included. There were 105 clinically healthy dogs (50  from Denmark and 55 from Sweden): 81 offspring and 26 parents (2 dogs had both  roles). Because autoanalyzers have difficulty counting large platelets, the  platelets were counted manually, with a counting chamber. Platelet counts were  not influenced by age, gender, or heart murmur status. Thrombocytopenia (< or =  100,000 platelets/microL) was found in 46% of the parents. The pedigrees  indicated that thrombocytopenia segregated as an autosomal recessive trait and  that 100,000 platelets/microL was appropriate as a lower limit of normal.  Affected offspring were found in all families, showing that all of the included  parents were at least carriers. Therefore, the expected segregation ratios (which  were in good accordance with the observed ones) were 1:0, 1:1, and 1:3 for the 3  crosses: affected x affected, normal x affected, and normal x normal. Within a  given cross, the mean parental platelet count had no influence on the platelet  counts of the offspring. We conclude that idiopathic, asymptomatic  thrombocytopenia in CKCS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The  condition most likely constitutes an inherited macrothrombocytopenia in dogs.","2002-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","169-173","","2","16","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11899033","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Autoanalysis/veterinary; Cell Size; Platelet Count/methods/veterinary; *Genes, Recessive; Chromosome Aberrations; Dog Diseases/blood/*genetics; Thrombocytopenia/blood/genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Clinically normal adult  cavalier King Charles spaniel underwent ultrasonographic examination of the  spinal cord and caudal fossa. Computed tomography was used to measure the caudal  fossa and magnetic resonance imaging allowed syringomyelia and cerebellar  herniation identification. RESULTS: Of the 16 dogs in the study, seven had  syringomyelia (43.7 per cent). All dogs had cerebellar herniation, suggesting  Chiari-like malformation and also a tendency to occipital dysplasia. Computed  tomography measurements of the caudal fossa are reported. In one dog, a syrinx  was identified by ultrasonography. The only difference between dogs with or  without syringomyelia was that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia  were statistically older. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The incidence of Chiari-like  malformation and syringomyelia may be high in an asymptomatic population of  cavalier King Charles spaniel . Computed tomography measurements reported in this  study should now be compared with those of a symptomatic population to evaluate  the hypothesis that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia syndrome  have a smaller caudal fossa. This study did not identify a smaller caudal fossa  in an asymptomatic cavalier King Charles spaniel population with syringomyelia.

To evaluate if volumes are associated with  transverse syrinx width. METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 59 CKCS with CM  were retrospectively reviewed and grouped with or without SM. Three-dimensional  images were created and volumes of the fossae, brain parenchyma and ventricular  system were calculated from which percentages of CCF, CCFP and V were created. If  present, syrinx size was measured from its maximal transverse width. The  percentages were statistically compared between groups, and correlation between  percentages and syrinx dimensions was made. RESULTS: CKCS with SM had  significantly higher CCFP (P=0.0001) and V (P=0.0002) to those without but no  significant difference in CCF (P=0.925). There was a positive correlation between  CCFP and syrinx width (Pearson r=0.437) and ventricle size to syrinx width  (Spearman r=0.627). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A more marked overcrowding of the CCF  is associated with SM, which may explain the high incidence of SM in CKCS with  CM. The association between ventricle and syrinx dimensions supports the theory  that SM development is the result of altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.","2010-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","382-386","","7","51","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20536691","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Syringomyelia/pathology/*veterinary; Cerebrospinal Fluid/physiology; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/pathology/*veterinary; Cranial Fossa, Posterior/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular defect in dogs from Colorado was proven to be  the same as that in British and Australian dogs. None of the other 60  American-bred dogs carried the mutant allele. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  A PCR method that can be used to identify dogs affected with or carriers of the  autosomal recessive disease fucosidosis was established. Amplification was  achieved within a GC-rich region, using a method that may be useful in overcoming  amplification problems in GC-rich areas within other genes. Using this test,  fucosidosis can be controlled and ultimately eradicated from the English Springer  Spaniel population.","1999-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","726-729","","6","60","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10376901","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Australia; Pedigree; *Mutation; United Kingdom; Genetic Carrier Screening; alpha-L-Fucosidase/blood/*genetics; Base Pairing; Colorado; Cytosine; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics; Fucosidosis/diagnosis/genetics/*veterinary; Gene Amplification; Genetic Testing/methods/*veterinary; Guanine; Polymerase Chain Reaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: 7 and 5  client-owned English Springer Spaniels (1 to 11 years old) with and without  retinal dysplasia, respectively. PROCEDURES: Blood samples were obtained from  affected and unaffected dogs via venipuncture. Genomic DNA was extracted from  WBCs of the 7 affected and 5 unaffected dogs, and relative quantification of the  cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (COX1) was determined via analysis of  real-time PCR results. White blood cells from 3 affected and 4 unaffected dogs  were embedded in epoxide resin for TEM; cross sections were examined for  lymphocytes, which were measured. The mitochondria within lymphocytes were  quantified, and the mitochondrial surface area per lymphocyte cross section was  calculated. A masked technique was used to compare mitochondrial morphology  between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared with the smallest measured quantity of  mtDNA among unaffected dogs, mtDNA amounts varied among unaffected (1.08- to  4.76-fold differences) and affected dogs (1- to 2.68-fold differences). Analysis  of lymphocyte measurements and mitochondrial surface area, morphology, and  quantity revealed no significant differences between affected and unaffected  dogs.

To evaluate if cerebellar herniation in CKCS correlates with caudal  fossa volume. METHODS: In this retrospective study, three-dimensional images were  created from magnetic resonance imaging brain series of 117 dogs (split into  three groups: CKCS, Labradors and small breeds) from which the volumes of the  fossae and brain parenchyma were calculated. These volumes were transformed into  percentages of total cranial cavity and parenchyma volumes, respectively. The  percentages were statistically compared among the groups. The percentage of  herniated cerebellum in the CKCS was compared using linear regression with the  caudal fossa and parenchyma percentages. RESULTS: Cavalier King Charles spaniels  had a proportionately smaller caudal fossa compared with Labradors (P=0.002) but  not to small breeds (P=0.103). Their caudal fossa parenchyma was proportionately  the same volume as Labradors (P=0.976) but greater than small breeds (P=0.005).  No relationship was found for the per cent of cerebellum herniated. CLINICAL  SIGNIFICANCE: The results support mesoderm insufficiency or craniosynostosis as  the pathogenesis of Chiari-like malformation (CM) in CKCS. It presents evidence  for overcrowding of the caudal fossa due to a mismatch of brain parenchyma and  fossa volumes as to why CKCS and not other small dogs are affected.","2009-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","399-405","","8","50","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19689667","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Skull/*pathology; Cranial Fossa, Posterior/pathology; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/pathology/*veterinary; Encephalocele/pathology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Syringomyelia is often  linked with obstruction of the craniocervical junction and a Chiari malformation,  which is similar in both humans and animals. Some brachycephalic toy breed dogs  such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are particularly predisposed. The  exact mechanism of the formation of syringomyelia is undetermined and  consequently with the lack of clinical explanation, engineers and mathematicians  have resorted to computer models to identify possible physical mechanisms that  can lead to syringes. We developed a computer model of the spinal cavity of a  CKCS suffering from a large syrinx. The model was excited at the cranial end to  simulate the movement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the spinal cord due to  the shift of blood volume in the cranium related to the cardiac cycle. To  simulate the normal condition, the movement was prescribed to the CSF. To  simulate the pathological condition, the movement of CSF was blocked. RESULTS:  For normal conditions the pressure in the SAS was approximately 400 Pa and the  same applied to all stress components in the spinal cord. The stress was  uniformly distributed along the length of the spinal cord. When the blockage  between the cranial and spinal CSF spaces forced the cord to move with the  cardiac cycle, shear and axial normal stresses in the cord increased  significantly. The sites where the elevated stress was most pronounced coincided  with the axial locations where the syringes typically form, but they were at the  perimeter rather than in the central portion of the cord. This elevated stress  originated from the bending of the cord at the locations where its curvature was  high. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that it is possible that repetitive  stressing of the spinal cord caused by its exaggerated movement could be a cause  for the formation of initial syringes. Further consideration of factors such as  cord tethering and the difference in mechanical properties of white and grey  matter is needed to fully explore this possibility.","2018-03-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","82","","1","14","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29523203  PMCID: PMC5845370","","","","Animals; Dogs; Spinal Cord/pathology; Syrinx; Chiari malformation; *Computer Simulation; Cavalier king Charles spaniels; Dog Diseases/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology/*pathology; Mathematical modelling; Pathophysiology; Syringomyelia/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IDEXX Vet Autoread (QBC) hematology analyzer directly measures the  relative volume of platelets in a blood sample (plateletcrit). We hypothesized  that CKCS both with and without hereditary macrothrombocytosis would have a  normal plateletcrit and that the QBC results would better identify the total  circulating volume of platelets in CKSC than methods directly enumerating  platelet numbers. OBJECTIVES: The major purpose of this study was to compare the  QBC platelet results with platelet counts from other automated and manual methods  for evaluating platelet status in CKCS dogs. METHODS: Platelet counts were  determined in fresh EDTA blood from 27 adult CKCS dogs using the QBC, Sysmex  XT-2000iV (optical and impedance), CELL-DYN 3500, blood smear estimate, and  manual methods. Sysmex optical platelet counts were reanalyzed following gating  to determine the number and percentage of normal- and large-sized platelets in  each blood sample. RESULTS: None of the 27 CKCS dogs had thrombocytopenia  (defined as <164 x 10(9) platelets/L) based on the QBC platelet count. Fourteen  (52%) to 18 (66%) of the dogs had thrombocytopenia with other methods. The  percentage of large platelets, as determined by regating the Sysmex optical  platelet counts, ranged from 1% to 75%, in a gradual continuum. CONCLUSIONS: The  QBC may be the best analyzer for assessing clinically relevant thrombocytopenia  in CKCS dogs, because its platelet count is based on the plateletcrit, a  measurement of platelet mass.","2008-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","266-271","","3","37","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18761517","","","","Animals; Dogs; Predictive Value of Tests; Dog Diseases/blood/*genetics; Blood Platelet Disorders/genetics/*veterinary; Diagnostic Tests, Routine/veterinary; Platelet Count/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The condition affects more than 100 dog breeds and is known  to be genetically heterogeneous between breeds. Around 19 mutations have now been  identified that are associated with PRA in around 49 breeds, but for the majority  of breeds the mutation(s) responsible have yet to be identified. Using  genome-wide association with 22 Tibetan Spaniel PRA cases and 10 controls, we  identified a novel PRA locus, PRA3, on CFA10 (p(raw) = 2.01 × 10(-5), p(genome) =  0.014), where a 3.8 Mb region was homozygous within 12 cases. Using targeted next  generation sequencing, a short interspersed nuclear element insertion was  identified near a splice acceptor site in an intron of a provocative gene,  FAM161A. Analysis of mRNA from an affected dog revealed that the SINE causes exon  skipping, resulting in a frame shift, leading to a downstream premature  termination codon and possibly a truncated protein product. This mutation  segregates with the disease in 22 out of 35 cases tested (63%). Of the PRA  controls, none are homozygous for the mutation, 15% carry the mutation and 85%  are homozygous wildtype. This mutation was also identified in Tibetan Terriers,  although our results indicate that PRA is genetically heterogeneous in both  Tibetan Spaniels and Tibetan Terriers.","2014","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e93990","","4","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24705771  PMCID: PMC3976383","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genotype; Mutation; Chromosome Mapping; Genome-Wide Association Study; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; *Alternative Splicing; *Exons; *Introns; *Mutagenesis, Insertional; *Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements; Eye Proteins/*genetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*genetics; Retinal Degeneration/*genetics; Transcription, Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dog demonstrates two types of endothelial dystrophy, one of  which (posterior polymorphous dystrophy in the American Cocker Spaniel) does not  lead to corneal edema. Endothelial dystrophy observed in the Boston Terrier,  Chihuahua, and other breeds is associated with progressive corneal edema, which  can lead to bullous keratopathy and corneal erosions.

An echocardiographic study.","Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire","","0830-9000","","","Clinical studies have shown that Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) have a high prevalence of mitral valvular insufficiency (MVI). Echocardiography has the  potential to disclose early valvular changes, and the present prospective study  was designed to investigate the occurrence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in  young CKCS without heart murmurs, and to correlate the degree of MVP with the  clinical status of the dogs by including CKCS with MVI as well. The study was  based on blinded evaluations of echocardiographic recordings of mitral valves  from 34 CKCS and 30 control dogs. Thirteen (87%) of 15 three-year-old CKCS  without heart murmurs had MVP (2 total and 11 partial), as compared with 1 (7%)  of 15 three-year-old normal Beagle dogs (P < 0.0001), and none of 15  three-year-old normal Medium Size Poodles (P < 0.0001). Of 19 CKCS with MVI, MVP  was found in 84% of the entire group and in 100% of dogs with pulmonary  congestion or edema. The occurrence of total MVP tended to be higher in the group  with MVI (47%, 9/19), when compared with the younger CKCS without heart murmurs  (13%, 2/15, P = 0.06). MVP was positively associated with excessive heart rate  variability (P = 0.003). The radius of curvature of the anterior mitral valve  leaflet in systole was significantly reduced in dogs with MVP when compared with  those without (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, this study shows that CKCS at an early  age have a high occurrence of MVP. This suggests: 1) A genetic predisposition of  CKCS to MVP; and 2) That MVP is a pathogenetic factor in the development of  mitral valvular insufficiency. Follow up studies may add further support to these  proposals, and clarify whether echocardiography may be an aid in selecting CKCS  for future breeding.","1995-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","294-298","","4","59","","Can J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 8548691  PMCID: PMC1263784","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prevalence; Echocardiography/veterinary; Prospective Studies; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/epidemiology/veterinary; Mitral Valve Prolapse/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three puppies developed FN. Proteinuria, which began when these puppies were  five-to-eight months old, was the first abnormality detected. Proteinuria  persisted while each puppy's growth rate slowed, and renal function gradually  deteriorated. The interval from onset of proteinuria to development of azotemia  was two-to-nine months. Characteristic glomerular capillary basement membrane  (GCBM) lesions were seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of renal  biopsy specimens obtained during this interval. Ultrastructural GCBM lesions  progressed substantially during the interval from biopsy to necropsy. However,  routine light microscopic findings did not allow definitive diagnosis of FN in  either biopsy or necropsy specimens. Detection of FN can be accomplished by  screening at-risk ECSs for proteinuria. Renal biopsies are required to confirm  the diagnosis in dogs for which proteinuria cannot be explained otherwise.  Percutaneous needle biopsy specimens sufficient for TEM must be used to examine  the GCBM to make a definitive diagnosis.","1998-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","189-195","","3","34","","J Am Anim Hosp Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9590445","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Creatinine/urine; Aging/pathology/urine; Basement Membrane/pathology/ultrastructure; Biopsy/veterinary; Body Weight/physiology; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/genetics/physiopathology; Heterozygote; Kidney Diseases/diagnosis/genetics/physiopathology/*veterinary; Kidney Glomerulus/*pathology/ultrastructure; Microscopy, Electron/veterinary; Proteinuria/genetics/urine/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heart rate variability was assessed by the natural  logarithm of the variance of the R-R intervals for 20 consecutive beats obtained  from electrocardiographic recordings. Twenty-two of the dogs were clinically  normal and 59 had mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease. The  severity of mitral regurgitation was evaluated by echocardiography and thoracic  radiography. Heart rate variability was found to be reduced (P < 0.001) among  dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular dilatation and clinical signs of  congestion. No significant differences in heart rate variability were found among  normal dogs, dogs with only cardiac murmur, and dogs with echoradiographic  evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and ventricular dilatation. Overall,  an association was found between heart rate variability and left atrial to aortic  root ration and left ventricular end diastolic diameters (r = 0.72 and 0.64,  respectively, P < 0.001), as well as heart and respiratory rate (r = 0.80 and  0.69, respectively, P < 0.001). Multiregression analysis showed that, in order of  importance, heart rate, left atrial diameter and respiratory rate had significant  effects on heart rate variability. Among these parameters, heart rate variability  and left atrial diameter were found to be most efficient in separating  decompensated dogs from compensated. It is concluded that heart rate variability  may provide the clinician with valuable information when assessing the severity  of mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease.","1996-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","69-75","","2","37","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8656596","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*physiopathology; Severity of Illness Index; Heart Rate/*physiology; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/physiopathology/*veterinary; Respiration/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These data were supplemented with  published information from the breed club. The incidence of syringomyelia was  very high in certain families and lines which had been extensively inbred. The  affected dogs could be traced back to one bitch born in 1956 and the two  offspring from her single litter. Four key dogs representing four major breeding  lines consistently occurred within the individual pedigrees. If a dog had more  than five of its eight great-grandparents descended from these four lines there  was a greater chance of it having syringomyelia. The data from this preliminary  study suggest that occipital bone hypoplasia is hereditary in the cavalier King  Charles spaniel and that its inheritance is more likely to be autosomal recessive  because both dam and sire must be inbred descendants from certain lines. However,  the inheritance is more likely to be of variable penetrance or oligogenic than  simple.","2003-07-26","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","107-112","","4","153","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12918827","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Dog Diseases/*genetics/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Syringomyelia/genetics/*veterinary; *Databases, Factual; Bone Diseases/genetics/*veterinary; Occipital Bone/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deutsche tierarztliche Wochenschrift","","0341-6593","","","In 21 normal dogs of different breeds and ages the number of nephrons was calculated from paraffin sections in comparison with a maceration method. With  these methods the number of glomeruli x 1000 per kidney appeared to be 502 +/-  213 and 515 +/- 230 respectively. The histological method appeared to be  acceptable for the determination of the number of glomeruli in incomplete  kidneys. The examined Cocker Spaniels consisted of 5 animals without renal  problems for control and 21 animals with nephropathy: 12 of 1-2 years, 6 of 4-6  years and 3 of 9-10 years old dogs. As indication for the present number of  nephrons the glomeruli were counted in bands of whole cortex with a width of 1  mm. The number of glomeruli per band of cortex in the nephropathic Cocker  Spaniels (15.0 +/- 3.0) was not drastic lower than those of the normal Cockers  (20.8 +/- 2.5) and of 7 normal adult dogs of different breeds (17.2 +/- 2.2). On  pathological examination the nephropathic kidneys showed a  membranoproliferative-sclerosing glomerulonephritis with extra-capillary reaction  leading to glomerular obsolescence. The animals showed evident proteinuria and  final renal insufficiency. It was concluded that the pathogenesis of the familial  nephropathy in this breed will not be caused by cortical hypoplasia, but by a  primary glomerulopathy.","1989-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","174-179","","4","96","","Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 2653774","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Kidney Diseases/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/genetics/*pathology; Kidney Glomerulus/*pathology; Nephrons/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Historical cohort. ANIMALS: 54 female and 53 male Cavalier  King Charles Spaniel offspring. PROCEDURE: 7 sires, selected on the basis of  their liability to develop CVD, were screened for clinical signs of CVD and  assigned to 1 of 3 groups (late, intermediate, and early onset of CVD). The mates  of these sires (30 dams) were selected and classified likewise, and 107 offspring  produced in 1988 from matings between these parents were screened for clinical  signs of CVD at a mean age of 5.3 +/- 0.3 years. RESULTS: 55% of the offspring  were free from clinical signs of CVD, whereas 45% had cardiac murmurs of low or  moderate intensity. The proportion of offspring with heart murmurs and the  intensity of murmurs were significantly greater with increased parental  classification. More males than females had developed murmurs, and murmurs of  moderate intensity also were more prevalent in males. Results of  multiple-regression analysis indicated that mean parental classification and sex  had significant effects on proportion of offspring with murmurs and their  intensity. Additionally, age affected disease prevalence and severity, despite  the narrow range in age of offspring examined. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Parental  CVD status is an important factor influencing the probability of heart murmurs  and their intensity in offspring. The results of this study indicate that CVD  development is a polygenic threshold trait and that sex of the offspring  influences threshold levels.","1996-06-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2009-2012","","12","208","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8707674","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Dog Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics; Age Factors; Cohort Studies; *Breeding; Heart Murmurs/epidemiology/genetics/veterinary; Heart Valve Diseases/epidemiology/genetics/*veterinary; Chronic Disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The clinical signs may  be confused with those of recurrent immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. The  deficiency has been commonly observed in field trial (working) English springer  spaniels (ESSPs), but also in the conformation line of ESSPs in the USA over the  past two decades. This report documents the first family of ESSPs found with PFK  deficiency in Europe. Two related adult ESSPs in Denmark had intermittent signs  of pigmenturia after exercise (hunting) and had evidence of a regenerative  haemolytic anaemia. Based upon DNA sequencing data, both dogs had the previously  described nonsense point mutation in the muscle-type PFK gene (delta2228G-->A).  Study of 17 related family members using a simple and accurate PFK-DNA test  revealed one additional PFK-deficient dog (with minor exercise intolerance), nine  carriers and seven normal (or 'clear') ESSPs. Recently, the authors have also  identified PFK carriers and affected ESSPs in the UK. Screening for PFK  deficiency is recommended for ESSPs with suspicious clinical signs and before  using any for field trials or breeding in order to prevent the further spread of  this hereditary disorder.","2001-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","298-300","","6","42","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11440399","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Pedigree; Diagnosis, Differential; Point Mutation; Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/etiology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/genetics; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/veterinary; Erythrocytes/enzymology; Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII/complications/diagnosis/*veterinary; Phosphofructokinase-1/blood/*deficiency/genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This technique is used with  great success in human medicine. STUDY DESIGN: Four CKCS diagnosed by Magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) of SHM because of cerebellar tonsil herniation and not  responsive to medical therapy underwent a suboccipital craniectomy and dorsal  laminectomy of C1 (2 dogs) and of C1 and partial C2 (2 dogs) with durotomy and  placement of a dural graft. Three dogs were evaluated neurologically 24 hours, 1  month, and 3 months postoperatively and evaluations were compared with  preoperative neurological examination. Repeat MRI took place 3 months  postoperatively. RESULTS: Neurological examinations showed neither improvement  nor progression of clinical signs 3 months postoperatively. MRI showed no  regression of syrinx size 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Improvement was  not seen. Given the progressive nature of the disorder, evaluation over a longer  period of time is necessary to detect if progression has stopped. Some  modification to the surgical technique is needed to accomplish the same results  as in human medicine. A study of a larger population is needed to attain more  reliable information.

Clinical features of the disease included proteinuria and progressive  deterioration of renal function. Dogs were 11 to 27 months old when euthanized  because of severe chronic renal failure. Grossly, the renal cortices were thin.  Light microscopic evaluation revealed diffuse glomerular disease characterized by  mesangial thickening, glomerular fibrosis, periglomerular fibrosis, and  glomerular obsolescence. Based on these clinical and pathologic features,  familial nephropathy of English Cocker Spaniels was suspected despite the fact  that the individual dogs were not closely related. On transmission electron  microscopy, a distinctive ultrastructural lesion was observed in the glomerular  basement membranes (GBM) of all dogs. The GBM exhibited extensive thickening,  multilaminar splitting, and fragmentation. Electron dense deposits, suggestive of  immunocomplex glomerular disease, were notably absent. A similar ultrastructural  GBM lesion is found in human beings and Samoyeds with hereditary nephritis,  diseases caused by mutations in the type IV collagen genes. Familial nephropathy  in English Cocker Spaniels may be a form of hereditary nephritis caused by a  mutation in one of the collagen IV genes.","1997-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","80-85","","2","11","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9127294","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/genetics/*pathology; Microscopy, Electron; Basement Membrane/ultrastructure; Capillaries/ultrastructure; Kidney Glomerulus/blood supply/*ultrastructure; Nephritis, Hereditary/genetics/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent studies have demonstrated that the  excellent olfactory function of detection dogs might be related with the gut  microbes via the bidirectional communications between the gastrointestinal tract  and the brain. In this study, the gut microbial communities of three types of  breeds of detection dogs (Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, and German  Shepherd) were studied and compared. The results revealed that the richness and  the diversity of gut microbiome German Shepherd dogs were significantly higher  than the Labrador Retriever dogs and the Springer Spaniel dogs. At the phylum  level, the most predominant gut microbial communities of the detection dogs were  comprised of Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria,  Campilobacterota, and Actinobacteriota. At the genus level the most predominant  gut microbial communities were comprised of Fusobacterium, Megamonas, Prevotella,  Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Haemophilus, Anaerobiospirillum, Helicobacter,  Megasphaera, Peptoclostridium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus. However,  the gut microbial communities of the three dogs group were also obviously  different. The mean relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella,  Alloprevotella, Megamonas, Bacteroides, and Phascolarctobacterium presented  significant differences in the three groups. According to the portraits and  characteristics of the gut microbiome in young detection dogs, multiple kinds of  nutritional interventions could be applied to manipulate the gut microbiota, with  the aim of improving the health states and the olfactory performances.","2022","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","872230","","","13","","Front Microbiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Li, Sun, Li, Guan, Wei, Li, Liu, Shao, Mi, Liu, Qiu and Ma.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35516435  PMCID: PMC9063727","","","","detection dog; German Shepherd; gut microbiota; Labrador Retriever; olfactory function; Springer Spaniel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: 17 healthy privately owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 10  males and 7 females, ranging in age from 0.4 to 9.7 years, and ranging in body  weight from 6.6 to 12.2 kg. PROCEDURE: The clinical condition of the dogs was  evaluated by physical examination, thoracic radiography, and echocardiography.  Plasma nitrate and nitrite (P-NN), N-terminal atrial natriuretic and brain  natriuretic peptides (NT-ANP and BNP, respectively), endothelin (ET-1), urine  cyclic guanosine monophosphate (U-cGMP), and urine nitrate and nitrite (U-NN)  concentrations were analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of NT-ANP and P-NN  increased significantly with age, but plasma NT-ANP and P-NN also correlated  significantly, irrespective of age. A modest increase of left atrial size did not  explain the increase of NT-ANP and P-NN with age. Concentration of ET-1  correlated positively with heart rate; heart rate did not change with age. Weight  had a negative impact on NT-ANP, P-NN, and U-cGMP concentrations and left atrial  relative size. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Age-matched controls are  essential for evaluation of NT-ANP and P-NN concentrations and left atrial size.  Weight may alter reference values of plasma NT-ANP, P-NN, and urine cGMP  concentrations. Natriuretic peptides can be used as further evidence that heart  failure exists. The increased plasma concentrations of NT-ANP (but not BNP) and  P-NN with aging reflect neurohumoral physiologic changes that must be  distinguished from pathologic changes in patients with heart failure.","2001-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1818-1824","","11","62","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11703030","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; Body Weight; Age Factors; Creatinine/urine; Electrocardiography/veterinary; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*blood/urine; Cardiac Output; Cyclic GMP/urine; Dogs/blood/*physiology/urine; Endothelin-1/blood; Heart Failure/blood/urine; Heart Rate; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood/urine; Neurotransmitter Agents/blood/urine; Nitrites/blood/urine; Radiography, Thoracic/veterinary; Regression Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several dog breeds are overrepresented in the disease population,  suggesting that a genetic component is involved, although this is likely to be  polygenic. Previous research has implicated CTLA4 as a potential susceptibility  gene. CTLA4 is an important regulator of T cell function and  polymorphisms/mutations in CTLA4 have been associated with a number of autoimmune  phenotypes in both humans and rodent models of autoimmunity. The aim of the  current study was to undertake a case:control association study of CTLA4 promotor  polymorphisms in three dog breeds, cocker spaniels, springer spaniels and West  Highland white terriers (WHWT). RESULTS: Polymorphisms in the CTLA4 promoter were  determined by PCR and sequence-based typing. There were significant associations  with three promoter haplotypes in cocker spaniels (p = 0.003). A series of SNPs  were also associated with hypoadrenocorticism in cocker spaniels and springer  spaniels, including polymorphisms in predicted NFAT and SP1 transcription factor  binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that CTLA4  promotor polymorphisms are associated with this complex genetic disease and  supports an immune mediated aetiopathogenesis of canine hypoadrenocorticism.","2020","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2","","","7","","Canine Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s). 2020.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32835228  PMCID: PMC7371821","","","","Canine; Addison’s; CTLA-4; Hypoadrenocorticism; Promoter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A web-based survey seeking owner information  as to the longevity of their dogs' working life and why they were retired,  euthanised or died. The sample population is six hundred sixty-five dogs.  RESULTS: The median age at which Springer spaniels stopped work was 11 years and  for Cocker spaniels, it was 9 years. The median age for Labrador retrievers was  10 years; for Golden retrievers, 11 years and Flat-coated retrievers, 9.5 years.  Cocker spaniels stopped work at a significantly younger age than Springer  spaniels (p = 0.0003) or Labrador retrievers (p = 0.0407). There was no  significant difference between the other major breeds. The majority of owners  (54.3%) were satisfied with the working lifespan of their dog. Seventy per cent  of dogs were retired, the three most prevalent reasons being lameness (25.2%),  old age (23.7%) and deafness (7.8%). Forty-four dogs died (6.6%) and 158 (24%)  were euthanised, with cancer (58%) being the most common reason.

Their ages at onset of clinical signs were 4, 5, and 18 months. The initial  lesions consisted of erythematous papules and plaques, with corrugated surfaces  in the ear canal and in the inguinal area. Later, papules, scale, and adherent  keratin mounds developed inside the ear, in the inguinal area, around the mouth,  eyes, and anus, and occasionally on the thoracic wall and the limbs. In one case,  the nose was involved and there was accompanying depigmentation. The disease  waxed and waned for the 10-month, 18-month and 3-year periods of observation,  with various treatments proving unsuccessful. Corticosteroids at high doses and  antibiotics appeared to mitigate the severity of the disease. Histopathologic  interpretation enabled classification of the disease process within both  psoriasiform and lichenoid tissue reactions. In view of the apparent breed  predisposition and the gross and microscopic appearance of the lesions, it was  proposed that the name for this disease be lichenoid-psoriasiform dermatosis of  Springer Spaniels. This disease would be clinically classified as seborrhea and  could be differentiated within this group by the presence of erythematous papules  and plaques along with accurate histologic assessment.","1986-10-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","897-901","","8","189","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2945806","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Diagnosis, Differential; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Skin/pathology; Biopsy; Dermatitis, Seborrheic/pathology/*veterinary; Lichen Planus/pathology/*veterinary; Psoriasis/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

American Cocker Spaniels with DCM were  identified using echocardiography, and plasma was analyzed for taurine and  carnitine concentrations. Each dog was randomly assigned to receive either  taurine and carnitine supplementation or placebos. Echocardiograms and clinical  examinations were repeated monthly for 4 months. During this period, the  investigators and owners were blinded with respect to the treatment being  administered. Each dog was weaned off its cardiovascular drugs (furosemide,  digoxin, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) if an echocardiographic  response was identified. At the 4-month time period, each investigator was asked  to decide whether he or she thought his or her patient was receiving placebo or  taurine/carnitine, based on presence or absence of clinical and echocardiographic  improvement. Unblinding then occurred, and dogs receiving placebos were switched  to taurine and carnitine supplementation and followed monthly for 4 additional  months. All dogs were reexamined 6 months after starting supplementation;  survival time and cause of death were recorded for each dog. Data from 3 dogs  were not included because of multiple protocol violations. Each dog had a plasma  taurine concentration < 50 nmol/mL (mean +/- SD for the group 15 +/- 17 nmol/ mL)  at baseline; normal range, 50-180 nmol/mL. The plasma taurine concentration did  not exceed 50 nmol/mL at any time in the dogs receiving placebos (n = 5), but  increased to 357 +/- 157 nmol/mL (range 140-621 nmol/mL) during taurine and  carnitine supplementation (n = 11). Plasma carnitine concentration was within,  only slightly below, or slightly above reported limits of normality at baseline  (29 +/- 15 mumol/L); did not change during placebo administration; and increased  significantly during supplementation (349 +/- 119 mumol/L; n = 11).  Echocardiographic variables did not change during placebo administration. During  supplementation, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and  mitral valve E point-to-septal separation decreased significantly in both groups.  Shortening fraction increased significantly but not into the normal range.  Echocardiographic variables remained improved at 6 months. All dogs were  successfully weaned off furosemide, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,  and digoxin once an echocardiographic response was identified. Nine of the dogs  have died since the onset of the study in 1992. One dog died of recurrence of DCM  and heart failure 31 months after starting supplementation; six dogs died of  noncardiac causes. Two dogs developed degenerative mitral valve disease and died  of complications of this disease. Dogs less than 10 years of age lived for 46 +/-  11 months, whereas dogs older than 10 years of age lived for 14 +/- 7 months. Two  of the 11 dogs were alive at the time of publication, having survived for 3.5 and  4.5 years, respectively. We conclude that ACS with DCM are taurine-deficient and  are responsive to taurine and carnitine supplementation. Whereas myocardial  function did not return to normal in most dogs, it did improve enough to allow  discontinuation of cardiovascular drug therapy and to maintain a normal quality  of life for months to years.","1997-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","204-211","","4","11","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9298474","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Echocardiography/methods/veterinary; Administration, Oral; Analysis of Variance; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/blood/drug therapy/*veterinary; Carnitine/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use; Dog Diseases/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology; Electrocardiography/methods/veterinary; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/mortality/physiopathology/*veterinary; Myocardium/chemistry/pathology; Single-Blind Method; Taurine/administration & dosage/*blood/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histological features of chronic  hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels. ANIMALS: Thirteen cases examined  from 2003 to 2009. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were searched  for American Cocker Spaniels with chronic liver diseases. History, physical  examination, clinicopathologic features, hepatic ultrasonographic findings,  hepatic histopathology, and immunohistochemistry were evaluated. RESULTS: The  median age was 4.6 (1.9-10.7) years. Clinical signs included inappetence (11/13),  ascites (11/13), lethargy (9/13), diarrhea (7/13), and melena (2/13). Only 1/13  dogs was jaundiced. Clinicopathological abnormalities were increased liver  enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase: 9/12, aspartate aminotransferase: 7/10,  alanine aminotransferase: 6/13, alkaline phosphatase: 6/13), increased total  serum bile acid concentrations (10/12), and hypoalbuminemia (10/13). The liver  had an irregular surface in all dogs and acquired portosystemic collaterals were  verified in 11/13 dogs by abdominal ultrasound (2), laparoscopy (4), or both (5).  Liver histology revealed severe fibrosis and cirrhosis in all cases, subdivided  in lobular dissecting hepatitis (7), periportal fibrosis (1), micronodular  cirrhosis (3), and macronocular cirrhosis (2). Inflammatory activity was low to  mild. Immunohistochemical stains showed ductular proliferation. The median  survival time was 913 (range: 63-1981) days. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:  Hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels is clinically silent until an  advanced stage and is associated with severe hepatic fibrosis leading to  cirrhosis, extensive ductular/putative hepatic progenitor cell proliferation,  portal hypertension, and acquired portosystemic collateral shunting, but  relatively long survival times. Lobular dissecting hepatitis seems more prevalent  than in previously reported cases from other countries.","2013-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1041-1048","","5","27","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23782303","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Breed-related hepatitis; Dog Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology; Hepatitis, Chronic/epidemiology/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Japan/epidemiology; Liver progenitor cells; Portal hypertension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Affected dogs were part of approximately 500 American Cocker Spaniels examined  from 1972 to 1976 in statewide survey clinics for inherited cataracts and  progressive retinal atrophy. The dysplastic retina was observable  ophthalmoscopically in dogs as young as 3 to 4 weeks and as old as 7 years.  Ophthalmoscopic features varied, depending on whether the dysplastic foci were in  the tapetal or non-tapetal portion of the fundus. Over the tapetum, dysplastic  foci appeared as multiple small irregularities of diminished and altered tapetal  reflectivity. In the non-tapetal fundus, dysplasia appeared as areas of decreased  pigmentation. Blindness or other apparent visual deficits were not observed in  affected dogs. Histologic examination of affected eyes revealed focal dysplasia  limited to the retina and optic nerve. Abnormalities included localized areas of  retinal folding, rosettes, and retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy and  hyperplasia. Pedigree analysis demonstrated that 71 of the 96 affected dogs were  related and could be identified in an extended pedigree. A recessive mode of  inheritance was suggested, because in 5 litters (born to 10 affected parents),  all 23 progeny that lived were affected. A dominant or polygenic mode of  inheritance could not be ruled out.","1978-03-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","568-572","","5","172","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 632194","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Dog Diseases/*genetics/pathology; Retina/*abnormalities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a  technique that defines subtle microstructural changes in the course of many brain  and spinal cord diseases, that are not visible on standard MRI. The aim of the  study was to identify the correlation between the presence of clinical symptoms  and DTI parameters, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional  anisotropy (FA) within the spinal cord in the course of CM-SM. Study subjects  included 18 dogs, CKCS with MRI-confirmed SM (SM group), and 12 CKCS dogs without  SM (non-SM group). The SM group was divided into SM-symptomatic group (n = 8) and  SM-asymptomatic group, n = 10). All dogs underwent same clinical and neurological  assessment followed by MRI examination. All MRI studies were performed on a 1.5T  MRI scanner. The MRI spine protocol included: transverse and sagittal T2-weighted  images followed by DTI performed in the sagittal plane. The measurements of FA  and ADC values were performed manually using the region of interest (ROI) method  at the level of three intervertebral discs between C1 and C4. Notable differences  in age and body weight were found. No significant differences in FA and ADC  values between the SM and non-SM groups were found, but between non-SM,  SM-asymptomatic and SM-symptomatic groups significant differences were found in  ADC values in all three ROIs and in FA values in ROI-1 and ROI-3. SM-symptomatic  dogs compared to non-SM, showed decreased FA value in ROI-1 and ROI-3 also  increased ADC value in ROI-1, ROI-2 and ROI-3. SM-symptomatic dogs compared to  SM-asymptomatic showed also decreased FA value in ROI-1 and ROI-3, and also  increased ADC value in ROI-1, ROI-2 and ROI-3. The results suggest that the  values of DTI parameters correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms in the  course of CM-SM in animals. The use of DTI evaluation of CM-SM patients carries a  potential value as a clinically relevant protocol for an objective assessment of  the spinal cord.","2022-12-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","23","12","","Animals (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36496926  PMCID: PMC9740166","","","","Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS); Chiari malformation (CM); diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); syringomyelia (SM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Severity of mitral  incompetence was assessed by echocardiography. Significant differences in plasma  concentrations of ir-ANP were not found between clinically normal dogs (New York  Heart Association functional class O), dogs with only cardiac murmur (class I),  and dogs with echocardiographic evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and  ventricular dilatation (class II). Dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular  dilatation and clinical signs of congestion (classes III and IV) were found to  have significantly (P < 0.001) increased plasma concentration of ir-ANP. Overall,  moderate degree of association was found between plasma concentration of ir-ANP  and left atrial and left ventricular diameters (Pearson's r = 0.65, 0.60,  respectively, P < 0.001), as well as heart rate (r = 0.47, P < 0.01). However,  left atrial enlargement was found to have the predominant effect on plasma ir-ANP  concentration. It is concluded that the plasma concentration of ir-ANP did not  become markedly increased before decompensation of chronic mitral regurgitation  associated with severe enlargement of the left atrium and ventricle in Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels.","1994-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","698-703","","5","55","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8067620","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; *Dog Diseases; Echocardiography/methods/veterinary; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*veterinary; Heart Rate; Regression Analysis; Analysis of Variance; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/analysis/*blood; Biomarkers/blood; Heart Failure/blood/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to uncover variants  underlying risk for xanthinuria in dogs. Affected dogs included two Manchester  Terriers, three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, an English Cocker Spaniel, a  Dachshund, and a mixed-breed dog. Four putative causal variants were discovered:  an XDH c.654G > A splice site variant that results in skipping of exon 8  (mixed-breed dog), a MOCOS c.232G > T splice site variant that results in  skipping of exon 2 (Manchester Terriers), a MOCOS p.Leu46Pro missense variant  (Dachshund), and a MOCOS p.Ala128Glyfs*30 frameshift variant that results in a  premature stop codon (Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and English Cocker Spaniel).  The two splice site variants suggest that the regions skipped are critical to the  respective enzyme function, though protein misfolding is an alternative theory  for loss of function. The MOCOS p.Leu46Pro variant has not been previously  reported in human or other animal cases and provides novel data supporting this  residue as critical to MOCOS function. All variants were present in the  homozygous state in affected dogs, indicating an autosomal recessive mode of  inheritance. Allele frequencies of these variants in breed-specific populations  ranged from 0 to 0.18. In conclusion, multiple diverse variants appear to be  responsible for hereditary xanthinuria in dogs.","2021-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","100792","","","29","","Mol Genet Metab Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34584846  PMCID: PMC8455477","","","","Canine genetics; CKCS, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel; DACH, Dachshund; DBVDC, Dog Biomedical Variant Database Consortium; ECS, English Cocker Spaniel; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; Hereditary xanthinuria; Kidney stones; MOCOS, molybdenum cofactor sulfurase; Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase; MT, Manchester Terrier; MUC, Minnesota Urolith Center; MX, mixed breed; Nephrolithiasis; OMIM, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man; Xanthine dehydrogenase; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A similar syndrome has  been described in English Springer Spaniel littermates with an early onset of  anemia, megaesophagus, generalized muscle atrophy and cardiomyopathy. Muscle  histopathology in both breeds showed distinctive pathological changes consistent  with congenital polymyopathy. Using whole genome sequencing and mapping to the  CanFam4 (Canis lupus familiaris reference assembly 4), a nonsense variant in the  EHBP1L1 gene was identified in a homozygous form in the Labrador Retriever  littermates. The mutation produces a premature stop codon that deletes  approximately 90% of the protein. This variant was not present in the English  Springer Spaniels. Currently, EHPB1L1 is described as critical to actin  cytoskeletal organization and apical-directed transport in polarized epithelial  cells, and through connections with Rab8 and a BIN1-dynamin complex generates  membrane vesicles in the endocytic recycling compartment. Furthermore, EHBP1L1  knockout mice die early and develop severe anemia. The connection of EHBP1L1 to  BIN1 and DMN2 functions is particularly interesting due to BIN1 and DMN2  mutations being causative in forms of centronuclear myopathy. This report, along  with an independent study conducted by another group, are the first reports of an  association of EHBP1L1 mutations with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and  polymyopathy.","2022-08-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","8","13","","Genes (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36011338  PMCID: PMC9407898","","","","Animals; Dogs; dog; Mutation; whole genome sequencing; *Anemia, Dyserythropoietic, Congenital/genetics; *Myopathies, Structural, Congenital/genetics; anemia; animal model; Codon, Nonsense; Mice; muscle; Muscular Atrophy; myopathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was hypothesised that breeds with skull  shapes that differ most in conformation from the moderate mesocephalic skull  shape have higher odds of periodontal disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cohort  study included a random sample of dogs under primary veterinary care in 2016 from  the VetCompass Programme database. Risk factor analysis used random effects  multivariable logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: The study included a random  sample of 22,333 dogs. The 1-year period prevalence for diagnosis with  periodontal disease was 12.52% (95% CI: 12.09 to 12.97). Eighteen breeds showed  increased odds compared with crossbred dogs. Breeds with the highest odds  included Toy Poodle (odds ratio 3.97, 95% confidence intervals 2.21 to 7.13),  King Charles Spaniel (odds ratio 2.63, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 4.61),  Greyhound (odds ratio 2.58, 95% confidence interval 1.75 to 3.80) and Cavalier  King Charles Spaniel (odds ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.85 to 3.09).  Four breeds showed reduced odds compared with crossbreds. Brachycephalic breeds  had 1.25 times the odds (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.42) of periodontal  disease compared with mesocephalic breeds. Spaniel types had 1.63 times the odds  (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 1.87) compared with non-spaniel types.  Increasing adult bodyweight was associated with progressively decreasing odds of  periodontal disease.

The term distichiasis  originates from the Greek words di and stichos meaning two and rows,  respectively, and as the name implies, the condition is characterized by an  additional row of cilia, which erupts on the eyelid margin. Many purebred dogs  are known to be predisposed to the condition, with many affected individuals  within the populations. Even though the problem is widespread, the exact mode of  inheritance and the heredity has not been studied extensively. However, some  degree of genetic influence has been assumed, due to the high incidences within  specific breeds. In the present study we have examined a cohort of English Cocker  spaniels in Denmark to determine the prevalence and heritability of the disease.  RESULTS: Data from English Cocker spaniels with an ECVO eye examination  registered between 2004-2013 were included in the study. The number of dogs  examined during this period was 799, and the prevalence of distichiasis within  this cohort was estimated at 49.31 % with a gender predisposition that females  are more likely to get distichiasis than males. The correlation between the  distichiasis status of the parents and their offspring revealed a significant  association between the breeding combination of the parents and the occurrence of  distichiasis in the offspring (p <0.0001). A relative risk (RR) ranging from 1.3  to 1.8 demonstrates that offspring of two affected parents are more likely to be  affected than offspring descending from either one or two unaffected parents. The  heritability was estimated to be moderate to high, i.e., 0.22 to 0.51.  CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of distichiasis in English Cocker spaniels from  Denmark, examined in 2004-2013 was shown to be extremely high. The relative risk  of developing the disease was 1.3 and 1.8 for offspring of one or two affected  parents respectively. This together with the moderate to high heritability of the  condition indicates that selective breeding could be used to reduce the incidence  of distichiasis.","2015","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","11","","","2","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26401339  PMCID: PMC4579384","","","","Prevalence; Canine; Cocker spaniel; Genetics; Distichiasis; Heredity; Inheritance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fractionated, normal  Beagle lens βH-crystallins were separated by one- or two-dimensional  electrophoresis. The separated lens βH-crystallins were used on immunoblots as  sentinel substrates against which the ACS sera were tested for the presence of  antibodies against βH-crystallins. RESULTS: Sera from approximately two-thirds of  study animals contained antibodies to some βH-crystallin polypeptides, but  reactivity varied among patients. Contrary to some hypotheses, serum antibodies  to groups of βH-crystallins did not relate to the stages of cataract. However,  detailed analysis by two-dimensional immunoblotting and mass spectrometry showed  that three spots originating from βA1-crystallin were detected only in sera from  cataract patients.

The clinical manifestations, pattern of  inheritance, electrodiagnostic findings, and muscle biopsies have features in  common with human spinal muscular atrophy. Neuropathological examination  discloses some loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. Many of  the surviving motor neurons have neurofibrillary swellings in proximal axons, an  abnormality similar to that which occurs early in the course of human amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis. These axonal swellings are filled with maloriented skeins of  neurofilaments. Since the proteins comprising neurofilaments are carried by slow  axonal transport, their accumulation within axons suggest that the swellings may  result from impaired slow transport, a hypothesis that can be tested in affected  Brittany Spaniels. Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy is a new genetic,  clinical, and pathological entity, and, at present, it appears to be the best  currently available animal model of motor neuron disease.","1979-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","209-221","","3","38","","J Neuropathol Exp Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 438862","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Pedigree; Spinal Cord/pathology; *Motor Neurons/pathology; Brain Stem/pathology; Hypoglossal Nerve/pathology; Muscles/innervation/pathology; Muscular Atrophy/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Neurofibrils/pathology; Neuromuscular Diseases/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Spinal Cord Diseases/genetics/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  patterning in the coat can be modified by other factors to produce the attractive  phenotypes termed 'ticked' and 'roan' that describe the presence of flecks of  color that vary in distribution and intensity within otherwise 'clear' white  markings. The appearance of the pigment in the white patterning caused by ticking  and roaning intensifies in the weeks after birth. We applied genome-wide  association to compare English Cocker Spaniels of roan phenotype (N = 34) with  parti-color (non-roan) English Cocker Spaniels (N = 9) and identified an  associated locus on CFA 38, CFA38:11 057 040 (P(raw)  = 8.9 × 10(-10) , P(genome)  = 2.7 × 10(-5) ). A local case-control association in English Springer Spaniels  comparing 11 ticked and six clear dogs identified indicative association with a  different haplotype, CFA38:11 122 467G>T (P(raw)  = 1.7 × 10(-5) ) and CFA38:11  124 294A>C (P(raw)  = 1.7 × 10(-5) ). We characterize three haplotypes in  Spaniels according to their putative functional variant profiles at CFA38:11 111  286C>T (missense), CFA38:11 131 841-11 143 239DUP.insTTAA (using strongly linked  marker CFA38:11 143 243C>T) and CFA38:11 156 425T>C (splice site). In Spaniels,  the haplotypes work as an allelic series including alleles (t, recessive clear;  T, dominant ticked/parti-color; and T(R) , incomplete dominant roan) to control  the appearance of pigmented spots or flecks in otherwise white areas of the  canine coat. In Spaniels the associated haplotypes are t (CCT), T (TCC) and T(R)  (TTT) for SNP markers on CFA38 at 11 111 286C>T, 11 143 243C>T and 11 156 425T>C  respectively. It is likely that other alleles exist in this series and together  the haplotypes result in a complex range of patterning that is only visible when  dogs have white patterning resulting from the epistatic gene  Micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (the S-locus).","2021-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","198-207","","2","52","","Anim Genet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

ANIMALS: 76 clinically  healthy CKCSs and 24 control dogs. PROCEDURE: All dogs underwent  echocardiographic examination; various hemostatic, hematologic, and biochemical  variables were evaluated in blood. The CKCSs were allocated to 1 of 3 groups on  the basis of MR severity. In 8 control dogs and 8 CKCSs, plasma von Willebrand  factor (vWF) multimer analysis was performed. RESULTS: Compared with control  dogs, plasma fibrinogen concentration was higher in all CKCSs and related to left  ventricular end diastolic diameter and left atrial-to-aortic root ratio among all  CKCSs. The activated partial thromboplastin times and plasma D-dimer  concentration were similar among the 4 groups. Plasma vWF concentration was lower  in CKCSs with moderate to severe MR, compared with that of CKCSs with no MR and  control dogs. There was a relationship between plasma vWF concentration and  platelet function in CKCSs but not in control dogs. In 4 CKCSs with moderate to  severe MR and low plasma vWF concentration, amounts of vWF high-molecular-weight  multimers (HMWMs) were low. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In CKCSs, MR  appeared to be associated with a low plasma vWF concentration and likely a loss  of vWF HMWMs (possibly through their destruction via shear stress to the blood).  The importance of the changes in plasma fibrinogen concentration and the  thromboembolic risk in dogs with MR remain to be investigated.","2004-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1644-1652","","12","65","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15631028","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*blood; *Mitral Valve; Electrocardiography/veterinary; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/veterinary; Biomarkers/*blood; Fibrinogen/metabolism; Heart Valve Diseases/blood/*veterinary; Hemostasis/*physiology; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/blood/veterinary; Partial Thromboplastin Time/veterinary; Prothrombin Time/veterinary; von Willebrand Factor/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of cavalier King  Charles spaniels diagnosed with middle ear effusion and treated with tympanostomy  tubes placement between 2012 and 2014 was performed. Outcome was assessed based  on a telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-two tympanostomy tubes were  successfully placed in the tympanic membrane in 12 cavalier King Charles spaniels  under video-otoscopic guidance using a rigid endoscope and grasping forceps.  Follow-up based on an owner questionnaire was available for 11/12 dogs.  Subjective improvement in hearing was observed in 9/11 dogs with three dogs  achieving normal hearing, according to the owners, and six demonstrating partial  improvements. Out of 11 dogs, 10 dogs were reported with improved quality of  life. Pruritus of the ears resolved in 3/9 dogs. Clinical signs recurred in four  dogs because of tube dislodgement.

Semi-quantitative analysis  revealed high urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine in the patient  and his female littermate. Quantitative analysis by high-pressure liquid  chromatography (HPLC) of the urine samples from the family of this Cavalier King  Charles spaniel and nine control dogs revealed that hypoxanthine and xanthine  excretion was 30 and 60 times higher in the affected patient and the female  littermate than in the others dogs. The pattern of xanthinuria, which is caused  by a deficiency of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, in the relation diagram of this  family of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels was consistent with an autosomal  recessive mode of inheritance.","1997-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","172-174","","4","19","","Vet Q","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9413115","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Pedigree; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/veterinary; Dog Diseases/genetics/metabolism/*urine; Hypoxanthine/metabolism/urine; Renal Insufficiency/metabolism/urine/*veterinary; Urethral Obstruction/metabolism/urine/*veterinary; Uric Acid/metabolism/urine; Urinary Calculi/chemistry/urine/*veterinary; Xanthine/analysis/metabolism/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous medical history included a high-grade soft  tissue spindle cell sarcoma removed from the cranial sternal region one year  before. On presentation at the referral hospital, the dog was tachypneic and  dyspneic. The heart rhythm was regular and there was a soft left-sided systolic  murmur. Echocardiography identified the presence of a mass significantly  occluding left heart inflow, with no other lesions identified. Thoracic  radiographs documented a localized alveolar pattern within the left caudal lung  lobe. The size of the heart and pulmonary vessels were within normal limits,  indicating a non-cardiogenic alveolar pattern. Given the clinical presentation of  dyspnea and high index of suspicion of intra-cardiac neoplasia, the dog was  considered to have a grave prognosis and therefore euthanized. Post-mortem gross  and histopathologic examination revealed the presence of a metastatic  osteosarcoma tumor thrombus in the left atrium and pulmonary vein, metastatic  osteosarcoma infiltrating the myocardium, lungs, the uveal tract of the right  eye, and both adrenal glands. Whitney grade II myxomatous changes were noted on  the mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets. This report describes an unusual  intra-cardiac tumor thrombus in a dog presenting with dyspnea. Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels presenting with dyspnea often raise suspicion for myxomatous  mitral valve disease. However, as demonstrated in this case, other more unusual  causes of dyspnea should also be considered in the absence of classic clinical  findings.","2022-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","209-215","","","41","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This study estimates prevalence, breed  associations and other risk factors as well as reporting on clinical management.  METHODS: A cohort study of dogs attending VetCompass practices between 1 January  2013 and 31 December 2013. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic  regression methods. RESULTS: Of 104,212 dogs attending 110 UK practices, the  1-year period prevalence of ASD was 4.40% (95% CI: 4.22-4.57). Compared to  crossbreds, six breeds showed increased odds of ASD (Cavalier King Charles  spaniel, King Charles spaniel, Cockapoo, Shih-tzu, Bichon Frise and Cocker  spaniel), and six breeds showed reduced odds (Labrador Retriever, Border collie,  Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Lurcher, German Shepherd Dog and Boxer).  Brachycephalic types had 2.6 times the odds for ASD compared to dolichocephalic  types. Medication prescribed for ASD included antimicrobials (n = 480, 20.24%)  and analgesics (n = 284, 11.97%). Anal sacculectomy was performed in under 1% of  cases. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence, strong breed predispositions and evidence of  severity suggested from the antimicrobial and analgesic therapies combined with  current substantial knowledge gaps identify ASD as a key research-neglected  syndrome in dogs.","2021-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e203","","2","189","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

ANIMALS STUDIED: Six American Cocker Spaniels with PACG and six  American Cocker Spaniels without ocular diseases. METHODS: Aqueous humor samples  were collected from six American Cocker Spaniels with PACG at Seoul National  University, VMTH, and six healthy Cocker Spaniels without ocular disease at Irion  Animal Hospital. For the PACG group, AH samples were obtained by anterior chamber  paracentesis prior to glaucoma treatment. For the AH control group, AH samples  were collected from patients anesthetized for other reasons. Total AH protein  concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. AH protein  samples were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  Raw MS spectra were processed using MaxQuant software 30, and the Gene Ontology  (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using ClueGO. RESULTS: The AH protein  concentration in the PACG group (10.49 ± 17.98 µg/µl) was significantly higher  than that of the control group (0.45 ± 0.11 µg/µl; p < .05). A total of 758  proteins were identified in the AH. Several proteins both significantly increased  (n = 69) and decreased (n = 252) in the PACG group compared to those in the  control group. GO enrichment analysis showed that the ""response to wounding,""  ""negative regulation of endopeptidase activity,"" and ""cell growth"" pathways were  the most enriched terms in the PACG group compared to the control group. The top  5 proteins that were significantly increased in the AH of the PACG group were  secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), peptidoglycan recognition proteins 2 (PGLYRP2),  tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (YWHAE), maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM), and vimentin  (VIM). CONCLUSIONS: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the proteomic data  showed that proteins and pathways related to inflammation were significantly  upregulated in the various stage of PACG. Proteomic analysis of the AH from the  PACG may provide valuable insights into PACG pathogenesis.","2021-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","520-532","","5","24","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34558166","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; dog; angle-closure glaucoma; aqueous humor; Aqueous Humor/*metabolism; Biomarkers/metabolism; Dog Diseases/*metabolism; Eye Proteins/*metabolism; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure/metabolism/*veterinary; LC-MS/MS; proteomics; Proteomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  Hereditary nephropathy has been described in this breed since the late 1940s. To  date, there are no data on the prevalence of this disease in Brazil, so the aim  of this study was to evaluate the allelic frequency of this mutation in ECS dogs  in this country. The DNA samples were purified from blood samples or buccal swabs  from 221 ECS dogs. Fragments of the DNA containing the mutation were amplified by  PCR and submitted to direct gene sequencing. The allele frequency of the mutation  was 0.9%. The presence of the mutation in the ECS dog population in Brazil  reveals the importance of performing the genotyping tests in these dogs as a  method of diagnosing the disease and identifying heterozygous animals, aiming to  reduce clinical cases of disease through mating.","2020-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","100114","","","9","","Vet Anim Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 32734115  PMCID: PMC7386716","","","","COL4A4; Diagnosis; Genetic disease; Genotyping; Hereditary nephropathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five dogs had repeat radiographs, of which four  showed no change in the pattern and one developed the pattern 6 years after being  diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis. Serum calcium concentrations were normal in  all patients. Liver enzymes were markedly elevated only in the dog diagnosed with  cholangiohepatitis. Histology performed on three patients showed no convincing  evidence of primary liver disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Branching  mineralisation in the liver parenchyma is a rare finding in dogs with little or  no clinical significance and cavalier King Charles spaniels may be predisposed.

METHODS: In a prospective study,  gonioscopy was performed in both eyes of 227 Welsh springer spaniels and  intraocular pressure measured by rebound tonometry. Eyes were classified as  ""unaffected"" if 0% of the iridocorneal angle was affected with pectinate ligament  dysplasia (grade 0), ""mildly affected"" if <20% was affected (grade 1),  ""moderately affected"" if 20 to 90% was affected (grade 2) and ""severely affected""  if >90% was affected (grade 3). In a retrospective study, progression of  pectinate ligament dysplasia over time was investigated for 65 dogs. RESULTS: One  hundred and thirty-nine of 227 dogs (61·2%) were affected by pectinate ligament  dysplasia (grades 1 to 3) and 82/227 (36·2%) were moderately or severely  affected. There was a significant association between pectinate ligament  dysplasia and age. There were no associations between pectinate ligament  dysplasia and intraocular pressure or pectinate ligament dysplasia and sex.  Thirty-five of 65 dogs (53·8%) demonstrated progression of pectinate ligament  dysplasia. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Prevalence of pectinate ligament dysplasia was  high despite widespread screening and selection against the condition. Our data  indicate that gonioscopic features of pectinate ligament dysplasia can progress  in the Welsh springer spaniel.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 80 dogs with severe otitis externa  that required total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy. PROCEDURE:  Medical records were reviewed for breed, sex, and age at time of surgery.  Histologic specimens from the horizontal ear canal were evaluated by a single  examiner for overall tissue response pattern and scored for sebaceous gland  hyperplasia, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland ectasia, fibrosis,  pigment-laden macrophages, and osseous metaplasia. RESULTS: 48 of 80 (60%) dogs  were Cocker Spaniels. Thirty-five of 48 (72.9%) Cocker Spaniels had a  predominately ceruminous tissue response pattern; only 9 of 32 (28.1 %) dogs of  other breeds had the same pattern. Other breeds most commonly had a pattern  dominated by fibrosis (n = 13 [40.6%]); fibrosis was the predominant pattern in  only 4 of 48 (8.3%) Cocker Spaniels. Discriminant analysis and K-means clustering  of 4 histopathologic criteria correctly classified 75% of the dogs as Cocker  Spaniels or all other breeds. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cocker Spaniels  are at increased risk for chronic severe otitis externa requiring total ear canal  ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy, indicating that earlier and more  aggressive management of the primary otitis externa and secondary inflammation is  warranted in this breed. Cocker Spaniels with chronic severe otitis externa have  distinct differences in pathologic characteristics of the horizontal ear canal,  compared with other breeds.","2002-10-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1000-1006","","7","221","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12369678","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Treatment Outcome; Chronic Disease; Cluster Analysis; Discriminant Analysis; Dog Diseases/*genetics/*pathology/surgery; Ear Canal/*anatomy & histology; Osteotomy/veterinary; Otitis Externa/genetics/pathology/surgery/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Temporomandibular joint  conformation differed between breeds. Mid- and small-sized dogs had mandibular  fossae that were more shallow, less developed retroarticular processes, and  irregularly shaped condylar processes.

METHODS: Medical records of 149 dogs which met predetermined  inclusion criteria were evaluated retrospectively. Correlations between pathogens  and the presence of allergy, endocrinopathy, conformational abnormalities and  signalment were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: The shar-pei, German shepherd  and cocker spaniel breeds were over-represented compared with the hospital's  breed distribution (P<0·001). German shepherd dogs and cocker spaniels were  statistically more prone to infection with rod-shaped organisms and Labrador  retrievers less than other breeds (P=0·034).

However, the mechanism by which SM  develops in this breed has not been fully elucidated and the associated effects  on spinal cord structure have not been reported previously. The aims of this  study were to describe changes found in the spinal cord of CKCSs, to compare  findings between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and to determine whether  syrinx formation was associated with tissue destruction. Anomalies of the central  canal were found in all specimens and many dogs had grossly visible fluid-filled  cavities within the spinal cord. Prominent microscopical findings were spongy  degenerative changes associated with neuronal necrosis and Wallerian  degeneration. The ependyma was discontinuous in many specimens, notably in  symptomatic individuals, and there was evidence of angiogenesis and fibrous  tissue proliferation around blood vessels adjacent to syrinx cavities. Compared  with two different samples of the normal dog population, dogs with syrinxes had  significantly less grey matter, although this decrease was associated with  generalized loss of spinal cord area. Therefore, SM is associated with  degenerative changes in the spinal cord and may develop through primary  disruption of ependymal integrity followed by vascular hypertrophy and  proliferation. Glial and fibrous proliferation appears to be associated with  expression of clinical signs.","2012-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","192-201","","2-3","146","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ANIMALS: One hundred thirty-four English Cocker Spaniels (12  with ARHN, 8 obligate carriers, and 114 others), 3 mixed breed dogs with X-linked  hereditary nephropathy (XLHN), and 7 other dogs without hereditary nephropathy  were included. METHODS: Diagnosis of ARHN was based on transmission electron  microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. Quantitative real time reverse  transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to compare COL4A3,  COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA concentrations in the renal cortex from ARHN-affected  English Cocker Spaniels, XLHN-affected dogs, and dogs without hereditary  nephropathy. The entire coding region of COL4A4 was sequenced in 2 ARHN-affected  dogs, 2 obligate carriers, 2 English Cocker Spaniels of unknown status, and 2  healthy mixed breed dogs. The exon containing the mutation was sequenced for all  134 English Cocker Spaniels. RESULTS: Quantitative real time RT-PCR implicated  COL4A4 as the gene harboring the mutation, and sequencing identified a single  nucleotide substitution at base 115 as the cause of ARHN in English Cocker  Spaniels. This mutation, which causes a premature stop codon in exon 3 of COL4A4,  was segregated with clinical status in all affected dogs and obligate carriers.  The mutation also was identified in 39 of 114 other English Cocker Spaniels with  previously unknown status.

Transcriptional profiling can reveal the impact of genetic variation through  differences in gene expression levels. The aim of this study was to determine  whether expression patterns were different in mitral valves showing myxomatous  degeneration from CKCS dogs compared to valves from non-CKCS dogs. RESULTS: Gene  expression patterns in three groups of canine valves resulted in distinct  separation of normal valves, diseased valves from CKCS and diseased valves from  other breeds; the latter were more similar to the normal valves than were the  valves from CKCS. Gene expression patterns in diseased valves from CKCS dogs were  quite different from those in the valves from other dogs, both affected and  normal. Patterns in all diseased valves (from CKCS and other breeds) were also  somewhat different from normal non-diseased samples. Analysis of differentially  expressed genes showed enrichment in GO terms relating to cardiac development and  function and to calcium signalling canonical pathway in the genes down-regulated  in the diseased valves from CKCS, compared to normal valves and to diseased  valves from other breeds. F2 (prothrombin) (CKCS diseased valves compared to  normal) and MEF2C pathway activation (CKCS diseased valves compared to non-CKCS  diseased valves) had the strongest association with the gene changes. A large  number of genes that were differentially expressed in the CKCS diseased valves  compared with normal valves and diseased valves from other breeds were associated  with cardiomyocytes including CASQ2, TNNI3 and RYR2. CONCLUSION: Transcriptomic  profiling identified gene expression changes in CKCS diseased valves that were  not present in age and disease severity-matched non-CKCS valves. These genes are  associated with cardiomyocytes, coagulation and extra-cellular matrix  remodelling. Identification of genes that vary in the CKCS will allow exploration  of genetic variation to understand the aetiology of the disease in this breed,  and ultimately development of breeding strategies to eliminate this disease from  the breed.","2020-09-23","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","350","","1","16","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32967675  PMCID: PMC7509937","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Species Specificity; cavalier King Charles spaniel; Dog Diseases/genetics/*pathology; Heart Valve Diseases/genetics/*veterinary; Mitral Valve/*pathology; Gene clustering; Gene Expression Profiling/*veterinary; Gene networks; Genes expression; Myxomatous mitral valve disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective nested cohort study. SAMPLE POPULATION: One hundred  twelve dogs. METHODS: Medical records of dogs referred between January 2010 and  August 2018 were searched for HCF. Demographics, fracture configuration, repair,  and complications were obtained from medical records. Radiographs were assessed  for fracture reduction, implant positioning, and bone healing. Short-term  radiographic and clinical outcomes, and long-term owner-assessed outcome was  determined. Associations between these variables were statistically analyzed.  RESULTS: Dogs with HCF represented 112 of 43 325 (0.26%, 95% CI 0.22-0.31)  referrals. French bulldogs and spaniel breeds were predisposed to HCF (P < .02).  French bulldogs were 6.58 times (95% CI 1.62-26.7) more likely than other breeds  to have a medial HCF (P = .008). Epicondylar plate fixation was associated with  reduced complications compared with lag screws and Kirschner wires (P = .009).

Lymph node cytology, histopathology or both  demonstrated mixed inflammatory (27%), pyogranulomatous (24%), neutrophilic (20%)  or granulomatous (11%) lymphadenitis. Treatment details were available for 38  dogs, with 34 receiving prednisolone for a median duration of 15 weeks (range: 1  to 28 weeks). A good to excellent clinical response was reported in all but one  case. Ten dogs relapsed after discontinuing prednisolone. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:  Idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis should be considered as a differential  diagnosis for lymphadenopathy and pyrexia in English springer spaniels. The  characteristics of the disease, absence of identifiable infectious aetiology and  response to glucocorticoid therapy suggest an immune-mediated aetiology.","2019-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","551-558","","9","60","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Authors Journal of Small Animal Practice published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Small Animal Veterinary Association.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31317549","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; *Dog Diseases; Lymphadenitis/*veterinary; Lymph Nodes; Prednisolone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of 2860 working dogs, 13.5 per cent sustained at least one tail injury  during the 2010/2011 shooting season. Undocked spaniels and hunt point retrievers  (HPRs) were at greatest risk of tail injury with 56.6 per cent of undocked  spaniels and 38.5 per cent of undocked HPRs sustaining at least one tail injury  during the season. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk  of tail injury in dogs with tails docked by one-third, half or shorter. To  prevent one tail injury in one shooting season, between two and 18 spaniels or  HPRs would need to be docked as puppies. The authors believe that this work  provides the best available evidence on which to base a consultation for changes  to the legislation on tail docking in working dogs in Scotland. Docking the tails  of HPRs and spaniels by one-third would significantly decrease the risk of tail  injury sustained while working in these breeds.","2014-05-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","451","","18","174","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24706392","","","","Animals; Species Specificity; Data Collection; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Dogs/*injuries/surgery; Risk Assessment; Scotland/epidemiology; Tail/*injuries/surgery; Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examination of one of these revealed complete retinal  detachment. A presumptive diagnosis of retinal dysplasia (RD) was provided and  pedigree analysis was suggestive of an X-linked mode of inheritance. We sought to  investigate the genetic basis of RD in this family of ECS. METHODS: Following  whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the one remaining male RD-affected ECS, two  distinct investigative approaches were employed: a candidate gene approach and a  whole genome approach. In the candidate gene approach, COL9A2, COL9A3, NHEJ1, RS1  and NDP genes were investigated based on their known associations with RD and  retinal detachment in dogs and humans. In the whole genome approach, affected WGS  was compared with 814 unaffected canids to identify candidate variants, which  were filtered based on appropriate segregation and predicted pathogenic effects  followed by subsequent investigation of gene function. Candidate variants were  tested for appropriate segregation in the ECS family and association with disease  was assessed using samples from a total of 180 ECS. RESULTS: The same variant in  NDP (c.653_654insC, p.Met114Hisfs*16) that was predicted to result in 15 aberrant  amino acids before a premature stop in norrin protein, was identified  independently by both approaches and was shown to segregate appropriately within  the ECS family. Association of this variant with X-linked RD was significant (P =  0.0056). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we report a variant associated with  canine X-linked RD. NDP variants are already known to cause X-linked RD, along  with other abnormalities, in human Norrie disease. Thus, the dog may serve as a  useful large animal model for research.","2021","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0251071","","5","16","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 33945575  PMCID: PMC8096109","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Pedigree; Phenotype; Eye Proteins/*genetics; Blindness/congenital/genetics; Genes, X-Linked/*genetics; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/genetics; Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics; Nervous System Diseases/genetics; Retinal Degeneration/genetics; Retinal Detachment/genetics; Retinal Dysplasia/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is rare in the overall dog population but shows a breed-related predisposition with  Standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs having a greater prevalence of the  condition. It shares many similarities with human primary adrenal insufficiency  and is believed to be a naturally occurring, spontaneous model for the human  condition. Short haplotype blocks and low levels of linkage disequilibrium in the  human genome mean that the identification of genetic contributors to the  condition requires large sample numbers. Pedigree dogs have high linkage  disequilibrium and long haplotypes within a breed, increasing the potential of  identifying novel genes that contribute to canine genetic disease. We  investigated 222 SNPs from 42 genes that have been associated or may be  implicated in human Addison's disease. We conducted case-control analyses in 3  pedigree dog breeds (Labrador retriever: affected n = 30, unaffected = 76; Cocker  Spaniel: affected n = 19, unaffected = 53; Springer spaniel: affected n = 26,  unaffected = 46) and identified 8 associated alleles in genes COL4A4, OSBPL9,  CTLA4, PTPN22, and STXBP5 in 3 pedigree breeds. Association with immune response  genes PTPN22 and CTLA4 in certain breeds suggests an underlying  immunopathogenesis of the disease.

Pathology results from  immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex, which is similar to that seen  in the human Addison's disease. Both the canine and human diseases have similar  clinical presentation, with the diagnosis based on performing a dynamic  adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. MHC class II has previously been  associated with the human and canine diseases. In the current study, we conducted  an MHC class II association study in eight breeds of dog with diagnoses of  hypoadrenocorticism. We demonstrated significant differences in dog leukocyte  antigen (DLA) haplotype frequencies in six of these breeds: Cocker spaniel,  Springer spaniel, Labrador, West Highland white terrier (WHWT), Bearded collie,  and Standard poodle. In the Springer spaniel, the  DLA-DRB1*015:01--DQA1*006:01--DQB1*023:01 haplotype was significantly associated  with disease risk (p = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 5.14) and showed a similar trend  in the Cocker spaniel. This haplotype is related to one associated with  hypoadrenocorticism in the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever. Similar haplotypes  shared between breeds were demonstrated, with  DLA-DRB1*001:01--DQA1*001:01--DQB1*002:01 more prevalent in both affected  Labrador (p = 0.0002, OR = 3.06) and WHWT (p = 0.01, OR = 2.11). Other haplotypes  that have not previously been associated with the disease were identified. The  inter-breed differences in DLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to  canine hypoadrenocorticism could represent divergent aetiologies. This could have  implications for clinical diagnosis and future comparative studies.  Alternatively, it may suggest that the gene of interest is closely linked to the  MHC.","2013-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","291-297","","4","65","","Immunogenetics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23358933","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Haplotypes; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Amino Acid Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; *Genes, MHC Class II; Adrenal Insufficiency/genetics/*veterinary; HLA-DQ beta-Chains/chemistry/genetics; HLA-DRB1 Chains/chemistry/genetics; Homozygote; Sequence Alignment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Five  client-owned dogs referred for SDB. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed  including recheck appointments and routine preoperative and postoperative  questionnaires. Whole-body barometric plethysmography was used to categorize SDB.  RESULTS: All dogs presented with multiple episodes of stertorous breathing,  choking, and apnea during sleep. Severe nasal septal deviation, aberrant nasal  turbinates, and soft palate elongation and thickening were noted on computed  tomography and rhinoscopy of each dog. Whole-body barometric plethysmography  measurements during sleep (in 3 dogs) documented periods of choking, snoring, and  apnea. Treatment combined laser turbinectomy, folding flap palatoplasty,  tonsillectomy, laryngeal sacculectomy, and cuneiform process resection. All dogs  improved in terms of incidence and severity of sleep apnea within 1 week, with 4  of 5 dogs achieving complete resolution. CONCLUSION: The objective measurements  used to characterize SDB in this population of CKCS provided some evidence to  support an obstructive cause for this condition, which improved with surgical  treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing in the CKCS is a  different clinical presentation of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome.  Our finding of intranasal abnormalities in these 5 dogs with SDB provides  justification for future research into its clinical significance.","2019-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","497-504","","4","48","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30592314","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ownership; Sleep Apnea Syndromes/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is increasing evidence that other genes may have  testis-determining properties. In XX sex reversal (XXSR), testis tissue develops  in the absence of the Y chromosome. Previous polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  assays indicated that autosomal recessive XXSR in the American cocker spaniel is  Sry-negative. In this study, genomic DNA from the breeding colony of American  cocker spaniels and from privately owned purebred dogs were tested by PCR using  canine primers for the Sry HMG box and by Southern blots probed with the complete  canine Sry coding sequence. Sry was not detected by either method in genomic DNA  of affected American cocker spaniels or in the majority (20/21) of affected  privately owned purebred dogs. These results confirm that the autosomal recessive  form of XXSR in the American cocker spaniel is Sry-negative. In combination with  previous studies, this indicates that Sry-negative XXSR occurs in at least 15 dog  breeds. The canine disorder may be genetically heterogeneous, potentially with a  different mutation in each breed, and may provide several models for human  Sry-negative XXSR. A comparative approach to sex determination should be  informative in defining the genetic and cellular mechanisms that are common to  all mammals.","1999-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","266-273","","3","53","","Mol Reprod Dev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10369387","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Breeding; Female; Male; Pedigree; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; *Disorders of Sex Development; *Gene Deletion; *Nuclear Proteins; *Transcription Factors; *X Chromosome; DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics; Sex-Determining Region Y Protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most of these are an induced rather than a spontaneous,  naturally occurring myopia. This study was conducted to evaluate whether the  spontaneous myopia found in three canine breeds was axial in nature and therefore  similar to humans. METHODS: Refractive error was measured by cycloplegic  retinoscopy and ocular components by A-scan ultrasound (ocular axial dimensions)  and videophakometry (corneal and lens radii and powers) in 83 dogs of three  breeds [English Springer Spaniels (n = 33), Toy Poodles (n = 36), and Collies (n  = 14)]. Dogs with refractive errors equal to or more myopic than -0.5 diopters  spherical equivalent were considered myopic. RESULTS: Myopia was most common in  Toy Poodles (63.9%), followed by English Springer Spaniels (36.4%) and Collies  (35.7%). Axial lengths and vitreous chamber depths were not different between  myopic and non-myopic dogs (p = 0.84 and 0.63, respectively). The anterior  crystalline lens radius was steeper and the lens power was greater in myopic  compared with non-myopic dogs (p = 0.048 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous  myopia was very common in all three breeds in this sample of dogs, with Toy  Poodles being most affected. However, the cause of the myopia appeared to be  refractive, that is from a steeper, more powerful crystalline lens, rather than  from excess axial elongation. These breeds do not appear to be promising models  for human axial myopia.","2011-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","269-274","","2","88","","Optom Vis Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21169876","","","","Animals; Prevalence; Ultrasonography; Disease Models, Animal; *Animal Husbandry; Cornea/physiopathology; Dogs/*classification; Lens, Crystalline/pathology/physiopathology; Mydriatics; Myopia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology; Refraction, Ocular; Retinoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Histological  examination showed diffuse fibrosis with weak inflammatory reaction of extensive  neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical  examination revealed that the myofibroblastic cells positive for anti-α-smooth  muscle actin and anti-vimentin antibodies produced reticular and collagen fibers  and brought about the dissection of hepatic cords and diffuse disappearance of  hepatocytes. Reticular fibers invading between hepatocytes and the surrounding  small group of hepatocytes were strongly positive for anti-collagen type III and  anti-collagen type IV antibodies. The positivity to anti-fibronectin and  anti-laminin antibodies was frequently continuous on the basement membrane of the  sinusoids of the remaining hepatic cords and between the hepatocytes. Positive  findings for anti-E-cadherin antibody were not observed between the hepatocytes  showing positive findings for anti-collagen type III and anti-collagen type IV  antibodies. These results may explain the expression of fibronectin and laminin  that occurs prior to the invasion of reticular fibers between hepatocytes. The  present study further suggests that expression of an extracellular matrix mainly  containing fibronectin and laminin between the hepatocytes and proliferation of  collagen fibers and reticular fibers have a major role in the rupture of the  hepatic cords and disappearance of hepatocytes.","2013","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","597-603","","5","75","","J Vet Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 23292109","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Antibodies/immunology; Collagen/immunology; Dog Diseases/*immunology/*pathology; Extracellular Matrix/metabolism; Hepatitis, Animal/*immunology/*pathology; Hepatocytes/immunology/pathology; Histological Techniques/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Genetically characterized canine forms of platelet disorders  provide valuable large animal models for understanding similar platelet disorders  in people. Breed-specific disease associated genetic variants in only eight  different genes are known to cause intrinsic platelet disorders in dogs. However,  the causative genetic variant in many dog breeds has until now remained unknown.  Four cases of a mild to severe bleeding disorder in Cocker Spaniel dogs are  herein presented. The affected dogs showed a platelet adhesion defect  characterized by macrothrombocytopenia with variable platelet counts resembling  human Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). Furthermore, the lack of functional  GPIb-IX-V was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Whole genome sequencing of one  affected dog and visual inspection of the candidate genes identified a deletion  in the glycoprotein IX platelet (GP9) gene. The GP9 gene encodes a subunit of a  platelet surface membrane glycoprotein complex; this functions as a receptor for  von Willebrand factor, which initiates the maintenance of hemostasis after  injury. Variants in human GP9 are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, type  C. The deletion spanned 2460 bp, and included a significant part of the single  coding exon of the canine GP9 gene on dog chromosome 20. The variant results in a  frameshift and premature stop codon which is predicted to truncate almost  two-thirds of the encoded protein. PCR-based genotyping confirmed recessive  inheritance. The homozygous variant genotype seen in affected dogs did not occur  in 98 control Cocker Spaniels. Thus, it was concluded that the structural variant  identified in the GP9 gene was most likely causative for the BSS-phenotype in the  dogs examined. These findings provide the first large animal GP9 model for this  group of inherited platelet disorders and greatly facilitate the diagnosis and  identification of affected and/or normal carriers in Cocker Spaniels.","2019","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0220625","","9","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31484196  PMCID: PMC6726462","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Pedigree; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; *Genetic Association Studies/methods; *Sequence Deletion; Bernard-Soulier Syndrome/*veterinary; Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study.  ANIMALS: Six client-owned dogs. METHODS: Medical records (1995 to 1999) of 6 dogs  that had a discharging sinus in the midline of the nose removed surgically were  reviewed for signalment, physical examination, surgical and histopathologic  findings, and outcome. RESULTS: Three golden retrievers, 1 springer spaniel, 1  cocker spaniel, and 1 Brittany spaniel with a history of intermittent discharge  from a small opening in the midline on the bridge of the nose at the junction  between the nasal planum and the skin were identified. The condition was  unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, and previous surgical excision had been  unsuccessful in 3 dogs. None of the dogs had any other congenital defects, and  all dogs responded to complete surgical excision of the tract and cyst. On  histopathologic examination of excised tissue, there were adnexal structures  along a tract lined with stratified squamous epithelium, consistent with a  developmental abnormality of ectodermal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The lesions were  diagnosed as nasal dermoid sinus cysts, similar to the congenital condition  described in humans. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts are rare developmental defects  related to abnormal development of the pre-nasal space and may extend into the  cranial vault causing cerebral abscesses or recurrent meningitis. Complete  surgical excision has a good prognosis.

ANIMALS: Sixty-three ESS (2 with ARHN, 2 obligate  carriers, and 59 others), 2 mixed-breed dogs with X-linked HN, and 2 English  Cocker Spaniels (ECS) with ARHN were included. METHODS: ARHN was diagnosed based  on transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. DNA from  affected dogs was screened for the mutation known to cause ARHN in ECS.  Quantities of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA transcripts in renal cortex were  determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  (qRT-PCR) for ARHN-affected dogs and 7 other dogs. The coding regions of COL4A3  and COL4A4 were sequenced for the 2 ARHN-affected ESS and an unaffected dog. Exon  30 of COL4A4 was sequenced for all 63 ESS. RESULTS: qRT-PCR indicated a  significant reduction in transcript levels of both COL4A3 and COL4A4 mRNA in the  kidney of ARHN-affected ESS. Sequencing identified a single nucleotide  substitution in COL4A4 at base 2806 resulting in a premature stop codon. Thirteen  of 25 related dogs were identified as carriers.

METHODS: Records and radiographs from 24 cavalier King Charles  spaniels with mitral regurgitation were used. Vertebral heart scale (24 dogs),  and left atrial dimension and left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic  diameters (18 dogs) and their rate of increase were measured at intervals over  years to the onset of congestive heart failure. They were plotted against time to  onset of congestive heart failure. RESULTS: Dimensions and rates of change of all  parameters were highest at onset of congestive heart failure, the difference  between observed and chance outcome being highly significant using a two-tailed  chi-square test (P<0.001). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The left heart chambers  increase in size rapidly only in the last year before the onset of congestive  heart failure. Increasing left ventricular end systolic dimension is suggestive  of myocardial failure before the onset of congestive heart failure.

Identified risk factors include advancing age, specific breeds,  small body size, and periodontal disease. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To estimate the  prevalence and identify risk factors associated with CKD diagnosis and survival  in dogs. Purebred dogs were hypothesized to have higher CKD risk and poorer  survival characteristics than crossbred dogs. ANIMALS: A merged clinical database  of 107,214 dogs attending 89 UK veterinary practices over a 2-year period  (January 2010-December 2011). METHODS: A longitudinal study design estimated the  apparent prevalence (AP) whereas the true prevalence (TP) was estimated using  Bayesian analysis. A nested case-control study design evaluated risk factors.  Survival analysis used the Kaplan-Meier survival curve method and multivariable  Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: The CKD AP was 0.21% (95%  CI: 0.19-0.24%) and TP was 0.37% (95% posterior credibility interval 0.02-1.44%).  Significant risk factors included increasing age, being insured, and certain  breeds (Cocker Spaniel, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel). Cardiac disease was a  significant comorbid disorder. Significant clinical signs included halitosis,  weight loss, polyuria/polydipsia, urinary incontinence, vomiting, decreased  appetite, lethargy, and diarrhea. The median survival time from diagnosis was 226  days (95% CI 112-326 days). International Renal Interest Society stage and blood  urea nitrogen concentration at diagnosis were significantly associated with  hazard of death due to CKD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Chronic kidney  disease compromises dog welfare. Increased awareness of CKD risk factors and  association of blood biochemistry results with survival time should facilitate  diagnosis and optimize case management to improve animal survival and welfare.","2013-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","814-821","","4","27","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23647231","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; United Kingdom/epidemiology; Longitudinal Studies; Survival Analysis; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality; Epidemiology; Primary practice; Prognostic indicator; Purebred; Renal; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/epidemiology/mortality/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Canine diabetes is likely to have a complex  pathogenesis with multiple genes contributing to overall susceptibility and/or  disease progression. An association has previously been shown between canine  diabetes and MHC class II genes, although other genes are also likely to  contribute to the genetic risk. Potential diabetes susceptibility genes include  immuno-regulatory TH1/TH2 cytokines such as IFNgamma, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-10. We  screened these candidate genes for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a  range of different dog breeds using dHPLC analysis and DNA sequencing.  Thirty-eight of the SNPs were genotyped in crossbreed dogs and seven other breed  groups (Labrador Retriever, West Highland White Terrier, Collie, Schnauzer, Cairn  Terrier, Samoyed and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), which demonstrated  substantial intra-breed differences in allele frequencies. When SNPs were  examined for an association with diabetes by case:control analysis significant  associations were observed for IL-4 in three breeds, the Collie, Cairn Terrier  and Schnauzer and for IL-10 in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. These results  suggest that canine cytokine genes regulating the TH1/TH2 immune balance might  play a contributory role in determining susceptibility to diabetes in some  breeds.","2009-03-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","137-146","","1-3","128","","Vet Immunol Immunopathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19026451","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Case-Control Studies; Genotype; Gene Frequency; *Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Cytokines/*genetics/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus/genetics/*veterinary; T-Lymphocytes/*immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS STUDIED: Primary corneal endothelial  degeneration was diagnosed in 238 dogs between 1998 and 2017. Corneal ulceration  associated with PCED was present in 89 dogs (109 eyes), of which 47 eyes were  treated with SK. PROCEDURES: A retrospective assessment of medical records was  performed to determine the signalment patterns of PCED, and the success rate of  the SK procedure for resolving PCED-associated corneal ulceration. Descriptive  statistics were reported on the signalment of PCED cases, with odd ratios and  confidence intervals calculated to detect breed predispositions. RESULTS: Primary  corneal endothelial degeneration was diagnosed in 238 dogs, 40.8% were female and  59.2% were male, with a mean age at diagnosis of 11.4 years. Dachshunds,  Dalmatians, English Springer Spaniels, Welsh Springer Spaniels, Chihuahuas,  Cocker Spaniels, and Golden Retrievers were significantly over-represented. All  PCED-affected Dalmatians developed associated corneal ulceration. Follow-up  information was available for 41/47 eyes treated with SK. At the first  reassessment, 87.8% were healed which increased to 97.6% with subsequent  monitoring. Four eyes (9.8%) had late corneal ulcer occurrence following SK, at a  median time following SK of 182 weeks post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Superficial  keratectomy was an effective option for resolving painful non-healing corneal  ulcers associated with PCED.

A  total of 551 cases of CH were identified, consisting of 61 breeds. Nineteen  breeds were represented by five or more cases. Breeds with an increased risk for  developing CH included the American cocker spaniel, Cairn terrier, Dalmatian,  Dobermann pinscher, English cocker spaniel, English springer spaniel, Great Dane,  Labrador retriever and Samoyed. The median age at diagnosis for all breeds with  CH was 8 years (range 7 months to 16 years). Dalmatians, Dobermann pinschers and  English springer spaniels with CH were significantly younger than Cairn terriers,  English cocker spaniels and Labrador retrievers with CH.

ANIMALS STUDIED: 10 normal beagles, 10 beagles  with inherited primary open-angle glaucoma, 4 cocker spaniels with spontaneous  glaucoma. PROCEDURES: Formalin-preserved globes were sectioned tangentially and  sagittally and treated with H&E, Masson's trichrome, or elastin stains or  analyzed by immunohistochemistry to visualize smooth muscle actin. Tissues  associated with the US pathway were observed and compared using light microscopy.  RESULTS: Tangentially oriented sections clearly revealed spaces for the transport  of aqueous humor at the junction of the posterior iridocorneal angle (ICA) and  anterior ciliary body musculature (CBM). Within the external anterior-most of the  US pathway, the supraciliary space, distinct connective tissue cords and smooth  muscle pegs fastened the ciliary body to the adjacent sclera. Compared to normal  controls, glaucomatous eyes developed a robust scleral elastic sheath at the  junction between the posterior ICA and the anterior CBM. In advanced glaucomatous  beagles and cocker spaniels, a large amount of melanophores were seen in the US  pathway and surrounding vasculature. Within the C8M of glaucomatous specimens,  the smooth muscle bundles appeared fewer and separated by elastic-rich ECM.  Structures of the US pathway changed little with age. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior  portion of the canine US pathway is well defined and appears to be altered little  with age. However with glaucoma, changes of the US pathway were associated with  its the elastic components, as well as the accumulation of melanophores.  Collectively, these changes may have an effect on US outflow and, subsequently,  aqueous humor dynamics.","2012-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","47-53","","","15 Suppl 1","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22050998","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Anterior Chamber/*pathology; Glaucoma, Open-Angle/pathology/*veterinary; Sclera/blood supply/*pathology; Uvea/blood supply/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study.  ANIMALS: A total of 12 client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (age, 1.1-7.4  years, bodyweight, 8.2-10.8 kg) with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed SM and  clinical signs of CNeP. METHODS: Dogs were randomized to either PGN 150 mg or  placebo for 25 days, followed by 48 hour washout period before crossover to the  alternate phase of 25 days. The primary outcome was defined as number of  scratching events during 10 minutes of video-recorded physical activity.  Treatment effect was estimated using a generalized estimation equation model.  Benefit-risk and quality of life assessments were obtained through owner  interviews focusing on potential adverse events. RESULTS: The treatment effect  estimate was an 84% (95% confidence interval = 75-89%) reduction in mean number  of scratching events relative to baseline compared with placebo (p < 0.0001).  Owner-assessed satisfactory quality of life was status quo and rated as 'good' or  'could not be better' in six/11 dogs and improved in four/11 dogs. The most  prevalent adverse events were increased appetite in nine/12 dogs and transient  ataxia in nine/12 dogs. There was one dog withdrawn by the owner 7 days after  crossover to PGN owing to persistent ataxia. No dogs needed rescue analgesia  during the trial. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PGN is superior to placebo  in the reduction of clinical signs of SM-related CNeP in dogs. At a dose range of  13-19 mg kg(-1) orally twice daily, the encountered adverse events were  acceptable to all but one owner.","2020-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","238-248","","2","47","","Vet Anaesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.

METHODS: Electronic patient  records of dogs (n=134,329) attending 152 veterinary clinics during 2017 were  sourced through VetCompass Australia. They included 418 dogs with DM; a  prevalence of 0.36 per cent (95 per cent CI 0.33 per cent to 0.39 per cent) in  Australian dogs attending these veterinary clinics. By comparing with the  reference group of rarer breeds and unidentified crossbreeds, multivariable  modelling was used to reveal breeds (and their crosses) with significantly higher  odds of having DM. RESULTS: The results revealed that breeds (and their crosses)  with significantly higher odds of having DM were Australian terriers (ORs=7.93  (95 per cent CI 2.83 to 22.27)), Siberian huskies (OR=6.24 (95 per cent CI 2.51  to 15.54)), English springer spaniels (OR=5.37 (95 per cent CI 1.48 to 19.53)),  West Highland white terriers (OR=4.85 (95 per cent CI 2.55 to 9.25)), miniature  schnauzers (OR=3.47 (95 per cent CI 1.16 to 10.35)), all types of poodles  (OR=3.41 (95 per cent CI 2.07 to 5.61)), bichon frises (OR=3.41 (95 per cent CI  1.65 to 7.01)), schnauzers (OR=3.18 (95 per cent CI 1.42 to 7.11)) and cavalier  King Charles spaniels (CKCS; OR=1.84 (95 per cent CI 1.08 to 3.13)). Breeds with  lower risk were German shepherd dogs (OR=0.11 (95 per cent CI 0.01 to 0.84)),  golden retrievers (OR=0.09 (95 per cent CI 0.01 to 0.68)) and boxers (no cases  identified). Fisher's exact tests showed that labradoodles were diagnosed  significantly more often than purebred Labradors (P=0.04) and did not differ  significantly from poodles (P=0.81). Cavoodles did not differ significantly from  either CKCS (p~1.00) or poodles (P=0.12). Spoodles were significantly less  diagnosed than poodles (P=0.003) but did not differ from cocker spaniels  (P=0.66). Desexed male dogs had a higher odds of DM than entire male (OR=0.62 (95  per cent CI 0.39 to 0.98)) and desexed female dogs (OR=0.76 (95 per cent CI 0.61  to 0.96)). Comorbidities/sequelae associated with canine DM included suspected  pancreatitis (OR 10.58 (95 per cent CI 5.17 to 22.78)), cataracts (OR 9.80 (95  per cent CI 5.65 to 17.35)), hyperadrenocorticism (OR 6.21 (95 per cent CI 3.29  to 11.88)), urinary tract infection (OR 5.09 (95 per cent CI 1.97 to 13.41)) and  hypothyroidism (OR 4.10 (95 per cent CI 1.08 to 15.58)). CONCLUSIONS: Breeds at  most risk included Australian terriers and Siberian huskies as previously  reported, as well as, for the first time, English springer spaniels. In contrast  to other populations where there is female predisposition for DM, desexed male  dogs in Australia were at increased risk for DM compared with both entire males  and desexed females. This predisposition for desexed males to develop DM warrants  further investigation.","2020-08-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e22","","3","187","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","© British Veterinary Association 2020.

ANIMALS: A total of 8,860 CKCSs were examined at shows or private clinics  from 1991 to 2010. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effects of a breed scheme for CKCS  on the age at which a murmur consistent with DMVD was first detected. METHODS:  The presence or absence of a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation was  noted and age a murmur was first detected recorded. RESULTS: A total of 16,887  examinations were performed on 8,860 dogs. The median age dogs developed a murmur  were slightly younger in male than female dogs (7.8 versus 8.3 years, 95%  confidence interval [CI] 7.4-8.1 versus 8.0-8.4, P < .001) and cardiologists  detected murmurs in younger dogs than did general practitioner (GP) veterinary  surgeons (7.2 versus 8.6 years, 95% CI 7.0-7.4 versus 8.3-8.7 P < .001). In  bitches examined by GP vets during the study, there was a significantly increased  age of detection of murmurs over time (8.6-9.2 years, 95% CI 8.3-9.1 and  8.5-10.9, P = .001) but not for male dogs examined by GP vets or dogs of either  sex examined by cardiologists. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study  suggests that the age incidence of murmurs associated with DMVD might be  increased by application of breeding guidelines based on auscultation alone. This  benefit was only seen in a subgroup and compliance of breeders with this  voluntary scheme was poor.","2017-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","9-14","","1","31","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Outcome is strongly determined by molecular subtype, reflecting a need for new  and improved treatment options. Dogs spontaneously develop lymphoma, and the  predisposition of certain breeds indicates genetic risk factors. Using the dog  breed structure, we selected three lymphoma predisposed breeds developing  primarily T-cell (boxer), primarily B-cell (cocker spaniel), and with equal  distribution of B- and T-cell lymphoma (golden retriever), respectively. We  investigated the somatic mutations in B- and T-cell lymphomas from these breeds  by exome sequencing of tumor and normal pairs. Strong similarities were evident  between B-cell lymphomas from golden retrievers and cocker spaniels, with  recurrent mutations in TRAF3-MAP3K14 (28% of all cases), FBXW7 (25%), and POT1  (17%). The FBXW7 mutations recurrently occur in a specific codon; the  corresponding codon is recurrently mutated in human cancer. In contrast, T-cell  lymphomas from the predisposed breeds, boxers and golden retrievers, show little  overlap in their mutation pattern, sharing only one of their 15 most recurrently  mutated genes. Boxers, which develop aggressive T-cell lymphomas, are typically  mutated in the PTEN-mTOR pathway. T-cell lymphomas in golden retrievers are often  less aggressive, and their tumors typically showed mutations in genes involved in  cellular metabolism. We identify genes with known involvement in human lymphoma  and leukemia, genes implicated in other human cancers, as well as novel genes  that could allow new therapeutic options.","2015-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1634-1645","","11","25","","Genome Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 Elvers et al.

PROCEDURES: A retrospective record review  identified three dogs with circular retinal plaques that underwent SLO and OCT;  in two of the three dogs, FA was also completed. Morphologic changes, lesion  measurements, and angiogram characteristics were documented. An English springer  spaniel with bilateral retinal dysplasia that had undergone SLO, OCT, and FA was  used for comparison. RESULTS: Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of the retriever dogs  revealed circular retinal plaques with a dark periphery located in the tapetal  retina. OCT revealed a thickening of the nerve fiber layer corresponding to the  circular pattern observed on SLO. Within the circular plaque, the retina was  predominantly of normal architecture. FA revealed variable hypofluorescence of  both the rim and the center of the circular lesion throughout the early angiogram  phases. In the late recirculation phase, small multifocal areas of  hyperfluorescence were observed. OCT of geographic retinal dysplasia in the  English springer spaniel revealed disorganization of both inner and outer retinal  layers, and retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS: Circular plaques observed in the  tapetal retina are predominantly formed by a thickening of inner retina, while  retinal dysplasia has disorganization of both inner and outer retinal layers.  Further etiologic research is needed, including pedigree mapping to determine  whether retinal plaques are an acquired or inherited condition.","2020-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","957-963","","6","23","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32990375","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Male; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging; circinate; Fluorescein Angiography/veterinary; geographic retinal dysplasia; labrador retriever; OCT; Ophthalmoscopy/veterinary; optical coherence tomography; Retinal Detachment/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; Retinal Dysplasia/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; SLO; Tomography, Optical Coherence/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  aim of the study was to evaluate whether the duration of the R-R interval  immediately influences the degree of MR assessed by echocardiography in dogs.  Clinical examination including echocardiography was performed in 103  privately-owned dogs: 16 control Beagles, 70 CKCSs with different degree of MR  and 17 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of congestive heart failure  due to MMVD. The severity of MR was evaluated in apical four-chamber view using  colour Doppler flow mapping (maximum % of the left atrium area) and colour  Doppler M-mode (duration in ms). The influence of the ratio between present and  preceding R-R interval on MR severity was evaluated in 10 consecutive R-R  intervals using a linear mixed model for repeated measurements. MR severity was  increased when a short R-R interval was followed by a long R-R interval in CKCSs  with different degrees of MR (P<0.005 when adjusted for multiple testing). The  relationship was not significant in control dogs with minimal MR and in dogs with  severe MR and clinical signs of heart failure. In conclusion, MR severity  increases in long R-R intervals when these follow a short R-R interval in CKCSs  with different degrees of MR due to asymptomatic MMVD. Thus, R-R interval  variations may affect the echocardiographic grading of MR in CKCSs.","2014-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","348-354","","3","199","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With a view to discovering new non-host semiochemicals as tick  repellents, we compared the semiochemicals produced by a putative tick-resistant  breed of dog, miniature pinscher, with known tick-resistant (beagle) and  tick-susceptible (English cocker spaniel) breeds. Two non-host compounds produced  by beagles, i.e. 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde, were shown to be present in samples  collected from all three breeds. Furthermore, two compounds,  6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, were found in higher amounts  in samples collected from miniature pinscher dogs. The mean amounts of  benzaldehyde, 2-hexanone and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were similar for beagles and  miniature pinschers (P > 0.05) and higher than the means observed for cocker  spaniels (P < 0.05), whereas the mean amount of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one produced  by miniature pinschers was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for the other  breeds of dogs. In Petri-dish assays with adult R. sanguineus s.l.,  6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was repellent for all observation periods evaluated for  the two highest concentrations (0.100 and 0.200 mg.cm(-2), P < 0.01). The  obtained results support our hypothesis that miniature pinschers are a  tick-resistant dog breed and agree with previous observations of miniature  pinschers being the breed least parasitized by ticks. Furthermore, the non-host  semiochemical 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one has potential to be developed for use as a  repellent for the protection of susceptible dogs from R. sanguineus s.l. ticks.","2021-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","101582","","1","12","","Ticks Tick Borne Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier GmbH.

AE is caused by  the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis in intermediate and also in  accidental hosts. The principal definitive host is the red fox, but domestic dogs  and cats are also potential definitive hosts. Several species of rodents serve as  intermediate hosts of this parasite. However, there are also some species acting  as accidental intermediate hosts, among them dogs. Since the late 1980s cases of  canine AE have been diagnosed. Here, we present a case of canine AE in a two-year  old female intact German spaniel from Thuringia, Central Germany. The dog was  used as a hunting dog and presented to a small animal clinic for subacute  lethargy and inappetence. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast computed tomography  (CT) scan were performed and revealed intrahepatic lesions. Multinodular changes  of the liver and the greater omentum were demonstrated by exploratory laparotomy.  After euthanasia, a necropsy was performed and histological sections of  representative tissue samples were prepared. PCR followed by sequencing was  conducted with DNA extracted from tissue samples of the liver, hepatic lymph  nodes and greater omentum. The sequence herein obtained showed very high  similarity with other partial nad2 sequences of E. multilocularis from the  GenBank database by BLASTn analysis and was analysed using the maximum likelihood  method.

Sagittal magnetic resonance  (MR) images have been described as the preferred technique for visualizing SM in  dogs and humans. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether computed tomography (CT) can  be used to diagnose SM. ANIMALS: Thirty-two client-owned dogs referred for  investigation of the cervical spine on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT.  METHODS: Two reviewers retrospectively analyzed sagittal and transverse  T1-weighted spin echo (T1WSE) MR images and CT images from each dog for the  presence of SM and, if SM was present, the width (mm, syrinx width [SW]) was  measured. The results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: For the presence of  SM there was a moderate interobserver agreement for MR (81%, κ = 0.54) and almost  perfect agreement for CT (94%, κ = 0.87). There was a moderate intramodality  agreement for both observers (observer 1 81%, κ = 0.59; observer 2 81%,  κ = 0.57). For measurement of SW the repeatability was the best on the  midsagittal T1WSE images (95% repeatability coefficient <0.52 mm) and the  reproducibility was the best on midsagittal images in both modalities (95% limits  of agreement -0.55-0.45; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Both  techniques can be used to detect SM. Midsagittal MR and CT images are best used  for measuring SW. Computed tomography can be used as a diagnostic tool for SM  when MRI is not available, but CT cannot replace MRI as the standard screening  technique for the detection of SM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel for breeding  purposes.","2015-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1354-1359","","5","29","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

These closed genetic populations have metabolic and physiological  characteristics that may be revealed by metabolomic analysis. OBJECTIVES: To  identify and characterise the drivers of metabolic differences in the fasted  plasma metabolome and then determine metabolites differentiating breeds. METHODS:  Fasted plasma samples were collected from dogs maintained under two environmental  conditions (controlled and client-owned at home). The former (n = 33) consisted  of three breeds (Labrador Retriever, Cocker Spaniel and Miniature Schnauzer) fed  a single diet batch, the latter (n = 96), client-owned dogs consisted of 9 breeds  (Beagle, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, Dachshund, Golden Retriever, Greyhound,  German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Maltese) consuming various diets under  differing feeding regimens. Triplicate samples were taken from Beagle (n = 10)  and Labrador Retriever (n = 9) over 3 months. Non-targeted metabolite  fingerprinting was performed using flow infusion electrospray-ionization mass  spectrometry which was coupled with multivariate data analysis. Metadata factors  including age, gender, sexual status, weight, diet and breed were investigated.  RESULTS: Breed differences were identified in the plasma metabolome of dogs  housed in a controlled environment. Triplicate samples from two breeds identified  intra-individual variability, yet breed separation was still observed. The main  drivers of variance in dogs maintained in the home environment were associated  with breed and gender. Furthermore, metabolite signals were identified that  discriminated between Labrador Retriever and Cocker Spaniels in both  environments. CONCLUSION: Metabolite fingerprinting of plasma samples can be used  to investigate breed differences in client-owned dogs, despite added variance of  diet, sexual status and environment.","2016","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","72","","","12","","Metabolomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27065761  PMCID: PMC4783439","","","","Inter-breed variability; Intra-breed variability; Metabolite fingerprinting; Metabolomics; Multivariate data analysis; Plasma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: From magnetic resonance imaging scans of 78 cavalier  King Charles spaniels, measurements were made of the widest vertical spinal width  at C1/C2, C2, C2/C3 and C3; angulation of the C2/C3 spine; and estimated caudal  fossa area. A correlation between these measurements and syringomyelia was  sought. RESULTS: A total of 59 dogs with and 19 without syringomyelia were  compared. Older dogs had a significantly higher incidence of syringomyelia. No  difference in incidence was noted between genders. There was no significant  difference in vertebral canal width at C1/C2 and C2, or angulation of C2/C3  between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups.

CLINICAL  SIGNIFICANCE: Although syringomyelia was shown to be more prevalent in older  dogs, the age beyond which dogs were considered at greater risk was not deducible  from the dataset. The association identified between wider spinal canal at C3,  and C2/C3 and syringomyelia presence is of questionable clinical significance, as  the difference between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups is too small to  be measured in a clinical setting.","2009-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","394-398","","8","50","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19689666","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Skull/*pathology; Syringomyelia/pathology/*veterinary; Cranial Fossa, Posterior/pathology; Cervical Vertebrae/*pathology; Spinal Canal/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  these breeds, SM is typically secondary to Chiari-like Malformation (CM). There  has been much debate in the scientific and veterinary communities to what extent  head shape is indicative of either pathology, especially as certain  craniosynostosis syndromes in humans (highly associated with CM) have  characteristic facial and cranial morphologies. Elucidating a risk morphology  would allow for selection away from these traits and proffer further breeding  guidelines for the condition. Dogs were measured in multiple countries by means  of a standardised bony landmark measuring protocol and photo analysis by blinded,  trained researchers. RESULTS: The results found two significant risk factors in  the conformation of the CKCS: extent of brachycephaly and distribution of  cranium. The study identified a greater amount of cranium distributed caudally  (relative to the amount distributed rostrally) to be significantly protective  against syrinx development at the levels of three years of age, five years of age  and when comparing a sample of SM clear individuals over the age of five to those  affected younger than three years of age. A decreased cephalic index (decreasing  brachycephaly) was significantly protective at the latter level. Cephalic index  and caudal cranium distribution exhibited a negative, linear relationship.  Cephalic index demonstrated a positive linear relationship with the amount of  doming of the head. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a risk phenotype of  brachycephaly with resulting rostrocaudal doming that is more rostrally  distributed and hence sloping caudally. The results of this study may allow for  selection against risk aspects of conformation in the CKCS in combination with  the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club CM/SM scheme to enable reduction  in CM/SM incidence. Further research comparing this external risk phenotype to  the internal presentation upon MRI would determine how these features are  indicative of syrinx development. Utilising breeds in which CM free individuals  are more available may allow for validation of this risk phenotype for CM or  determine alternatives.","2014","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","9","","","1","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26401326  PMCID: PMC4579371","","","","Chiari-like malformation; Syringomyelia; Cavalier King Charles spaniel; Chiari malformation; Canine skull morphology; Conformation; Occipital hypoplasia; Pedigree dog health; Toy breed dogs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study  aimed to investigate for the first time the prevalence, breed-based risk factors  and clinical management of CUD in the general population of dogs under primary  veterinary care in England. RESULTS: Of 104,233 dogs attending 110 clinics  participating within the VetCompass Programme from January 1(st) to December  31(st) 2013, there were 834 confirmed CUD cases (prevalence: 0.80%, 95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.75-0.86). Breeds with the highest prevalence included  Pug (5.42% of the breed affected), Boxer (4.98%), Shih Tzu (3.45%), Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel (2.49%) and Bulldog (2.41%). Purebred dogs had 2.23 times the  odds (95% CI 1.84-2.87, P < 0.001) of CUD compared with crossbreds.  Brachycephalic types had 11.18 (95% CI 8.72-14.32, P < 0.001) and spaniel types  had 3.13 (95% CI 2.38-4.12, P < 0.001) times the odds for CUD compared with  crossbreds. Pain was recorded in 385 (46.2%) cases and analgesia was used in 455  (54.6%) of dogs. Overall, 62 (7.4%) cases were referred for advanced management  and CUD contributed to the euthanasia decision for 10 dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Breeds  such as the Pug and Boxer, and conformational types such as brachycephalic and  spaniels, demonstrated predisposition to CUD in the general canine population.  These results suggest that breeding focus on periocular conformation in  predisposed breeds should be considered in order to reduce corneal disease.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","5","","","4","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28630713  PMCID: PMC5471714","","","","VetCompass; Brachycephalic; Corneal ulceration; First opinion; General practice; Spaniel; Ulcerative keratitis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All three dogs exhibited tissue proliferation of  both ear canals that did not respond to glucocorticoids. Treatment consisted of  total ear canal ablation, and tissues were submitted for histopathological  evaluation. Case # 1 (a 10-year-old, male cocker spaniel) was diagnosed as  ceruminious gland carcinoma. Cases # 2 and 3 were diagnosed as squamous cell  carcinoma. Case # 1 was diagnosed 4 years earlier as having keratinization  disorder, which was causing its chronic ear problems. Case # 2 (a 5-year-old,  female French bulldog) was diagnosed 4 years earlier as having atopic dermatitis,  which did not respond to hyposensitization, and only partially responded to  glucocorticoids therapy. Case # 3 (a 9-year-old, male German shepherd) was  diagnosed by the referring veterinarian as having unilateral ear canal  proliferation 2 months prior to presentation. However, otoscopic examination  showed bilateral proliferation that obstructed both canals. In summary, bilateral  ear canal neoplasia should be considered in cases of nonresponsive, proliferative  aural pathology.","2005-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","276-280","","4","16","","Vet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16101799","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Diagnosis, Differential; Radiography; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis/*veterinary; Ear Neoplasms/diagnosis/*veterinary; Ear, External/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reduced periventricular blood flow was found in people with high elevated  intraventricular pressure. The aim of this study was to compare periventricular  brain perfusion in dogs with and without ventriculomegaly using perfusion  weighted-magnetic-resonance-imaging to clarify as to whether ventriculomegaly  might be associated with an increase in intraventricular pressure. Perfusion was  measured in 32 Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) with ventriculomegaly, 10  CKCSs were examined as a control group. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured  using free-hand regions of interest (ROI) in five brain regions: periventricular  white matter, caudate nucleus, parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. CBF  was significantly lower in the periventricular white matter of the dogs with  ventriculomegaly (p = 0.0029) but not in the other ROIs. Reduction of  periventricular CBF might imply increase of intraventricular pressure in  ventriculomegaly.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","137","","","4","","Front Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 28879204  PMCID: PMC5572229","","","","brachycephaly; Cavalier King Charles spaniels; magnetic resonance imaging cerebral blood flow; malformation; normal pressure hydrocephalus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: DNA samples from 21  cases/parents were collected. Canine candidate genes (CCGs) for similar inherited  human diseases were chosen. Twenty-eight candidate genes were identified by  searching the Pubmed OMIM database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim). Canine  orthologues of human candidate genes were identified using the Ensembl orthologue  prediction facility (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Two microsatellites  flanking each candidate gene were selected, and primers to amplify each  microsatellite were designed using the Whitehead Institute primer design website  (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). The microsatellites associated with all 28  CCGs were genotyped on a panel of 21 DNA samples from CKCS dogs (13 affected and  eight carriers). Genotyping data was analyzed to identify markers homozygous in  affected dogs and heterozygous in carriers (homozygosity mapping). RESULTS: None  of the microsatellites associated with 25 of the CCGs displayed an association  with CKCSID in the 21 DNA samples tested. Three CCGs associated microsatellites  were monomorphic across all samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five CCGs were  excluded as cause of CKCSID. Three CCGs could not be excluded from involvement in  the inheritance of CKCSID.","2012-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","327-332","","5","15","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22339941","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genotype; Dog Diseases/*genetics/pathology; Aging; DNA; Ichthyosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca/congenital/pathology/*veterinary; Microsatellite Repeats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent molecular studies in the English Springer Spaniel (ESS) dog have  shown that PRA cases are often homozygous for a mutation in the RPGRIP1 gene, the  defect also causing human RP, LCA, and cone rod dystrophies. The present study  characterizes the disease in a group of affected ESS in USA, using clinical,  functional, and morphological studies. An objective evaluation of retinal  function using electroretinography (ERG) is further performed in a masked fashion  in a group of American ESS dogs, with the examiner masked to the genetic status  of the dogs.

ANIMALS: Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n = 6) and  age-matched mixed breed (n = 6) with severe myxomatous mitral valve disease  (MMVD), and normal mixed breed (n = 4) dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Immunohistochemistry staining and qualitative and quantitative analysis of mitral  valves sections, examining for the presence of CD11c and CD45, vimentin, alpha  smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and embryonic smooth muscle myosin heavy chain  (Smemb), von Willebrand factor and CD31 and Ki-67. RESULTS: Vimentin positive  cell numbers were increased in the MMVD dogs and distributed throughout the valve  with greatest density close to the endothelium. There were no significant  differences in cell marker expression for the two diseased groups, but cell  numbers were significantly increased compared to controls for α-SMA (CKCS only)  and Smemb (CKCS and mixed breed: p < 0.05). Alpha smooth muscle actin+ cells were  primarily located at the valve edge, with Smemb+ cells similarly located, but  also present throughout the valve stroma. A small number of cells close to the  valve edge co-expressed α-SMA and Smemb. Endothelial von Willebrand factor  expression was identified in all valves, with evidence of disrupted endothelium  in the diseased, but was also found in diseased valve stroma. There was no  staining for CD11c, CD45 or CD31 in any valve. Ki-67+ cells formed linear  clusters at the leaflet tip and were sparsely distributed throughout both  myxomatous valve groups. CONCLUSIONS: The cellular changes notes with advanced  stage MMVD appear similar for CKCS when compared to mixed breed dogs.","2016-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","100-109","","2","18","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The study  population included all dogs that had visited one of 16 veterinary practices  located in Scotland between 2002 and early 2012. The overall prevalence of tail  injuries in dogs visiting one of the 16 veterinary practices was 0.59 per cent.  The prevalence of tail injuries in dogs of working breeds was estimated to be  0.90 per cent. Working dog breeds that were examined by a veterinary surgeon were  at a significantly greater risk of sustaining a tail injury than non-working  breeds (P<0.001). To prevent one such tail injury in these working breeds  approximately 232 dogs would need to be docked as puppies. To prevent one tail  amputation in spaniels, 320 spaniel puppies would need to be docked. Spaniels  presented after January 2009 were 2.3 times more likely to have a tail injury  than those presented before April 29, 2007 (date of the legislation that banned  tail docking in Scotland).

Current diagnostic criteria for this condition are subjective and  clinician-dependent; objective criteria are needed to allow a reliable and  reproducible diagnosis in clinical and research settings and assess clinical  significance. We propose four standardized MRI-based measurements to objectively  assess the proximity of the atlas to the foramen magnum. Inclusion criteria for  dogs in this study were bodyweight <15 kg, age >5 months, and availability of a  complete MRI study performed with the craniocervical junction in extension.  Exclusion criteria were space-occupying lesions and poor image quality (i.e.  unclear bony margins). Measurements also included blinded determinations of skull  type, presence of craniocervical junction anomalies and presence and severity of  syringomyelia. Clinical status at the time of imaging was noted. Measurements  were obtained in 271 dogs; these were reproducible and reliable. Findings varied  by skull type: dolichocephalic dogs had smaller foramen magnum, whereas  brachycephalic dogs had more cranially and dorsally positioned atlas bodies in  comparison to the other skull types. Measurements also increased with increases  in bodyweight. This study demonstrated a close association between AOO,  syringomyelia and clinical signs. Toy and small breed dogs (including Cavalier  King Charles spaniels) showed higher than previously reported prevalence of AOO;  its occurrence was also associated with lower bodyweights within the study  population of <15 kg toy/small breed dogs.","2016-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","133-138","","","209","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Left-sided intraforaminal compression of the first  caudal nerve root due to intervertebral disc disease was diagnosed by  radiographic, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging examinations.  The dog was nonresponsive to conservative medical therapy. A decompressive  left-sided first-second caudal (Cd1-Cd2) foraminotomy was performed.  Postoperative computed tomography confirmed surgical decompression of the  involved nerve root. At the one month follow-up examination there was marked  improvement in clinical signs. At two months, clinical signs were completely  resolved and there was not any evidence of recurrence twelve months after  surgery. Intervertebral disc disease should be considered as a differential  diagnosis in dogs with discomfort at the tail base or signs of pain on  manipulation of the tail. Surgical decompression may be indicated for management  of these cases.

RESULTS: There were 44 breeds  in the study, with four breeds, English cocker spaniels, cavalier King Charles  spaniels, West Highland white terriers and shih-tzus, making up 58 per cent of  the cases. Among these four breeds, two breed-dependent disease patterns, one  chronic and one acute, were identified. English cocker spaniels and West Highland  white terriers had a mean age at onset of clinical signs of five years and one  month and five years and six months, respectively, with more females affected  than males. Clinical signs consisted predominantly of conjunctival hyperaemia and  mucopurulent discharge, with a relatively low incidence of ulcerative keratitis.  In contrast, cavalier King Charles spaniels and shih-tzus showed a more acute  disease pattern with a biphasic age distribution at 0 to less than two years of  age, and four to less than six and six to less than eight years of age,  respectively, with more males affected than females and a significantly higher  incidence of ulcerative keratitis in some cases resulting in corneal perforation.  CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study reveals interbreed differences with respect to  sex, age and risk of ulcerative keratitis which have not been detailed previously  in a referral population.","2007-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","211-217","","4","48","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17381766","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Risk Factors; Pedigree; Sex Factors; Age Factors; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/pathology; Corneal Ulcer/epidemiology/etiology/veterinary; Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beagles are less  susceptible to tick infestations than English cocker spaniels due to enhanced  production of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde that act as volatile tick repellents.  We report the use of prototype slow-release formulations of these compounds to  reduce the burden of R. sanguineus s. l. on English cocker spaniel dogs. Twelve  dogs were randomly assigned to two groups with six dogs each. The treated group  received collars with slow-release formulations of the compounds attached, while  the control group received collars with clean formulations attached. Five  environmental infestations were performed, with the number of ticks (at all  stages) on the dogs being counted twice a day for 45days. The counts on the  number of tick stages found per dog were individually fitted to linear mixed  effects models with repeated measures and normal distribution for errors. The  mean tick infestation in the treated group was significantly lower than in the  control group. For larvae and nymphs, a decrease in tick infestation was observed  at the fifth count, and for adults, lower average counts were observed in all  counts. The compounds did not interfere with the distribution of the ticks on the  body of the dogs, as a similar percentage of ticks was found on the anterior half  of the dogs (54.5% for the control group and 56.2% for the treated group). The  biological and reproductive parameters of the ticks were not affected by the  repellents. This study highlights for the first time the potential use of a novel  allomone (repellent)-based formulation for reduction of tick infestation on  susceptible dogs.","2017-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","139-145","","1","8","","Ticks Tick Borne Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

In human patients with liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is  a common complication. However, PVT has not been reported in dogs with LDH.  Herein, we describe the long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel  with LDH. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered male American Cocker Spaniel  presented with a 1-month history of severe abdominal effusion. The dog was  histopathologically diagnosed with LDH and treated with low-dose prednisolone on  day 14. On day 115, computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence  of a thrombus in the portal vein. Therefore, the dog was subcutaneously  administered with the anticoagulant dalteparin, and low-dose prednisolone was  continued. As a follow-up for PVT, CTA examinations were performed on days 207,  515, 886, and 1168, and the dog's antithrombin and D-dimer levels were measured.  Following anticoagulant therapy, the dog was confirmed to have gradually  increased antithrombin activity and decreased D-dimer concentrations. In  addition, although the thrombus was confirmed to be in the same area of the  portal vein system by CTA, atrophy and increased CT values due to organization  were observed during the follow-up period. The dog's condition remained stable  without clinical signs until day 1112 when it developed hepatic encephalopathy.  The dog died on day 1208. On postmortem examination, histopathologically, the  liver showed marked bile duct hyperplasia and fibrosis with chronic thrombus in  the portal vein. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrated that low-dose glucocorticoid  combined with dalteparin allowed long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker  Spaniel with LDH.","2021-09-30","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","319","","1","17","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

The aim was to retrospectively investigate SA in dogs in Sweden with  respect to breed, sex and age distribution. A second aim was to retrospectively  compare clinical signs in dogs with generalized SA and to estimate the survival  after diagnosis in the English springer spaniel, standard poodle and the akita.  METHODS: In total 34 Swedish veterinarians contributed with 104 clinically and  histologically verified SA cases. Breed, gender and age at diagnosis were  registered for each case. The degree of clinical signs at time for diagnosis and  at follow-up and information about treatments, concurrent diseases and euthanasia  were recorded for the springer spaniels, standard poodles and akitas using a  standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 104 cases of SA were included;  most cases were recorded for the springer spaniel (n = 25), standard poodle (n =  21) and the akita (n = 10). These three breeds, together with the lhasa apso and  the chow-chow, were the most common when national registry data from the Swedish  Board of Agriculture and Swedish Kennel Club were considered. The mean age at  diagnosis was 4.8 years. The proportion of males was 61%. When the springer  spaniels, standard poodles and the akitas with generalized signs were compared (n  = 51), the spaniels showed significantly more severe clinical signs than the  poodles at diagnosis regarding alopecia, seborrhoea, pyoderma and the overall  severity of clinical signs. At follow-up, the degree of clinical signs for otitis  externa and pyoderma differed significantly between the breeds. The estimated  median survival time was 42 months. In dogs where data regarding survival was  available at the end of the study (n = 44), SA was reported to be the reason for  euthanasia in 14 dogs, whereof 7 within 24 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION:  The result of this study implicates that the English springer spaniel is a breed  predisposed to SA and that it has more severe clinical signs than the standard  poodle. A large proportion of the dogs (spaniel, poodle and akita) investigated  regarding survival were reported to have been euthanized to great extent due to  the disease.","2008-05-25","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","11","","1","50","","Acta Vet Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18501018  PMCID: PMC2412885","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Pedigree; Severity of Illness Index; Sweden/epidemiology; Survival Analysis; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality/pathology; Lymphadenitis/epidemiology/*veterinary; Records; Registries; Sebaceous Gland Diseases/epidemiology/*veterinary; Veterinary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  Nineteen cases (13 litters) were investigated, with particular reference to eye  and skin clinical signs. In addition, five generation pedigrees were obtained and  studied from all cases with the exception of one. RESULTS: The eye signs were due  to keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a common ocular disease in the dog, but rarely of  congenital origin. The skin signs were of an ichthyosiform dermatosis; ichthyosis  being a rare skin disease in the dog. In human beings, ichthyosis is a similar  disease, mainly inherited and with a neonatal onset, and sometimes accompanied by  other developmental defects. In the cavalier King Charles spaniel, the coat  abnormality was noted at birth by the breeders as a 'curly coat', with  deterioration of the skin signs as the animal became adult. CLINICAL  SIGNIFICANCE: These two conditions occurring together in this breed is well  recognised by some breeders but rarely by the veterinary profession. Successful  treatment is not possible, although some improvement, particularly of the  keratoconjunctivitis sicca, can be obtained. The probable hereditary nature of  the condition is an important factor for control.","2006-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","524-528","","9","47","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16961470","","","","Animals; Dogs; *Pedigree; Breeding; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*congenital/pathology; Ichthyosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Keratoconjunctivitis/congenital/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method of the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement  Program (PennHIP), an alternative technique that is based on hip joint laxity,  provides a quantitative assessment, the distraction index (DI), of the likelihood  of the development of CHD because of increased laxity in the hip joint. Linear  regression analysis showed that, across many breeds of dog, the incidence of CHD,  as defined by the OFA, is positively correlated with the mean DI, the  determination coefficient (r2) being 26%. We used families of Boykin spaniels  (BSs) to determine the level of joint laxity in the breed and to conduct an  initial whole-genome screening to identify markers that co-segregate with  increased joint laxity. Although there was a positive correlation between the  incidence of hip dysplasia and increased joint laxity, we did not find  significant linkage in the 28 BSs that underwent genotyping, likely owing to the  small size of the pedigree.","2006-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","148-150","","2","70","","Can J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 16639948  PMCID: PMC1410725","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Genotype; Incidence; Body Weight/physiology; *Genetic Markers; Hip Dysplasia, Canine/epidemiology/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus leading to the suggestion that beagle dogs are  be tick-resistant dogs. Behavioural studies have demonstrated that more ticks are  attracted by extracts from cocker spaniels than from beagles and that the odour  of beagles is a repellent. To test the hypothesis that resistant hosts produce  repellent compounds, we undertook comparative chemical analysis on beagle odour  and cocker spaniel extracts using coupled high-resolution gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry (GC-MS) and also used Petri-dish and olfactometer behavioural assays  to assess the response of ticks to identified non-host compounds. The beagle  odour extracts contained almost three times as many chemical compounds as cocker  spaniel samples. Several non-host compounds were identified, i.e. 2-hexanone,  benzaldehyde, nonane, decane and undecane. In Petri-dish assays, 2-hexanone was  repellent at 30 min at concentrations of 0.200 and 0.050 mg cm(-2), whilst at 10  min, the 0.100 mg cm(-2) concentration was repellent. Benzaldehyde repelled ticks  at 30 min (0.200 mg cm(-2)) and at 5 min (0.050 mg cm(-2)). Undecane was  repellent for R. sanguineus s.l. ticks for the first 5 min at the highest  concentration tested. Nonane and decane did not show any significant repellency  at any concentration or time evaluated. When 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde were  combined, an increase in the repellency rate was observed, with activity  comparable or better than N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET). In olfactometer  bioassays, a 1:1 mixture of 2-hexanone:benzaldehyde and DEET were repellent for  R. sanguineus s.l. adults at the concentration of 0.200 mg cm(-2). This study  identified non-host semiochemicals that mediate avoidance of the beagle dog breed  by R. sanguineus s.l.

The underlying pathophysiology of the development and progression  of syringes is currently unknown. The primary aim of the current study was to  determine whether development of syringomyelia is accompanied by alterations in  cerebrospinal fluid composition. Patient records of Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels with Chiari-like malformations, with or without concurrent  syringomyelia, that had magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid  analysis between December 2004 and December 2009, were retrospectively reviewed.  Total nucleated cell count per microliter, with differential count, red blood  cell count per microliter, and protein concentration (g/l), were reviewed. Data  were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Spearman rank test was used to test  association between cerebrospinal fluid composition and syrinx size, and the  Fisher exact test was used to compare the presence of macrophages, reactive  lymphocytes, and myelin.

There was a positive correlation between total nucleated cell  count and syrinx size (r  =  0.51; P  =  0.0068). Development of syringomyelia is  accompanied by alterations in cerebrospinal fluid composition. The pathogenesis  of syringomyelia has not been fully elucidated; therefore, the exact origin of  cerebrospinal fluid changes remains unclear.","2011-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","302-307","","2","23","","J Vet Diagn Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21398451","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/pathology/*veterinary; Cell Count/veterinary; Cerebrospinal Fluid/chemistry/cytology; Dog Diseases/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology; Statistics, Nonparametric; Syringomyelia/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The true hermaphrodites were partially-masculinized  females with ovotestes; the XX males had malformed male external genitalia and  cryptorchid aspermatogenic testes. Wolffian and Mullerian duct derivatives were  present in both true hermaphrodites and XX males. All four sires of sex-reversed  dogs were normal XY males; five of the dams were anatomically normal females and  one was an XX true hermaphrodite. A second true hermaphrodite reproduced as a  female, producing anatomically normal offspring. All matings that produced  sex-reversed offspring were consanguineous. Matings of the parents of  sex-reversed cocker spaniels to normal beagles with no family history of  intersexuality produced only normal offspring. Examination of G-banded karyotypes  of the affected animals, their parents, and siblings, revealed no structural  anomalies of the chromosomes that were consistently associated with sex-reversal.  In assays for serologically-detectable H-Y antigen, the group of XX true  hermaphrodites and the group of XX males had mean levels of the antigen not  significantly different from that in normal male controls. Female parents of  sex-reversed dogs and some of their female siblings were typed H-Y antigen  positive, but the mean level of the antigen in this group was less than that of  normal male controls. It is proposed that XX sex reversal in cocker spaniels is  due to a mutant gene which when homozygous in females, results in a level of H-Y  antigen similar to that found in normal males and the gonads develop as ovotestes  or testes. When the gene is heterozygous in females, the level of  serologically-detectable H-Y antigen is lower than that found in normal males and  the gonads develop as normal ovaries. The persistence of Mullerian structures in  the presence of testicular tissue suggests that Mullerian inhibiting substance is  deficient or ineffective in its action in this condition.","1984","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","62-69","","1","67","","Hum Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 6745927","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Heterozygote; Karyotyping; Testis/abnormalities; Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic; Disorders of Sex Development/genetics/immunology/pathology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/*genetics/immunology/pathology; H-Y Antigen/analysis; Ovarian Follicle/ultrastructure; Ovary/abnormalities; Seminiferous Tubules/ultrastructure; Spermatozoa/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans with Chiari type I  malformation (CM-I), abnormal pulsation of the cerebellum during the cardiac  cycle has been documented and is pivotal to theories for the pathogenesis of  syringomyelia (SM). In this retrospective study, cardiac-gated cine balanced fast  field echo (bFEE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess pulsation  of the brain in dogs and to objectively measure the degree of cerebellar  pulsation with the neck in a flexed position. Overall, 17 Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels (CKCS) with CM, including eight with SM and nine without SM, were  compared with six small breed control dogs. Linear regions of interest were  generated for the length of cerebellar herniation from each phase of the cardiac  cycle and the degree of cerebellar pulsation was subsequently calculated. Age,  bodyweight and angle of neck flexion were also compared. CKCS with CM and SM had  significantly greater pulsation of the cerebellum than control dogs (P=0.003) and  CKCS with CM only (P=0.031). There was no significant difference in age,  bodyweight and angle of neck flexion between the three groups. Cardiac-gated cine  bFEE MRI permitted the dynamic visualisation of cerebellar pulsation in dogs.  These findings support the current theories regarding the pathogenesis of SM  secondary to CM and further highlight the similarities between canine CM and  human CM-I.","2013-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","88-91","","1","198","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study investigated gundogs that  worked in the seasons 2005/2006 and 2006/2007. Information was acquired by owner  questionnaires. The dogs were classified as working in the beating line, as peg  dogs or as picking up dogs. A further group comprised Setters and Pointers that  worked the grouse moors. A secondary objective was to assess the incidence of  injuries that were treated by owners without seeking the assistance of their  veterinarian, and to identify those that may have been underestimated. Depending  on whether a dog was injured or went lame, and, if so, the nature of the injury,  was correlated with the number of days worked, where it worked, its breed and the  type of work it did. A mildly positive association between the Spaniel breed  group and injuries was seen in 2005/2006 but not in 2006/2007. However, the  relationship between the type of work and injuries was very significant for both  seasons with dogs working in the beating line being at greatest risk and Setters  and Pointers having the least number of injuries. The dogs in the beating line  were also at a significantly greater risk of injury in both years when the type  of injury was investigated. Fifty-three percent of all injuries were deemed to be  sufficiently minor, that veterinary attention was not sought. However, those dogs  with proximal thoracic limb lameness may have been under-investigated. There was  a highly significant association between tail injuries and undocked Springer and  Cocker Spaniels.","2008","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","231-237","","3","21","","Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 18536849","","","","Animals; Breeding; Female; Male; United Kingdom; Dogs/*injuries; Tail/*injuries; Lameness, Animal/epidemiology/*etiology; Sports; Wounds and Injuries/complications/epidemiology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incidence of MCTs for registered  breeds in Austria, an estimate of the risk by means of the odds ratios based on  breed as well as the anatomic localisation of MCTs were examined. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: In the first part of the study, the ranking of breeds in Austria based  on 147,802 dogs with known breed (including mixed breed) was determined, based on  those dogs included in the laboratory data base from 2000 to 2010. In the second  part of the study, 476 dogs were identified with MCTs and analysed by age, sex,  Patnaik grade of MCT and breed distribution. The odds ratios with confidence  intervals were calculated for all breeds with skin tumours. RESULTS: The age  distribution showed a peak in the age group from 6.1 to 8.0 years; 70% of MCTs  were localised to the head and trunk. No significant difference was found based  on gender. The evaluation of the odds ratios showed that only four of the 20 of  the most popular in Austria breeds (Boxer, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden  Retriever, Spaniel) had an increased risk; on the other hand, some breeds which  have not been previously identified in the literature were indicated to have a  significantly increased risk for MCT (e.g., Dogo Argentino, Tibetan Spaniel,  Pyrenean Mountain Dog, Beauceron, and Austrian Smooth-haired Hound). CONCLUSION  AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because disease risk may influence the popularity of some  currently rare breeds, consultation with breeders and owners regarding the  identification of the breeds newly identified in this study as an increased risk  for development of mast cell tumours is indicated.","2014","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","367-373","","6","42","","Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 25418504","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Odds Ratio; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/pathology; cytology; Dog breed; histopathology; mastocytoma; Mastocytoma/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary; risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority (60%) of dogs displayed 5 mmHg or less in IOP change postmydriasis.  Siberian Huskies showed the highest IOP levels, and also had the greatest  variability with dilation.

Four male dogs and one female dog  with chronic haemolysis and haemolytic crises were found to have markedly reduced  PFK activity in erythrocytes (8-20% of control English springer spaniels).  PFK-deficient erythrocytes exhibited an extreme alkaline and sucrose lysis. The  oxygen dissociation curve of erythrocyte suspensions was shifted to the left with  a 50% saturation of haemoglobin at a partial oxygen pressure of 16-17 mmHg  (normal 26-31 mmHg). Muscle wasting and mildly increased serum creatine  phosphokinase activity were also noted. Six clinically normal first degree  relatives of affected dogs had erythrocyte PFK activities that were 38-51% of  controls. In these family members, there was an erythrocytosis and mild  reticulocytosis probably due to a mildly enhanced haemoglobin-oxygen affinity but  no increase in serum creatine phosphokinase. These studies confirm the familial  nature of muscle-type PFK deficiency in English springer spaniels and support the  conclusion that this animal model of the human glycogen storage disease type VII  is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.","1986","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","15-23","","1","17","","Anim Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2940948","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Genes, Recessive; Erythrocytes/enzymology; Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology/genetics/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/enzymology/*genetics; Phosphofructokinase-1/blood/*deficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A representative study of Danish owners of  four small dog breeds.","PloS one","","1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0172091","","A number of dog breeds suffer from welfare problems due to extreme phenotypes and high levels of inherited diseases but the popularity of such breeds is not  declining. Using a survey of owners of two popular breeds with extreme physical  features (French Bulldog and Chihuahua), one with a high load of inherited  diseases not directly related to conformation (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel),  and one representing the same size range but without extreme conformation and  with the same level of disease as the overall dog population (Cairn Terrier), we  investigated this seeming paradox. We examined planning and motivational factors  behind acquisition of the dogs, and whether levels of experienced health and  behavior problems were associated with the quality of the owner-dog relationship  and the intention to re-procure a dog of the same breed. Owners of each of the  four breeds (750/breed) were randomly drawn from a nationwide Danish dog registry  and invited to participate. Of these, 911 responded, giving a final sample of  846. There were clear differences between owners of the four breeds with respect  to degree of planning prior to purchase, with owners of Chihuahuas exhibiting  less. Motivations behind choice of dog were also different. Health and other  breed attributes were more important to owners of Cairn Terriers, whereas the  dog's personality was reported to be more important for owners of French Bulldogs  and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels but less important for Chihuahua owners.  Higher levels of health and behavior problems were positively associated with a  closer owner-dog relationship for owners of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and  Chihuahuas but, for owners of French Bulldogs, high levels of problems were  negatively associated with an intention to procure the same breed again. In light  of these findings, it appears less paradoxical that people continue to buy dogs  with welfare problems.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0172091","","2","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28234931  PMCID: PMC5325474","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Species Specificity; Surveys and Questionnaires; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Phenotype; *Breeding; *Choice Behavior; Motivation; Probability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, age of first diagnosis, breed, and  gender data for all breeds of dogs were collected from the VMDB with the clinical  diagnosis of primary glaucoma (glaucoma-NOS) at 5-10 year intervals from 1964 to  2002. The prevalence for each breed (affected dogs compared to all dogs of each  breed), any changes over the 38 years, and any gender differences for these  glaucomas were determined. RESULTS: The prevalence of the primary breed-related  glaucomas has gradually increased from 0.29% (1964-1973); 0.46% (1974-1983);  0.76% (1984-1993); to 0.89% (1994-2002). Breeds that consistently featured among  the highest 10 for glaucoma prevalence from four different periods (1964 to 2002)  included American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Wire Fox Terrier, and Boston  Terrier. During the last observation period (1994-2002), 22 different breeds had  1% or higher prevalence of the glaucomas. The highest prevalence of glaucomas in  1994-2002 by breed included: American Cocker Spaniel (5.52%); Basset Hound  (5.44%); Chow Chow (4.70%); Shar-Pei (4.40%); Boston Terrier (2.88%); Wire Fox  Terrier (2.28%); Norwegian ElkHound (1.98%); Siberian Husky (1.88%); Cairn  Terrier (1.82%); and Miniature Poodle (1.68%). A predominance of females with  glaucoma occurred in the American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier,  Chow Chow, English Cocker Spaniel, Samoyed, and perhaps the Siberian Husky, and a  predominance of males in the Australian Cattle dog and St Bernard. Age affected  the time for first presentation of the glaucomas in the pure-bred dog. In the  majority of breeds the glaucomas were presented for initial diagnosis in dogs  between 4 and 10 years of age. CONCLUSION: Breed-related glaucomas in pure-bred  dogs are frequently presented to the veterinary medical teaching hospitals in  North America. The prevalence of the breed-related glaucomas in the dog appears  similar to humans, and in some breeds exceeds that in humans. In many breeds the  high prevalence of the glaucomas suggests a genetic basis.","2004-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","97-111","","2","7","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 14982589","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Prevalence; Pedigree; Records/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics; United States/epidemiology; Glaucoma/epidemiology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  purpose of this work was to evaluate among 288 healthy dogs if the levels of Can  f 1 on fur vary between breeds (German Shepherd, Pyrenean Shepherd, Poodle,  Cocker spaniel, Spaniel, Griffon, Labrador retriever and Yorkshire terrier),  gender, hormonal status, hair length, and according to the presence of seborrhea.  METHODS: Each dog was shaved in a limited area and Can f 1 concentrations were  measured in mug/g fur by ELISA. The results (geometric mean values and 95%  confidence intervals) were analyzed using analysis of variance and with  nonparametric tests. RESULTS: A wide variability in Can f 1 levels was found  between dog breeds, from Labradors [1.99 (0.03-129.91)] to Yorkshires [16.72  (3.67-76.16)] and Poodles [17.04 (2.79-103.94)] but only the Labrador levels were  significantly different from each other breed. Males produced more Can f 1 than  females, 11.75 (1.27-108.40) vs 8.89 (0.91-86.39). No difference was found  according to hair length or hormonal status. The seborrheic status highly (P =  0.0019) influenced the presence of Can f 1 on hair: 16.66 (1.59-173.96) vs 9.40  (1.03-85.70).

In both cases, surgical excision revealed a  multilobular cyst filling the whole orbital cavity. Histopathologic examination  and immunostaining for glial fibrillary acid protein and S100 protein supported a  diagnosis of neural cysts associated with ocular dysplasia. The definitive  diagnosis was congenital cystic eye and microphthalmos with cyst for the Cocker  Spaniel and miniature poodle, respectively. Karyotype was normal in both dogs.  Congenital cystic eye and microphthalmos with cyst result from defects in early  embryonic life that arise following formation of the optic vesicle and prior to  closure of the optic fissure.

STUDY  DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. ANIMALS: Cavalier King Charles spaniels  (n=15). METHODS: After diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dogs had  cranial cervical decompression with durotomy. Seven dogs had the durotomy patched  with biocompatible collagen matrix. Clinical outcome was monitored for >12  months. RESULTS: All dogs either improved (80%) or were unchanged (20%)  postoperatively. Postoperative MRI in 6 dogs revealed persistence of  syringomyelia. Seven dogs (47%) subsequently deteriorated, 0.2-2.3 years after  surgery (mean, 1.3 years) and 2 dogs were eventually euthanatized as a  consequence. Twelve dogs were still alive, 1-6.5 years after surgery (mean, 2.5  years). CONCLUSION: Cranial cervical decompression surgery is associated with low  mortality and morbidity, and results in clinical improvement in most dogs. The  procedure seemingly does not result in syrinx collapse and resolution. Clinical  improvement may not be sustained and some dogs can be expected to deteriorate.  CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cranial cervical decompression surgery may have a role in  management of CM/SM. In dogs with severe pain, it can improve quality of life for  several years; however, it does not appear to adequately address the primary  cause of syringomyelia. Further prospective study is needed to better understand  the pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder. Because this condition causes  neuropathic pain but does not necessarily result in euthanasia more information  is needed on appropriate pain management for these patients.","2007-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","396-405","","5","36","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17614920","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Pain/veterinary; Quality of Life; Neurologic Examination/veterinary; Decompression, Surgical/methods/*veterinary; Survival Analysis; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/mortality/surgery/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/mortality/*surgery; Nerve Compression Syndromes/mortality/surgery/*veterinary; Pain Management; Spinal Cord/surgery; Syringomyelia/mortality/surgery/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood from 69 clinically normal Cavaliers was  collected and anticoagulated with ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and  citrate. Automated and manual platelet counts were obtained. Percent platelet  aggregation in response to ADP (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 microM) was determined.  Electron microscopy was performed to examine platelet internal morphology and  dense granule distribution. A cardiologist recorded the quality of murmurs.  RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia (<100,000/microL) was present in 51.43% (36/69) of  Cavaliers. Macrothrombocytes (>3 microm) were present in 33.33% (22/69). Mean  manual platelet count was 118,770/microL. Manual (EDTA blood) and automated (EDTA  and citrated blood) methods of platelet counting were correlated. Prevalence of  cardiac murmurs was 38% (26/69). There was no association between affected dogs  and murmur, signalment, or coat color. Mean percent platelet aggregation was  significantly higher in controls than in Cavaliers (79% vs 38%, p=0.001).  Response to ADP was unaffected by thrombocytopenia, macrothrombocytes, murmur, or  any combination thereof. Platelet electron microscopy showed normal and giant  sized platelets with normal internal morphology. CONCLUSIONS: A benign inherited  giant platelet disorder affects approximately 50% of Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, macrothrombocytes, or  decreased platelet aggregation in response to ADP. Platelet ultrastructure is  normal. Citrated or EDTA blood provides accurate platelet counts. Further studies  are indicated to determine platelet glycoprotein structure and any association  with mitral endocardiosis. Cavaliers may be useful models of inherited giant  platelet disorders.","2004-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","344-350","","4","32","","Exp Hematol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 15050744","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Prevalence; Disease Models, Animal; Dog Diseases/blood/*genetics; Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology; Bernard-Soulier Syndrome/blood/genetics/*veterinary; Bleeding Time; Blood Platelets/ultrastructure; Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure; Hair Color; Heart Murmurs; Inbreeding; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/genetics; Platelet Aggregation/drug effects; Platelet Count; Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Breeding experiments  produced F1, F1BC, and F2 generations in which 29 XX true hermaphrodites and 3 XX  males were defined by chromosome constitution, serial histologic sections of the  gonads, and examination of the internal and external genitalia. In XX true  hermaphrodites, the most common combination of gonads was bilateral ovotestes,  followed by ovotestis and ovary, then ovotestis and testis. The amount of  testicular tissue in the two gonads was closely correlated within each true  hermaphrodite. The distribution of testicular tissue within ovotestes of true  hermaphrodites was consistent with the hypothesis that testicular differentiation  is initiated in the center of the gonad and spreads outward. XX males had  bilateral aspermatogenic testes and the internal ducts and external genitalia  were more masculinized than in true hermaphrodites. Results of breeding  experiments are consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, the affected  phenotype being expressed only in dogs with an XX chromosome constitution. The  phenotypic expression and mode of inheritance of this disorder is compared to XX  sex reversal in humans and other animals.","1988-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","23-30","","1","80","","Hum Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 3417302","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Pedigree; Dogs/*genetics; Dog Diseases/genetics; Testis/pathology; *X Chromosome; *Disorders of Sex Development/genetics; Ovary/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All cases  were diagnosed by the Surgical Pathology Service of the Laboratory of Pathology  of the University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine, between January  1986 and March 1991. These cases were followed clinically to determine the  accuracy of the initial histopathologic diagnosis. Data were analyzed by Fisher's  exact test for discrete data and the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous data. A  probability of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The following  breeds were affected with pemphigus foliaceus: Akita, Brittany Spaniel, Chow  Chow, Collie, Dachshund, Doberman Pinscher, English Cocker Spaniel, English  Setter, Golden Retriever, Siberian Husky, Laborador Retriever, Miniature  Schnauzer, Old English Sheepdog, Scottish Terrier, Chinese Shar Pei, Spitz,  Shetland Sheep Dog, Weimeraner, and West Highland White Terrier.

Dysplasia usually was not associated with incomplete  differentiation of the outer neuroblastic layer. The outer limiting membrane was  absent locally and numerous patent subretinal capillaries existed in the region  of folds. The dysplastic features may be related to aberrant development of  Muller cells and of retinal capillaries.

The activity of the renin-angiotensin  system early in the course of heart disease and heart failure in dogs was  evaluated by measuring the plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone  concentration (PAC) in 18 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with asymptomatic or  mildly symptomatic mitral valvular insufficiency, and in 18 healthy Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels. All dogs were unmedicated and had no other diseases. The PRA  was high in the dogs with mitral valvular insufficiency (median 3.44 ng/mL/h,  interquartile interval 2.59 to 8.66 ng/mL/h) compared with the controls (median  2.51 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 1.44 to 3.58 ng/mL/h).

Fourteen lesions were seen, commonly (11 of  14) within the gray matter of the cerebellar hemispheres or vermis. Thirteen  lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images (in 11 dogs) and one was  hypointense. Eleven of 14 lesions were within the region supplied by the rostral  cerebellar artery or one of its main branches and there was no, or minimal, mass  effect. Contrast enhancement was only seen in six lesions and was mild in all.  Gradient-echo images provided additional information in two dogs. The appearance  of infarction in dogs with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is similar to that in  humans, and provided supportive evidence for the diagnosis of infarction in five  dogs. The use of gradient-echo and DWI is recommended for the evaluation of  suspected cerebrovascular accidents in dogs. Six of the 12 affected animals were  spaniels or spaniel crosses, suggesting a possible breed predisposition.","2005-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1-10","","1","46","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15693551","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods/*veterinary; England/epidemiology; Predictive Value of Tests; Cerebellar Diseases/pathology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/epidemiology/*pathology; Stroke/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design-Retrospective case  series. ANIMALS: 172 dogs (290 eyes) that underwent phacoemulsification surgery  for cataract removal. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed for postoperative  complications; prevalence rates for each complication were calculated for  follow-up periods of 3 months, > 3 to 6 months, > 6 months to 1 year, > 1 to 2  years, > 2 to 3 years, > 3 to 4 years, and > 4 years. Odds ratios for breed, age,  sex, cataract hypermaturity, lens-induced uveitis, and diabetes mellitus were  determined with respect to glaucoma and failure (ie, blindness, enucleation, or  evisceration). RESULTS: The most common complication was mild posterior capsule  opacification. Retinal detachment was uncommon (1% to 2%) for all time periods.  Prevalence of glaucoma increased with time, although it remained < 10% until  after the 1-year follow-up period. Boston Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Cocker  Spaniel-Poodle crosses, and Shih Tzus had increased risk of developing glaucoma.  Eyes with hypermature cataracts were more likely to develop glaucoma. Prevalence  of failure increased with time, although it remained < 10% until after the 3-year  follow-up period. Cocker Spaniel-Poodle cross and Shih Tzus were more likely to  have failure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Evaluation of breed and  cataract hypermaturity may aid in the selection of patients.

METHODS: An  autosomal recessive form of progressive hereditary nephritis (HN) was studied in  10 affected, 3 obligate carrier, and 4 unaffected English cocker spaniel (ECS)  dogs. Clinical, pathological, and ultrastructural features of the disease were  characterized. Expression of basement membrane (BM) proteins was examined with an  immunohistochemical technique using monospecific antibodies. RESULTS: Affected  dogs had proteinuria and juvenile-onset chronic renal failure. Glomerular  basement membrane (GBM) thickening and multilamellation typical of HN were  observed in all renal specimens obtained from proteinuric dogs, and severity of  GBM ultrastructural abnormalities varied with the clinical stage of disease.  Expression of alpha3(IV) and alpha4(IV) chains was totally absent in the kidney  of affected dogs. Expression of alpha5(IV) and a6(IV) chains was normal in  Bowman's capsule, collecting tubular BM and epidermal BM of affected dogs. The  alpha5(IV) chain was not expressed in distal tubular BM of affected dogs.  Expression of alpha5(IV) chains was markedly reduced but not absent, and  expression of alpha6(IV) chains was present in GBM of affected dogs. Expression  of alpha1-alpha2(IV) chains in GBM of affected dogs was increased. Features of  obligate carriers were similar to those of unaffected dogs. CONCLUSIONS: We  conclude that HN in ECS dogs is a naturally occurring animal model of autosomal  recessive Alport syndrome. However, it differs from human disease in the  persistence of alpha5(IV) chains in GBM and in the appearance of a6(IV) chains in  GBM.","1998-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","706-719","","3","54","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9734596","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Female; Male; Immunohistochemistry; *Disease Models, Animal; Collagen/analysis; Kidney/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure; Nephritis, Hereditary/metabolism/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have examined the opsin gene for polymorphisms in several  breeds of pedigree dog suffering from distinct forms of gPRA, by methods  including single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, microsatellite  analysis and direct sequencing. The breeds examined included the Tibetan terrier,  the miniature schnauzer, the Irish setter, the miniature poodle, the Labrador  retriever and the English cocker spaniel, as well as individuals from breeds in  which PRA has not been described and of mixed breed. Individuals from each of the  named breeds suffering from PRA were compared with clinically normal dogs. Two  polymorphisms were found. One, segregating within the Tibetan terrier population,  but not seen in other breeds, was a synonymous transition at nucleotide position  780 in exon 3. Inheritance of this polymorphism suggests that opsin is unlikely  to contain mutations causative of gPRA in this breed. The other polymorphism  occurred between all miniature schnauzers examined and dogs of other breeds. It  consisted of a single base insertion in intron 2. No polymorphisms in the opsin  sequence were detected in any other breed. DNA sequencing allowed rigorous  exclusion of mutations in opsin as a cause of gPRA in miniature poodles, English  cocker spaniels or Labrador retrievers.","1995-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","261-267","","4","26","","Anim Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7661398","","","","Animals; Species Specificity; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Mutation; Dogs/*genetics; *Polymorphism, Genetic; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Base Sequence; DNA Primers/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; DNA/genetics; Retinal Degeneration/genetics/*veterinary; Rod Opsins/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The site at which tumors occurred and the age and sex of the dogs were similar to those in previous  reports. The skin of the digits, chin, ear, and lip represented the most common  (17/29) tumor sites. Males and females were equally represented, and tumors  occurred in middle-aged to old dogs (mean age, 9.0 years).

Tumors were stained with  immunohistochemical markers (lambda light chain, K light chain) and thioflavine  T. Immunoreactivity was limited to either lambda or K light chains, consistent  with a monoclonal plasma cell population. The majority of tumors expressed lambda  light chains, consistent with previously reported canine plasma cell dyscrasias.  Thioflavine T cytoplasmic fluorescence was seen in the majority (18/29) of  plasmacytomas and with inflammatory plasma cells present in control specimens.  Other round cell neoplasms (lymphosarcoma, histiocytoma, and mastocytoma) were  negative with thioflavine T, indicating that positive staining with thioflavine T  was specific for plasma cells (neoplastic and inflammatory).

Persistent macrocytic hypochromic anemia with marked reticulocytosis  and metarubricytosis was found when CBC results were compared with reference  values for Whippets. Increased serum creatine kinase activity and hyperkalemia  also were sometimes present over the 4-year period of evaluation.

ANIMALS STUDIED: A  total of 10 eyes, four normal and six glaucomatous eyes, from normal and affected  American Cocker Spaniels with primary glaucoma were studied. All eyes were  assessed by neuro-ophthalmic examination, tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp  biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy prior to enucleation. METHODS:  Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed to evaluate BDNF and TrkB receptor  expression in retina and optic nerve in normal and glaucomatous dogs. RESULTS: In  all normal eyes BDNF immunostaining was detected in the cytoplasm of retinal  ganglion cells (RGC), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL),  nerve fiber layer (NFL), optic nerve head cells, and lamina cribosa cells. In all  glaucomatous eyes BDNF was more evident in RGC, NFL and lamina cribosa cells.  TrkB receptor was detected in the cytoplasm of RGC, NFL and ONH bundles in all  normal eyes, and in a more intense pattern in all glaucomatous eyes. CONCLUSIONS:  BDNF retrograde axonal transport is substantially inhibited by intraocular  pressure elevation. TrkB accumulation at the ONH in glaucoma suggests a role for  neurotrophin deprivation in the pathogenesis of RGC death in canine glaucoma, as  well as a possible paracrine and/or autocrine signaling within the lamina  cribosa. Neurotrophin signaling may regulate more than neuronal development,  survival and differentiation. BDNF neurotrophin and its TrkB receptor expression  by lamina cribosa cells and ONH astrocytes in glaucomatous eyes may help to  determine the role of these cells as a paracrine source in terms of retinal  ganglion cell survival, during episodes of elevated intraocular pressure.","2007-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","12-19","","","10 Suppl 1","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17973830","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Case-Control Studies; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*metabolism; *Axonal Transport; Axons/metabolism; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism; Glaucoma/metabolism/*veterinary; Optic Nerve/metabolism; Receptor, trkB/*metabolism; Retinal Ganglion Cells/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS STUDIED:  Gonioscopy was performed on 279 English Springer Spaniel dogs, 119 males and 160  females, with clinically normal eyes. In addition, 14 dogs, five males and nine  females were examined for glaucoma. RESULTS: A positive relation between  pectinate ligament dysplasia (PLD) and narrowing of the relative width of the  ciliary cleft (RWOCC) and also between PLD, RWOCC and age was demonstrated. The  prevalence of PLD was 25.5%, which is higher than in other breeds reported. A  positive association was demonstrated between PLD and glaucoma, as well as  between narrowing of the RWOCC and glaucoma. Glaucoma was not observed in dogs  with normal appearance of the iridocorneal angle. English Springer Spaniels  related to dogs with glaucoma show more narrowing of the RWOCC and more PLD than  unrelated dogs. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the positive association  between PLD and glaucoma, between narrowing of the iridocorneal angle and  glaucoma and the effect of age on the iridocorneal angle. Mating of dogs with  normal iridocorneal angles appears to reduce the presence and degree of abnormal  appearance of the iridocorneal angle in the offspring.

The amount of myelin at each location increased with age. Axonal  calibre also increased and there was no difference between the axonal diameters  of affected and age-matched normal pups. Axons were either naked or surrounded by  a disproportionately thin layer of myelin. Myelinated internodes tended to be  short and heminodes were frequent. Vacuoles were present adjacent to axons or  within glia but there was no evidence of demyelination. Total glial numbers were  not reduced and numerous oligodendroglial and astrocytic nuclei identified.  Peripheral, cranial and autonomic nerves were myelinated normally. It is  suggested that there is an abnormality of oligodendroglial metabolism such that  they cannot form and maintain normal myelin. Consequently the radial and  longitudinal extensions of their plasma membranes are reduced. The vacuoles may  represent a breakdown of defective myelin lipids as suggested in certain murine  mutants. This defect of myelination provides a further model in which normal and  disordered myelinogenesis can be studied.","1981-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","423-433","","3","50","","J Neurol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 7196438","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*genetics/pathology; Disease Models, Animal; Genes, Recessive; Central Nervous System Diseases/pathology/*veterinary; Central Nervous System/*pathology; Myelin Sheath/*pathology; Optic Nerve/pathology; Tremor/*veterinary; X Chromosome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cardiac murmurs were  present in 59 of the dogs and the intensity of the systolic cardiac murmur,  assessed by auscultation (grade 1-6), was correlated (P < .001) to the severity  of CVD (heart failure class) and to the echocardiographic dimensions of the heart  (left atrial ratio, La/Ao-d, and left ventricular end diastolic diameter, LVEDD)  (both P < .001). The heart sounds and duration of electromechanical systole  (Q-S2) were investigated in all dogs using measurements obtained from PCG  recordings. Normal regression equations describing the relation between heart  rate and systolic intervals (Q-S1, Q-S2 and S1-S2) were established based on  observations in 11 normal control Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. The total  electromechanical systole (Q-S2), Q-S1, and S1-S2 intervals in the 59 dogs were  related to the corresponding normal regression equation. A shortening of Q-S2 and  S1-S2 intervals were found in dogs belonging to heart failure class I (Q-S2; P <  .01 and S1-S2; P < .05), class II, and classes III and IV (both P < .001). The  ratio of the amplitudes of the first (S1) and second heart sounds (S2) measured  on the PCG recordings was found to be increased in dogs belonging to class I (P <  .01), class II, and classes III and IV (both P < .001). The relationship between  cardiac dimensions (LVEDD and La/Ao-d) and S1a/S2a ratio was described by  quadratic regression and found to be significant for both parameters (LVEDD; P <  .001, R2 = .54 and La/Ao-d; P < .001, R2 = .63). The presence of a third heart  sound (S3) was detected, using PCG, in 21 of the 68 dogs. The proportion of dogs  exhibiting S3 increased with heart failure class (and increasing cardiac  dimensions) (P < .001). These findings were confirmed by observations in 13  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with cardiac failure progressing from heart  failure class I to class II (Mean LVEDD from 30.2 to 35.2 mm and mean La/Ao-d  from 1.09 to 1.43). An increase in intensity of the heart murmur, assessed by  auscultation, increase in the ratio of the amplitudes of S1 and S2, as well as a  shortening in Q-S2 and S1-S2 intervals (all P < .01) were found in these  dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1995-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","75-85","","2","9","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7760313","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*physiopathology; Severity of Illness Index; Chronic Disease; Electrocardiography/veterinary; Analysis of Variance; *Heart Sounds; Heart Murmurs/physiopathology/*veterinary; Heart Valve Diseases/physiopathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: 41 Beagles, 43  Labrador Retrievers, 25 Golden Retrievers, 26 English Springer Spaniels, and 22  Shetland Sheepdogs. PROCEDURE: Beagles had STT and STTa values measured twice  daily for 5 days. Client-owned dogs of 4 other breeds had STT and STTa values  measured once. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD values of Beagles for STT and STTa were 20.2  +/- 2.5 and 3.8 +/- 2.7 mm/min. Mean values for STT and STTa were as follows:  Labrador Retriever, 22.9 +/- 4.1 and 9.6 +/- 3.8 mm/min; English Springer  Spaniel; 20.7 +/- 3.2 and 5.4 +/- 3.4 mm/min; Golden Retriever, 21.8 + 3.7 and  8.8 +/- 3.1 mm/min; and Shetland Sheepdog, 15.8 +/- 1.8 and 3.6 +/- 2.8 mm/min.  Overall mean values for STT and STTa were 20.2 +/- 3.0 and 6.2 +/- 3.1 mm/min.  Differences for STT and STTa were detected among breeds, but significant  differences were not associated with sex or age within each breed or in overall  values for all dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results for the STT  reported here compare favorably with reported values, except for results of  Shetland Sheepdogs; however, results for the STTa differ dramatically from  reported values. Clinicians should consider effects attributable to breed when  evaluating results of STT and STTa in dogs.","2000-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1422-1425","","11","61","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11108191","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Reference Values; Sex Factors; Age Factors; Dogs/*physiology; Administration, Topical; Anesthesia, Local/*veterinary; Anesthetics, Local/*pharmacology; Circadian Rhythm; Dog Diseases/diagnosis; Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca/diagnosis/veterinary; Propoxycaine/*pharmacology; Tears/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although canine erythrocytes are in general known to be more alkaline  fragile, erythrocytes from both patients began to lyse earlier, at significantly  lower pH values (near pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C), than erythrocytes from control  dogs. Hyperventilation induced by 30 minutes of exercise, placement in a 39  degrees C water bath, or intravenous doxapram increased venous blood pH in dog 1  and control dogs, but transient hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and severe  bilirubinuria occurred only in the studied patient. The erythrocyte  phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity was severely decreased in both dogs (10% of  controls). The erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate content was markedly reduced  and the cell chloride content was consequently increased. This change in cell  chloride content is related to an increase in the erythrocyte pH, which may  partially explain the pathogenesis of hemolysis in canine PFK deficiency. Thus,  these studies demonstrate a presumably inherited erythrocyte PFK deficiency in  English springer spaniels, which causes an increased in vitro and in vivo  erythrocyte alkaline fragility. Dogs with PFK deficiency and inducible hemolytic  crises may become a valuable genetic animal model in which to study the  pathophysiology of hemolysis.","1985-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","345-351","","2","65","","Blood","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3155631","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Erythrocytes/enzymology; Phosphofructokinase-1/blood/*deficiency; *Osmotic Fragility; Anemia, Hemolytic/*blood/etiology/genetics; Doxapram; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hyperventilation/blood/chemically induced/*physiopathology; In Vitro Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dog had a massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain. The  beta-hexosaminidase activity in this affected dog brain was approximately 12  times higher than that of normal brain. However, the activity toward  p-nitrophenyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranoside was only four times  higher in the affected brain than in normal brain. The GM2 activator preparation  obtained from the normal dog brain could stimulate the hydrolysis of GM2  ganglioside by beta-hexosaminidase isolated from the affected dog. However, the  corresponding activator fraction from the affected dog could not stimulate such a  reaction. It was concluded that the biochemical basis of the GM2 gangliosidosis  in this Japanese Spaniel was due to the attenuation in the stimulatory activity  of GM2 activator.

At the time of diagnosis they were between three  and seven years old; however, early ophthalmoscopic changes caused by the  thinning of the retina could sometimes be difficult to observe because of the  partial or total lack of the tapetum in many of the dogs. The disease developed  rapidly, approximately one year passing from the initial clinical signs of night  blindness to complete loss of vision. Twenty-four male and 27 female dogs were  affected. All the affected dogs were interrelated and could be traced back to  common English ancestors. On the basis of pedigree studies, an autosomal  recessive mode of inheritance is postulated. Information on 15 diagnosed cases of  the condition in other countries shows that the disease may be considered a  worldwide problem in the Tibetan spaniel.","1994-04-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","377-379","","15","134","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8009801","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Pedigree; *Dog Diseases/genetics/pathology; Atrophy/veterinary; Norway; Retina/*pathology; Retinal Degeneration/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Sweden","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chemotaxis  and random migration in affected and heterozygous dogs were found to be  comparable to those of control dogs. Increased (P less than or equal to 0.05)  neutrophil adhesion, antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, iodination of  proteins, and oxygen radical production in neutrophils from affected dogs were  probably the result of chronic bacterial infection in vivo. Bacterial ingestion  by neutrophils from the three heterozygous English Springer Spaniel dogs was  significantly increased compared to control dogs but was not different from  affected English Springer Spaniel dogs, suggesting a breed-related phenomenon.  Significant decreases in neutrophil function were not seen in any of the dogs  with congenital ciliary dyskinesia, indicating that a defective microtubular  system is not shared by respiratory cilia and neutrophils and that defective  neutrophil function does not contribute to respiratory infection.","1991-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","347-353","","5","28","","Vet Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1750159","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity; Cell Adhesion; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Ciliary Motility Disorders/congenital/immunology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/congenital/*immunology; Free Radicals; Immunoglobulins/blood; Iodine/metabolism; Neutrophils/*immunology; Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen/metabolism; Phagocytosis; Respiratory Burst","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The external limiting membrane of  the retina of normal canine fetuses was composed of zonulae adherentes in which  there were focal areas of apparent apposition between adjacent ventricular cell  membranes. Freeze-fracture examination revealed gap junctions within the external  limiting membrane that were composed of 8-10 nm P-face particles in aggregates of  variable size and shape. These junctions corresponded to areas of focal membrane  apposition. Tight junction strands were also identified in deep E-face grooves  which were located perpendicular to the external limiting membrane. At day 46 of  gestation in incipiently dysplastic English springer spaniel fetal eyes, there  was a marked decrease in the size and area occupied by gap junctions within the  external limiting membrane as compared with retinas of mongrel control fetuses at  the same age and of other age groups. This apparent loss of gap junctions,  coincident with the incipient onset of histologically detectable dysplastic  events in the sensory retina, may contribute to the morphogenesis of the defect.","1986","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","231-239","","2","18","","Tissue Cell","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Scotland PMID: 3705056","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure; Fetus/pathology; Freeze Fracturing/methods; Retina/abnormalities/embryology/growth & development/*ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement","","0449-3087","","","Data from two population-based studies in four Norwegian counties were used to calculate the crude incidence of mammary tumours, and the age- and breed-specific  incidence of mammary tumours in female dogs of three different breeds. The  largest study comprised 14401 histologically verified tumour cases from four  counties covered by the Norwegian Canine Cancer Register. The registry covers  about 25% of the total Norwegian dog population. The second study was a census in  Norway that was sent to all owners of the following breeds: boxers, bichon frisé  and Bernese mountain dogs, to estimate the age distribution of the female dog  population at risk of developing mammary tumours. The crude incidence of  malignant mammary tumours in female dogs of any breed was 53.3%. The highest  relative risk ratio of mammary tumours was found in boxers, cocker spaniels,  English springer spaniels and dachshunds. The mean age of histologically  diagnosed mammary tumours was 7.9 years in boxers and 7.8 years in springer  spaniels, compared with 8.8 years in all other breeds. In the four Norwegian  counties from 1992 to 1997, the population-based incidence rates (for all ages)  of malignant mammary tumours per 1000 female dogs per year were 35.47 in boxers,  3.87 in Bernese mountain dogs and 17.69 in bichon frisé. Mammary cancer is the  most common tumour in female dogs in Norway, and represents a population of  almost entirely reproductively intact females. The age-specific incidence rates  for mammary cancer vary considerably among the three breeds that were studied in  detail.","2001","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","439-443","","","57","","J Reprod Fertil Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11787188","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Odds Ratio; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology; Risk; *Breeding; Incidence; Databases, Factual; Age Distribution; Registries; Norway; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about pulmonary blood volume (PBV), blood  pulmonary transit time (PTT), and the regulation of these. OBJECTIVES: To measure  and evaluate the relationships of PBV, forward stroke volume (FSV), and heart  rate normalized blood pulmonary transit time (nPTT) in healthy dogs and dogs with  MR. ANIMALS: Thirty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; 11 healthy, 4 in  modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 11 in class II, and 7 in CHF.  METHODS: Heart rate normalized PTTs were measured by radionuclide  angiocardiography. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic diameter, left  atrial/aortic root ratio, and FSV were measured by echocardiography. PBV and  pulmonary blood volume index (PBVI) were calculated by established formulas.  RESULTS: PBVI was 308±56 (mean±SD) mL/m2 for healthy dogs, 287±51 mL/m2 in NYHA  class I, 360±66 mL/m2 in Class II, and 623±232 mL/m2 in CHF (P=.0008). Heart rate  normalized PTT, not FSV, was a predictor of PBV (r=0.92 and 0.02, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Increased PBV, not decreased FSV, is the  main cause of increased nPTT in MR. Increased nPTT can be used as an indicator of  abnormal cardiopulmonary function in dogs with MR.","2010-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1393-1399","","6","24","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20958790","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*physiopathology; Blood Volume; Lung/*physiopathology; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/classification/physiopathology/*veterinary; Pulmonary Edema/physiopathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also aimed to determine if significant differences  existed when counting platelets manually, by auto analyser or by blood smear  estimation in CKCS and mixed breed dogs. METHODS: Blood was collected from 172  dogs (152 CKCS and 20 mixed breed) and placed into sodium-citrate anticoagulant.  Platelet counts were performed manually, by auto analyser and by blood smear  estimates in CKCS and mixed breed dogs. Blood smears were also examined for  platelet clumping and erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet morphology. Pedigree  analysis was performed to determine if an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern  was supported. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in  platelet counts between CKCS and mixed breed dogs (P < 0.0001). CKCS had a  platelet count that was 32% that of the controls (95% confidence interval, 28 to  37%). There was no significant difference between methods used to count  platelets. Thirty percent of CKCS had macrothrombocytes. Pedigree analysis and  examination of obtained and expected segregation ratios from 17 CKCS families  supported an autosomal recessive pattern of Mendelian inheritance. CONCLUSIONS: A  high prevalence of idiopathic macrothrombocytopenia exists in CKCS in NSW and  automated or blood smear estimates are sufficient to count platelet numbers. Data  supports an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.","2005-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","700-703","","11","83","","Aust Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16315671","","","","Animals; Dogs; *Pedigree; Female; Male; Autoanalysis/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/*genetics; New South Wales/epidemiology; *Genes, Recessive; Platelet Count/veterinary; Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/epidemiology/genetics/*veterinary; Seroepidemiologic Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 289 dogs identified  through the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB) and 27 dogs examined at the North  Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. PROCEDURE: Demographic  characteristics of dogs identified through the VMDB were compared with  characteristics of the entire population of dogs entered in the VMDB. Medical  records of dogs examined at the teaching hospital were reviewed; the diagnosis  was confirmed through review of thoracic radiographs. RESULTS: Analysis of data  from the VMDB indicated that American Cocker Spaniels, West Highland White  Terriers, Miniature Poodles, Siberian Huskies, English Springer Spaniels, and  dogs > 10 years old had an increased risk of bronchiectasis. Among dogs examined  at the teaching hospital, coughing was the most common clinical sign. There was  evidence for excessive airway mucus but not hemorrhage. A variety of bacterial  organisms were isolated from tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. On  thoracic radiographs, cylindrical bronchiectasis, generalized disease, and right  cranial lung lobe involvement were most common. Seven of 14 dogs for which  follow-up radiographs were available did not have any progression of radiographic  lesions. Median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis of bronchiectasis  was 9 months (range, 1 day to 10 years). Median survival time was 16 months  (range, 2 days to 72 months). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest  that despite substantial clinical abnormalities, dogs with bronchiectasis may  survive for years.

Since acidic excitatory amino acids  and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) are reduced in spinal  cord and cerebral cortex in ALS, the levels of these substances were measured in  nervous tissue in Brittany Spaniels heterozygous and homozygous for HCSMA.  Significant reductions in the levels of endogenous aspartate, glutamate,  N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and NAAG were found in the spinal cord in homozygous but  not heterozygous HCSMA. In contrast, the activity of  N-acetylated-alpha-linked-amino dipeptidase (NAALADase), an enzyme that cleaves  NAAG into NAA and Glu, was significantly increased. None of these parameters was  affected in the motor cortex or occipital cortex. Since NAA and NAAG are highly  concentrated in motoneurons, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of motor  neuron disease.","1993-12-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","305-309","","2","629","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 8111634","","","","Animals; Dogs; Biomarkers; Amino Acids/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism; Brain Chemistry/physiology; Dipeptides/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism; Dog Diseases/genetics/*metabolism; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal/genetics/*metabolism/veterinary; Neuropeptides/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism; Spinal Cord/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intermittent severe pigmenturia concomitant with  weakness, lethargy, and anorexia were the major clinical signs and commonly were  related to exercise or other stressful situations that caused panting or barking  (hyperventilation). Pale or icteric mucous membranes, fever, mild  hepatosplenomegaly, and muscle wasting sometimes were evident. Results of routine  laboratory testing indicated a persistent marked bilirubinuria and  reticulocytosis with normal PCV, to severe anemia and intermittent hemoglobinuria  and hyperkalemia. Erythrocyte PFK activities were severely reduced to 8% to 22%  of values for control dogs. The block of glycolysis at the PFK step caused a  markedly diminished erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate content, resulting in an  increased hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and compensatory accelerated erythrocyte  production. Phosphofructokinase-deficient erythrocytes had increased alkaline  fragility in vitro and in vivo. Hemolytic crises were induced in vivo by  hyperventilation that caused transient, mild alkalemia. Studies of family members  of a PFK-deficient dog suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

Logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios for the proportion of each  affected breed compared to those of crossbreeds. The annual incidence of  urolithiasis was evaluated by the number of submissions compared to the estimated  number of dogs in the population from which the samples originated. Epidemiologic  data revealed a relatively high and increasing proportion of struvite  urolithiasis. Statistical analysis of breed predispositions resulted in the  detection of breeds not having been reported at risk (e.g. Bernese Mountain dog -  struvite, Bichon Frise, Bolognese, Tibetan Terrier - purine, French Bulldog -  cystine).

ANIMALS: Seven hundred and fifty-nine  vestibular cases identified out of 905 544 study dogs. METHODS: Retrospective  cohort study. Potential VD cases clinically examined during 2016 were verified by  reviewing clinical records for signalment, presenting clinical signs, treatments,  and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors  associated with VD. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of VD was 8 per 10 000 dogs  (95% CI = 7-9). Median age at first diagnosis was 12.68 years (interquartile  range [IQR], 11.28-14.64).

Additionally,  breed-specific reference ranges for CKCS MV measurements are lacking. Study  objectives were to assess measurement repeatability and define optimal methods  for the longitudinal study of echocardiographic MV anatomy and to define  preliminary, two-dimensional echocardiographic reference ranges for MV  measurements in CKCS. ANIMALS: Forty CKCS between 10 and 24 months old. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Pre- and post-sedation two-dimensional echocardiographic images  optimized for the MV were obtained. The length, width, and area of the anterior  and posterior leaflets and the diameter of the MV annulus at end-diastole and  end-systole were measured. Measurement repeatability was assessed using %  coefficient of variation and repeatability coefficients. RESULTS: Intraoperator  repeatability was best for the operator with previous MV measurement experience,  with comparable results for the experienced operator measuring the second  operator's images, mimicking a core echocardiography laboratory setting. Except  for MV annulus diameter at end-systole, sedation had no significant effect on any  MV measurements, nor did it impact measurement repeatability. Preliminary,  breed-specific reference ranges were defined for the population, with CKCS often  noted to have a larger annular diameter at end-systole than end-diastole.  CONCLUSIONS: Optimal methods for longitudinal study of the MV in CKCS have been  proposed, as have two-dimensional preliminary echocardiographic reference ranges  for CKCS MV measurements. The MV annulus in CKCS may differ from other breeds.","2022-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","81-92","","","43","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In a previous study of 68 ESS with CH, in which only one dog  received corticosteroids, a median survival time of 189 days was noted. Some ESS  with CH appear to improve with prednisolone treatment; therefore, we aimed to  investigate the response to prednisolone in this breed. PARTICIPANTS: ESS with  histologically confirmed idiopathic CH were treated with prednisolone 1-2  mg/kg/day. Nine female and three male ESS were enrolled (median age at diagnosis  of five years). Patients were monitored clinically and had biochemistry samples  taken to assess markers of hepatocellular damage and function. RESULTS: The mean  starting dose of prednisolone was 1.1 mg/kg/day. All symptomatic patients showed  an initial clinical improvement. Two cases were euthanased while receiving  prednisolone. The median time since diagnosis is 1715 days (range: 672-2105 days)  and the remaining patients are clinically well, with seven patients still  receiving a mean dose of 0.4 mg/kg prednisolone every other day. Statistical  analysis demonstrated significant (P<0.05) reductions in serum alkaline  phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin following 2-4 weeks of  prednisolone treatment.

Significant differences were found between the  median BAER threshold for ears where effusions were present (60 dB nHL), compared  to those without (30 dB nHL) (P=0.001). The slopes of latency-intensity functions  from both groups did not differ, but the y-axis intercept when the x value was  zero was greater in dogs with effusions (P=0.009), consistent with conductive  hearing loss. Analysis of latency-intensity functions suggested the degree of  hearing loss due to middle ear effusion was 21 dB (95% confidence between 10 and  33 dB). Waves I-V inter-wave latency at 90 dB nHL was not significantly different  between the two groups. These findings demonstrate that middle ear effusion is  associated with a conductive hearing loss of 10-33 dB in affected dogs despite  the fact that all animals studied were considered to have normal hearing by their  owners.","2011-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","341-345","","3","188","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010.

A nested case-control  study was conducted during 2008 and 2009. Data were obtained from a stratified  random sample of veterinary practices throughout Great Britain, and  questionnaires were sent to owners of dogs with tail injuries and owners of a  randomly selected sample of dogs without tail injuries. The risks of injury were  reported adjusting for the sampling approach, and mixed effects logistic  regression was used to develop a multivariable model for risk factors associated  with tail injury. Two hundred and eighty-one tail injuries were recorded from a  population of 138,212 dogs attending 52 participating practices. The weighted  risk of tail injuries was 0.23 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 0.20 to  0.25 per cent). Thirty-six per cent of injuries were reportedly related to  injuries sustained in the home, 17.5 per cent were outdoor-related injuries, 14.4  per cent were due to the tail being caught in a door, for 16.5 per cent the cause  was unknown and the remainder were due to other causes. Dogs with a wide angle of  wag and dogs kept in kennels were at significantly higher risk of sustaining a  tail injury. Dogs with docked tails were significantly less likely to sustain a  tail injury; however, approximately 500 dogs would need to be docked in order to  prevent one tail injury. English springer spaniels, cocker spaniels, greyhounds,  lurchers and whippets were all at significantly higher risk when compared to  labradors and other retrievers. Differences between countries (England, Scotland  and Wales) and between rural and urban environments were not significant.","2010-06-26","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","812-817","","26","166","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20581358","","","","Animals; Breeding; Female; Male; Logistic Models; Risk Factors; Case-Control Studies; United Kingdom; Dogs/*injuries/surgery; Tail/*injuries/surgery; Environment; Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology/etiology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans, primary MVP is associated with increased platelet  reactivity. In Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), a breed predisposed to  myxomatous mitral valve disease, there is a high prevalence of hypomagnesemia and  platelet anomalies, such as thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytosis. The  objective of this study was to evaluate platelet aggregation responses in CKCS  and to determine the relationship between the platelet aggregation response and  serum magnesium concentration, MVP, mitral regurgitation (MR), and platelet  count. In 19 CKCS with MVP and 7 control dogs (not CKCS), the platelet  aggregation response to 3 different agonists was compared. The CKCS with >100,000  platelets/microL (n = 10) had a significantly higher maximum aggregation response  with regard to all tested agonists than the CKCS with <100,000 platelets/microL  (n = 9) and control dogs (n = 7). The CKCS with <100,000 platelets/microL had a  platelet aggregation response similar to the control dogs. There was no  correlation between degree of MVP and platelet aggregation response. Platelet  diameter increased (P = .006) and serum magnesium concentration decreased (P =  .04) with lower platelet concentration. In conclusion, CKCS with MVP appeared to  separate into 2 groups--1 group with <100,000 platelets/microL, normal platelet  aggregation, low serum magnesium concentration, and enlarged platelets, and  another group with >100,000 platelets/microL, increased platelet aggregation, and  normal serum magnesium concentration and platelet size.","2001-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","209-216","","3","15","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11380029","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; Case-Control Studies; Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; *Platelet Aggregation; Platelet Count/veterinary; Magnesium/blood; Mitral Valve Prolapse/physiopathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The samples included one tissue each from  17 males and six females 2 to 16 years of age (mean = 7.5 years). Twelve breeds  were represented, including three Cocker Spaniels, three Golden Retrievers, and  five of mixed breed. Ten of the samples were histologically classified as  malignant-plasma cell tumors, and ten specimens were classified as benign. Three  samples of plasmacytic inflammation, from two Cocker Spaniels and one Shih Tsu,  were included as controls.

This ADAMTS17 mutation was  identified in PLL-affected dogs from 14 additional breeds. PLL-affected dogs from  some breeds (most notably the Shar pei and the Brittany spaniel) did not carry  the G1473+1A ADAMTS17 mutation, indicating they must suffer from a genetically  distinct form of the condition. We also estimated the frequency of this ADAMTS17  mutation in some of the breeds. Our findings indicate the mutation segregates in  a large number of different breeds of dog, many of which are terriers or breeds  with terrier co-ancestry, but some of which have more diverse origins. Our  results also indicate that the mutation is present at high frequency within most  of the breeds in which it segregates. In the miniature bull terrier breed  estimates of mutation frequency ranged from 0.27 to 0.39, corresponding to  7.3-15.2% PLL-affected dogs in this breed.

The disease is  characterized by the production of autoantibodies against 2M myofibers contained  in masticatory muscle, although the cause of this production is still unclear.  The aim of the present case report was to describe the clinical presentation,  diagnostic findings, treatment, and follow-up of an atypical case of chronic  masticatory muscle myositis in a very young dog. A 5-month old Cavalier king  Charles Spaniel (CKCS) was presented to the AniCura Istituto Veterinario Novara  with a two weeks, progressive history of lethargy and difficulty in food  prehension.

A myopathy was suspected. Computed  tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay test for 2M antibodies, and histopathological examination of masticatory  muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of MMM. Glucocorticoids treatment was  started and clinical signs promptly improved.

Immunohistochemical staining by the indirect immunoperoxidase method was  positive, with desmosomal deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig) G.

Radiographic evaluation of the thorax and abdomen  revealed enlarged cranial mediastinal and sublumbar lymph nodes. Tru-Cut biopsy  from an enlarged lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma, which was  phenotyped as a B-cell tumour. The diagnosis in this case was systemic lupus  erythematosus, with the unusual feature of pemphigus foliaceus, and subsequent  development of B-cell lymphoma.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Sry high  mobility group (HMG) box is present in genomic DNA of affected dogs. Conserved  Sry HMG box and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) sequences were used  as primers in polymerase chain reactions. A 167 bp Y-specific canine Sry HMG box  sequence was cloned from genomic DNA of normal male dogs. Internal primers  generated a 104 bp Sry HMG box product from normal males, but not from females or  XX sex reversed dogs. Parallel reactions generated an HPRT product from all dogs.  Results indicate that the Sry HMG box is absent in genomic DNA of XX sex reversed  dogs.

Thromboelastography (TEG) has been shown to be a  valuable instrument for whole blood hemostatic evaluation in dogs and correlates  well with different physiologic and pathologic situations. OBJECTIVES: We aimed  to assess the influence of macrothrombocytopenia and the severity of MMVD on  hemostatic function as measured by TEG. METHODS: Associations between TEG  variables (R, K, α, MA, and G) and dog characteristics, heart rates, systolic  blood pressures, MMVD severities (healthy, mild or moderate, and severe),  echocardiographic variables, platelet variables (platelet count, mean platelet  volume [MPV], and plateletcrit), and hematocrits were evaluated in 47  prospectively recruited privately owned CKCSs. Blood samples were analyzed using  a computerized thromboelastograph and an Advia 2120 hematology analyzer. RESULTS:  Univariable and multiple regression analyses showed an effect of left ventricular  (LV) fractional shortening (FS%) on all TEG variables, an effect of LV FS% and  age on TEG α, and an effect of LV FS% and MPV on TEG MA and TEG G. TEG MA and G  increased with increasing MPV, but the associations were generally weak. No  significant differences were detected in the TEG variables between the MMVD  severity groups. CONCLUSION: Macrothrombocytopenia and increased LV FS%, of which  the latter commonly increases in various positive inotropic states, were both  associated with a more hypercoagulable hemostatic system, according to the TEG  results, in the present study.","2019-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","636-644","","4","48","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31650577","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; canine; Prospective Studies; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis; *Hemostasis; coagulation; Heart Valve Diseases/diagnosis/*veterinary; platelet function; Thrombelastography/*veterinary; thrombocytes; Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis/*veterinary; valvular disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have indicated a strong genetic background.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a breeding scheme  involving auscultation and echocardiography. ANIMALS: In the Danish Kennel Club  mandatory breeding scheme, 997 purebred CKCS were examined during the period  2002-2011. Each dog was evaluated 1-4 times with a total of 1,380 examinations.  METHODS: Auscultation and echocardiography were performed to evaluate mitral  regurgitation murmur severity and degree of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The odds  of having mitral regurgitation murmur or MVP > grade 1 in 2010-2011 compared to  2002-2003 were estimated using logistic regression analysis including age and sex  as covariates. Odds were estimated for dogs that were products of the breeding  scheme (defined as dogs with both parents approved by the breeding scheme before  breeding) and non-products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with at least  1 parent with unknown cardiac status). RESULTS: In 2010-2011, the odds of having  mitral regurgitation murmur were 0.27 if dogs were a product of the breeding  scheme compared with dogs in 2002-2003, reflecting a 73% decreased risk  (P < .0001). If non-products of the breeding scheme examined in 2010-2011 were  compared with dogs in 2002-2003, no difference in odds was found (P = .49).  CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A mandatory breeding scheme based on  auscultation and echocardiography findings significantly decreased the prevalence  of MMVD over the 8- to 10-year period. Such a breeding scheme therefore is  recommended for CKCS.","2016-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","63-68","","1","30","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

In humans, NeP is associated with anxiety, depression and reduced quality  of life (QoL). In this study, databases of three specialist veterinary centres  were searched and CKCS breed societies and health forums were contacted to  identify CKCS with an imaging diagnosis of CM/SM. Owners completed questionnaires  on behaviour, signalment, general health status, NeP and QoL. Data were analysed  from 122 dogs out of 564 questionnaires completed, after incomplete  questionnaires and data from dogs that had other potentially debilitating disease  processes were excluded. NeP severity score was significantly and positively  correlated with 'stranger-directed' fear (r(S)=0.28), non-social fear  (r(S)=0.34), 'separation-related' behaviour (r(S)=0.38), attachment behaviour  (r(S)=0.24), excitability (r(S)=0.21) and proxy for pain sensation (r(S)=0.29).  Increased NeP was also significantly associated with decreased QoL (r(S)=0.47),  ability to settle (r(S)=0.26) and willingness to exercise (r(S)=0.50). Severity  of NeP was positively associated with certain fear-associated behaviour and with  decreased owner-perceived QoL. Thus, neurobehavioural changes should be  considered in the management of NeP in CKCS with CM/SM.","2012-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","294-298","","3","194","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ANIMALS: 27 client-owned CKCSs that underwent prebreeding magnetic resonance  imaging screening or investigation of clinical signs consistent with  syringomyelia. PROCEDURES: In dogs with (n = 11) and without (16) magnetic  resonance imaging-confirmed syringomyelia, the median nerve in each thoracic limb  was stimulated and SEPs were recorded over the C1 vertebra; onset latency and  latency and amplitude of the largest negative (N1) and positive (P1) peaks were  measured. The TMMEPs were recorded bilaterally from the extensor carpi radialis  and tibialis cranialis muscles; onset latencies in all 4 limbs were measured.  Bilateral systematic needle EMG examination was performed on the cervical epaxial  musculature, and the number of sites with spontaneous activity was recorded.  RESULTS: In dogs with syringomyelia, amplitudes of N1 and P1 and the amplitude  difference between P1 and N1 were significantly smaller than those recorded for  dogs without syringomyelia (approx 2-fold difference). No difference in SEP  latencies, TMMEP latencies, or the proportion of dogs with > 2 sites of  spontaneous activity detected during EMG examination was detected between groups.  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that SEP amplitude at the  C1 vertebra was a more sensitive measure of spinal cord function in CKCSs with  syringomyelia, compared with results of EMG or TMMEP assessment. Measurement of  SEP amplitude may have use as an objective assessment of the evolution and  treatment of this disease.","2011-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","595-600","","5","72","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21529209","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Pedigree; Prospective Studies; *Evoked Potentials, Motor; *Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Cervical Vertebrae/physiopathology; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/*physiopathology; Electromyography/standards/veterinary; Forelimb/physiopathology; Median Nerve/physiopathology; Spinal Cord/*physiopathology; Syringomyelia/diagnosis/physiopathology/*veterinary; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/standards/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Blood samples  obtained from 41 CKCS [corrected] were analysed by impedance cell counter, laser  cell counter and microscopic estimation. Quantitative buffy coat analysis was  performed only on 17 samples, selected from CKCS [corrected] that had low  platelet counts detected by cell counters. Platelet counts, platelet estimations  and platelet parameters using these different methods were compared. RESULTS: The  median platelet number was lower when estimated using impedance cell counter  (1363x10(9)/I) with respect to laser cell counter (1723x10(9)/I), microscopic  estimation (238x10(9)/I) [corrected] or quantitative buffy coat analyser  (292x10(9)/I) [corrected] (P<0.01). Although impedance cell counter, laser cell  counter and microscopic estimation were positively correlated, there was no  acceptable agreement among methods.

The percentages of CKCS [corrected] with  platelet count < 100x10(9)/I [corrected] were 34.1 per cent (impedance cell  counter), 26.8 per cent (laser cell counter), 22.0 per cent (microscopic  estimation) (not statistically different) and 5.8 per cent (quantitative buffy  coat analyser) (P<0.05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CKCS [corrected] with  macrothrombocytosis have low platelet counts on impedance cell counters, laser  cell counters and microscopic estimation.

In humans, MVP is known to be associated with a low  magnesium status. In this study, the plasma magnesium concentration was measured  in 30 CKCS without heart failure. It was also investigated whether MVP-severity  and degree of regurgitation correlated with plasma magnesium and a number of  parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, and whether 4 weeks magnesium  supplementation affected plasma magnesium or the high renin/low aldosterone  profile associated with MVP. A high prevalence of hypomagnesemia was observed:  plasma concentrations < 0.70 mmol/l were found in 15 dogs (50%) before and in 12  dogs (40%) after 4 weeks magnesium supplementation. The mean plasma level was  0.69 +/- 0.07 mmol/l before and 0.71 +/- 0.07 mmol/l after magnesium (P = 0.22).  Plasma magnesium concentrations did not correlate with MVP-severity and degree of  regurgitation. Plasma aldosterone levels correlated negatively with MVP-severity  and positively with the degree of regurgitation, and serum angiotensin-converting  enzyme activities correlated negatively with the degree of regurgitation.  Magnesium supplementation had no effects on renin and aldosterone nor on the  ratio between the two. In conclusion, many CKCS without heart failure have  hypomagnesemia whether they are fed supplementary magnesium or not--a finding  which may be associated with the high prevalence of MVP in this breed. Further  studies, however, are needed to clarify the role of a low magnesium status in  canine MVP.","1998-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","607-614","","10","45","","Zentralbl Veterinarmed A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 9923143","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Reference Values; Incidence; Dog Diseases/blood/*epidemiology; Magnesium Deficiency/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary; Magnesium/*blood; Mitral Valve Prolapse/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary; Renin-Angiotensin System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Humeral fractures were  recorded and further subclassified as medial, lateral and 'T'/'Y' condylar  fractures. The associations between HCF and subtypes with breed were assessed  using univariate logistic regression with a comparison group. Multivariable  logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of breed while accounting for  dog age, sex and neuter status.

We report here on a new missense  mutation associated with PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds. Coding regions of the  PFKM gene were amplified from genomic DNA and/or cDNA reverse-transcribed from  RNA of EDTA blood of PFK-deficient and clinically healthy Wachtelhunds and  control dogs. The amplicons were sequenced and compared to the published canine  PFKM sequence. A point mutation (c.550C>T, in the coding sequence of PFKM  expressed in blood) was found in all 4 affected Wachtelhunds. This missense  mutation results in an amino acid substitution of arginine (Arg) to tryptophan  (Trp) at position 184 of the protein expressed in blood (p.Arg184Trp). The  mutation is located within an alpha-helix, and based on the SIFT analysis, this  amino acid substitution is not tolerated. Amplifying the region around this  mutation and digesting the PCR fragment with the restriction enzyme MspI,  produces fragments that readily differentiate between PFK-deficient, carrier, and  normal animals. Furthermore, we document 2 additional upstream PFKM exons  expressed in canine testis but not in blood. Despite their similar phenotypic  appearance and use for hunting, Wachtelhunds and English Springer Spaniels are  not thought to have common ancestors. Thus, it is not surprising that different  mutations are responsible for PFK deficiency in these breeds. Knowledge of the  molecular basis of PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds provides an opportunity to  screen and control the spread of this deleterious trait.","2012-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","243-247","","6","26","","Mol Cell Probes","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is associated with  increased R-R interval variability. Little is known about response to  physiological factors and whether iMR is a precursor for developing significant  MR. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of stress testing on the  presence of iMR and heart rate, and short-term (1-2 year) progression of MR in  CKCS with and without iMR. In total, 52 CKCS were included. Substudy 1 enrolled  six dogs with iMR and 11 dogs without iMR. Substudy 2 enrolled 14 dogs with iMR  and 28 dogs without iMR. Substudy 1 prospectively assessed the influence of  stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate. Substudy 2 retrospectively  evaluated short-term progression of iMR. During stress testing, iMR disappeared  in 50% of CKCS and no iMR was recorded at mean heart rates >150 beats/min. Heart  rate response did not differ between CKCS with or without iMR. CKCS with iMR did  not have a higher odds (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-38.2) of  MR progression compared to controls (P = 0.1). In conclusion, physical stress  influenced the occurrence of iMR in CKCS, but heart rate response was not  different from CKCS without iMR. Intermittent mitral regurgitation did not  significantly predict short-term MR progression. In stressed CKCS with early  disease, iMR may be overlooked.","2020-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","105457","","","258","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

ANIMALS STUDIED: Dogs with CASFB  presented to the Animal Health Trust (AHT) from January 2000 to December 2012.  PROCEDURES: Clinical data for CASFB cases were compared to those available for  the remaining AHT ophthalmic population over the same period. The depth of the FB  trauma was divided into five categories. The type of FB and method of removal  were described for each category. The degree of secondary uveitis and lens  involvement was graded and correlated with subsequent enucleation. RESULTS: The  mean age (standard deviation) of 218 identified CASFB cases was 3.96 (2.95)  years. Risk factors for CASFB trauma were dogs younger than 5 years, English  Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and working dogs. Most dogs required  general anesthesia for FB removal, and hypodermic needles were the most commonly  used instrument. The lens was involved in some cases with a full-thickness CASFB  trauma (n = 49, 45%), but most suffered a minor lens trauma (n = 37, 76%). The  lens trauma and phacoclastic uveitis were managed medically in most dogs (n = 37,  76%), and phacoemulsification was only elected as initial treatment in some dogs  (n = 10, 20%). Enucleation was required overall in 6% of dogs. Statistically  significant associations were found between enucleation and depth of FB trauma,  degree of uveitis, and severity of lens trauma (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Young  dogs, English Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and working dogs had an  increased risk of CASFB trauma.

ANIMALS  STUDIED: A total of 45 eyes, 32 normal and 13 glaucomatous eyes, of American  Cocker Spaniels with primary glaucoma were used. All eyes were evaluated through  a complete neuro-ophthalmic examination, tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp  biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy prior to enucleation. METHODS: The  retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was measured in anesthetized animals with  scanning laser polarimetry (Nerve fiber analyzer, GDx; Laser Diagnostic  Technologies, LTD, San Diego, CA, USA). Glaucomatous eyes retained some vision at  the time of this study. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD of the retinal nerve fiber layer  thickness was 141.69 +/- 18 microm for normal dogs and 105.08 +/- 23.86 microm  for visual glaucomatous dogs. The average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in  the superior and inferior retinal quadrants was 148.03 +/- 8.5 and 141.06 +/-  8.73 microm, respectively, for normal dogs, and 106.61 +/- 25.77 and 107.08 +/-  24.99 microm in the superior and inferior retinal quadrants, respectively, for  glaucomatous dogs. The superior to nasal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness  ratio was 1.45 for normal dogs and 1.26 for visual glaucomatous dogs.  CONCLUSIONS: Using scanning laser polarimetry it was possible to detect changes  in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in glaucomatous dogs at early stages of  the disease.

We evaluated a 2-D method for measuring LA and aorta (AO)  in a right parasternal short-axis view and compared it to the M-mode method. An  index for LA size (LA/AO) was calculated in 166 cavalier King Charles spaniels,  56 normal and 110 dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) of varying degrees  secondary to chronic valvular disease. In normal dogs, the AO-2-D and LA/AO-2-D  did not correlate to body weight (BW) or BW2; whereas, all M-mode values and the  LA-2-D were significantly (p < .05) related to both BW parameters. In normal  dogs, there was no difference between M-mode and 2-D indices. For all dogs  (normal and dogs with MR) there was an 11% bias between the M-mode and 2-D index  with the LA/AO-2-D being higher than the LA/AO-M. The association between the  mean and the difference of the indices demonstrated a quadratic relationship.  Dogs with a mean LA/AO of 2.0-2.5 showed the largest difference between the two  indices. Small values for the 2-D coefficients of variation for respiration and  stage of diastole were found; 3.4 and 3.1%, respectively.

Recent research studies  identified brachycephaly and reduced hind cranium as two conformational  (dysmorphic) features that increase risk for symptomatic Chiari-like malformation  and secondary syringomyelia (SM). A prospective pilot study investigated the  hypothesis that dysmorphic head features could be assessed visually and  correlated with risk of SM. Thirteen CKCS, selected from anonymised photographic  evidence, were physically appraised by authorised Kennel Club judges using a head  shape checklist. These subjective evaluations were then matched with objective  measurements of the cranium (cephalic index and rostrocaudal doming) and their  subsequent MRI. A positive correlation (P=0.039) between the judges' checklist  score and rostrocaudal doming (hindskull ratio) and a positive correlation  between the cephalic index and hindskull ratio (P=0.042) were identified. Five  CKCS had no SM and their status tallied with 62 per cent of the judges'  evaluation. Although the ability of adjudicators to identify differences in head  conformation varied, there was sufficient association between the dysmorphic  parameters and the risk of SM to cause concern and propose a larger study in CKCS  breed.","2019-01-26","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","122","","4","184","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","© British Veterinary Association 2019.

Urinary screening tests are  based upon the binding of GAG to dimethylmethylene blue. Alternatively, paper  spot tests using toluidine blue are used in human and veterinary laboratory  medicine. Positive samples undergo GAG isolation for subsequent characterization.  Here, we describe a 3-year-old English Cocker Spaniel with a positive urinary GAG  test, but without other clinical signs of MPS. Urine samples were strongly  positive with the dimethylmethylene blue test, and isolated GAG subjected to  electrophoresis on cellulose acetate revealed a band co-migrating with dermatan  sulfate. However, the isolated GAG were resistant to digestion with  chondroitinase ABC, suggesting that the band did not represent dermatan sulfate.  This was confirmed by mobility of the isolated GAG different from dermatan  sulfate on agarose gel electrophoresis. MPS types VI and VII were excluded by  enzyme assay. To test the hypothesis of a nutritional source, a healthy control  dog was fed the same dog food as the index case. His urine showed a comparable  abnormal GAG screening test and electrophoretic pattern. In addition, the  analysis of an algal supplement present in the administered dog food showed a  similar electrophoretic GAG pattern. The Cocker Spaniel was not available for  further testing after withdrawal of the supplement. Algae contain highly sulfated  fucans and galactans, and it appears that commercial dog food containing such  algal, and possibly other, supplements can give rise to false-positive urinary  MPS screening tests.","2013-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","504-507","","4","42","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology and European Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24320782","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Canine; Diagnosis, Differential; Algal Proteins/administration & dosage; Animal Feed/adverse effects/analysis; Ataxia/diagnosis/urine/veterinary; Dietary Supplements/*adverse effects; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/urine; Electrophoresis/veterinary; False Positive Reactions; Glycosaminoglycans/*urine; hereditary disorders; Methylene Blue/analogs & derivatives; mucopolysaccharides; Mucopolysaccharidoses/diagnosis/urine/*veterinary; urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complete ophthalmic  examination revealed moderate OS exophthalmos and lateral globe deviation. No  other abnormalities were noted on physical or ophthalmic examination, ocular  ultrasound, complete bloodwork, or thoracic radiography. Skull computed  tomography (CT) revealed a large, focal, smoothly irregular, cavitated, expansile  bony lesion involving the left caudal maxillary and left frontal bones. Biopsies,  obtained through a frontal sinusotomy approach to preserve the left globe  integrity, demonstrated normal reactive trabecular bone with locally extensive  fibrosis. Calvarial hyperostosis was diagnosed based upon appearance on imaging,  lesion unilaterality, absence of mandibular involvement, and histopathology. Six  months after initial presentation, skull CT was repeated and marked reduction in  the degree of frontal bone thickening was demonstrated with complete resolution  of cavitations. There was marked clinical improvement with mild, nonpainful  exophthalmos, and lateral globe deviation OS on ophthalmic examination. Eleven  months after initial presentation, there was complete resolution of the frontal  bone lesion with mild thickening of the left calvarial bones on repeat skull CT.

We have identified a canine model for profound exercise intolerance  caused by a deficit in PDP1 (EC 3.1.3.43), the phosphatase enzyme that activates  the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc). The Clumber spaniel breed was  originated in 1760 by the Duc de Noailles, as a hunting dog with a gentle  temperament suitable for the 'elderly gentleman'. Here we report that 20% of the  current Clumber and Sussex spaniel population are carriers for a null mutation in  PDP1, and that homozygosity produces severe exercise intolerance. Human pyruvate  dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency was recently characterized at the molecular  level. However, the nature of the human mutation (loss of a single amino acid  altering PDP1 activity) made it impossible to discern the role of the second  phosphatase isoform, PDP2, in the deficient phenotype. Here we show that the null  mutation in dogs provides a valuable animal model with which to study the effects  of dysregulation of the PDHc. Knowledge of the molecular defect has allowed for  the institution of a rapid restriction enzyme test for the canine mutation that  will allow for selective breeding and has led to a suggested dietary therapy for  affected dogs that has proven to be beneficial. Pharmacological and genetic  therapies for PDP1 deficiency can now be investigated and the role of PDP2 can be  fully characterized.","2007-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","15-23","","1","90","","Mol Genet Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17095275","","","","Animals; Humans; Female; Male; Pedigree; *Dogs; Disease Models, Animal; Point Mutation; Cells, Cultured; Isoenzymes/*deficiency/genetics; Physical Conditioning, Animal/physiology; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)-Phosphatase/*deficiency/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  enzyme consists of two catalytic alpha and beta subunits, two identical  inhibitory gamma subunits as well as a delta subunit. Mutations in PDE6A and the  PDE6B genes lead to autosomal recessive (ar) forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP)  in human and to the homologous disease in dogs, designated generalised  progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA). We investigated the PDE6A gene in 13  gPRA-affected dog breeds including healthy animals, obligate gPRA carriers and  gPRA-affected dogs. In the coding region of PDE6A only a rare sequence variation  (G103A; Asp35Asn) was found in exon 1 of two healthy Tibet Terriers and one  affected Cocker Spaniel. Using single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)  analyses we detected several sequence variations in eight of the PDE6A introns in  different investigated breeds. Most informative for excluding the PDE6A gene as a  cause for gPRA was a polymorphic microsatellite ((GT)10CG(GT)2CG(GT)12) in intron  14 and four sequence variations in intron 18 for almost all breeds investigated.  The sequence variations of PDE6A did not segregate together with gPRA in 11  breeds. Since diseased animals were heterozygous for the polymorphisms, the PDE6A  gene is unlikely to harbour the critical mutation causing gPRA in the following  breeds: Chesapeake Bay Retriever.

Over a 3-year interval,  the dog underwent 3 computed tomography (CT) and 1 magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) examinations. A voluminous hyperattenuating lesion with a mass effect,  exhibiting weak postcontrast enhancement and associated with surrounding diffuse  parenchymal hypoattenuation, was observed in the first CT examination (3 d after  initial clinical signs). The second CT examination (11 d later) revealed a  hypoattenuating lesion with ring postcontrast enhancement. A clear reduction of  the size of the mass, which presented as hyperattenuating with a severely  postcontrast-enhanced center, was noted in the third CT examination (2.5 y after  initial clinical signs and 3 mo after onset of seizures).

CLINICAL FINDINGS  Otoscopic examination of the left ear revealed evidence of chronic inflammation;  the ear was flushed with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Examination of the  right ear revealed more severe chronic inflammation than in the left ear,  including a ruptured tympanum (timing of rupture unknown). The right ear was  flushed with sterile saline solution, and several drops of otic medication were  instilled. During infusion of saline solution, the ECG revealed a rapid decrease  in heart rate until no more electrical activity was noted. Pulse also ceased to  be detectable via pulse oximetry and femoral artery palpation. TREATMENT AND  OUTCOME Isoflurane was discontinued immediately after recognition of cardiac  arrest. Shortly after, atropine (0.04 mg/kg [0.02 mg/lb]) and epinephrine (0.3  mg/kg [0.14 mg/lb]) were administered IV, chest compressions and ventilation were  performed for 2 to 3 minutes, and 3 boluses (each 5 mL/kg) of lactated Ringer  solution were administered IV. The dog was extubated 8 minutes after anesthesia  was discontinued, and its recovery was monitored for the next 5 hours. No further  incidents of cardiac arrest occurred after recovery from anesthesia. CLINICAL  RELEVANCE This case represented a rarely documented potential complication  associated with otic manipulation in a dog: cardiac arrest secondary to  stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Veterinarians should be  prepared for and warn clients of this possibility prior to otic flushing.","2017-05-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1023-1026","","9","250","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28414607","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Diagnosis, Differential; Electrocardiography/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/therapy; Ear, Inner; Heart Arrest/diagnosis/*veterinary; Otitis Media/therapy/*veterinary; Resuscitation/veterinary; Sodium Chloride/*administration & dosage; Vagus Nerve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diagnosis of PSOM has been made based  only on visualization of a bulging tympanic membrane and mucus in the middle ear  post-myringotomy. No additional tests have been evaluated for the diagnosis of  PSOM; CKCSs with early disease may have been missed. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The  objective of this study was to compare otoscopy, tympanometry, pneumotoscopy and  tympanic bulla ultrasonography, using computed tomography (CT) as the gold  standard for the diagnosis of PSOM in the CKCS. ANIMALS: Sixty CKCSs with  clinical signs suggestive of PSOM. METHODS: Otoscopy, CT scan, tympanic bulla  ultrasonography, tympanometry and pneumotoscopy were performed; those CKCSs with  a soft tissue density in the middle ear identified on CT had a myringotomy and  middle ear flush. RESULTS: Forty-three (72%) CKCSs had PSOM (30 bilateral, 13  unilateral). A large bulging pars flaccida was identified in only those CKCS with  PSOM (specificity of 100%); however, only 21 of 73 ears with PSOM had a large  bulging pars flaccida (sensitivity of 29%). Sensitivity and specificity for  tympanometry, pneumotoscopy and tympanic bulla ultrasonography were (84%, 47%),  (75%, 79%) and (67%, 47%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:  Based on these results a large bulging pars flaccida indicates the presence of  PSOM, whereas a flat pars flaccida may be present in CKCS that have PSOM as well  as those that do not. In CKCSs with a flat pars flaccida none of the above  diagnostic tests can be recommended in place of CT scan for the diagnosis of  PSOM.","2015-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","459-66, e106-107","","6","26","","Vet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 ESVD and ACVD.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26265219","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Ultrasonography; Sensitivity and Specificity; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Acoustic Impedance Tests/veterinary; Otitis Media/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary; Otoscopy/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These images are static and the positioning of the dogs'  head does not reflect the physiological in vivo position of the craniocervical  junction (CCJ). Aberrant motion patterns and ranges of motion (ROM) in sound  individuals of CCJA predisposed breeds may be a pathogenetic trigger. To further  extend our limited knowledge of physiological motion of the CCJ, this  prospective, comparative study investigates the in vivo motion patterns and ROM  of the CCJ in walk and trot in sound Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and  Chihuahuas. The Labrador retriever is used as a reference breed without  predisposition for CCJA. This is the first detailed description of CCJ movement  of trotting dogs. Biplanar fluoroscopy images, recorded in walking and trotting  dogs, were matched to a virtual reconstruction of the skull and cranial cervical  spine utilising Scientific Rotoscoping. Kinematic data reveal the same motion  patterns among all breeds and gaits with individual temporal and spatial  differences in each dog. A stride cycle-dependent lateral rotation of the cranial  cervical spine and axial rotation of the atlantoaxial joint in trot in dogs is  described for the first time. The ROM of the atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital  joints in walk and trot were not statistically significantly greater in the  CCJA-predisposed breeds CKCS and Chihuahua. ROM values of all translational and  rotational degrees of freedom were larger in walk than trot, although this is  only statistically significant for the atlantoaxial joint. Until proven  otherwise, a more species-specific than breed-specific general motion pattern of  the CCJ in walking and trotting, clinically sound dogs must be assumed.  Species-specific anatomic properties of the CCJ seem to supersede breed-specific  anatomical differences in clinically sound dogs.","2023","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0278665","","1","18","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2023 Nickel et al.

The current imaging modality to screen CKCS for CM/SM is MRI of the brain and  cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging provides good soft tissue detail and  contrast of the cerebellum and cervical spinal cord. Computed tomography (CT) is  another cross-sectional imaging technique that facilitates brain and neck  evaluation; however, soft tissue resolution does not match that of MRI. Computed  tomography benefits include identification of concurrent craniocervical junction  anomalies (atlantooccipital overlap) and shorter imaging/anesthesia times with  the ability to use only sedation. The aim of this retrospective, method  comparison study is to assess the utility of multidetector CT for screening CM  and SM in CKCS as compared to high-field MRI. Three groups of observers with  different levels of experience graded CM and SM based on the British Veterinary  Association/Kennel Club CM/SM classification criteria. Thirty CKCS underwent  multidetector CT and 3 Tesla MRI studies. Computed tomography and MRI studies  were reviewed at different timepoints to minimize bias. Computed tomography has  lower Cohen's Kappa agreement for each observer group compared to MRI. The  intraclass correlation coefficient averaging CM and SM for all groups was  excellent using MRI, while CT was poor for SM and moderate for cerebellar  herniation. Greater observer experience resulted in a higher agreement for CT and  MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging should remain the standard for screening of CM  and SM as CT can result in misclassification and greater disagreement.","2020-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","444-452","","4","61","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 American College of Veterinary Radiology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32329949","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging; CKCS; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods/*veterinary; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Encephalocele/pathology/veterinary; BVA; caudal occipital malformation syndrome; Cerebellum/pathology; Multidetector Computed Tomography/methods/*veterinary; syringohydromyelia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this study were to i) compare cerebellar  volume in CKCS (a ""high risk' group which frequently develops CM/SM), small breed  dogs (medium risk--occasionally develop CM/SM), and Labradors (low risk--CM/SM  not reported); ii) evaluate a possible association between increased cerebellar  volume and CM/SM in CKCS; iii) investigate the relationship between increased  cerebellar volume and crowding of the cerebellum in the caudal part of the CCF  (i.e. the region of the foramen magnum). Volumes of three-dimensional, magnetic  resonance imaging derived models of the CCF and cerebellum were obtained from 75  CKCS, 44 small breed dogs, and 31 Labradors. As SM is thought to be a late onset  disease process, two subgroups were formed for comparison: 18 CKCS younger than 2  years with SM (CM/SM group) and 13 CKCS older than 5 years without SM (CM group).  Relative cerebellar volume was defined as the volume of the cerebellum divided by  the total volume of brain parenchyma. Our results show that the CKCS has a  relatively larger cerebellum than small breed dogs and Labradors and provide  evidence that increased cerebellar volume in CKCS is associated with crowding of  cerebellum in the caudal part of the CCF. In CKCS there is an association between  increased cerebellar volume and SM. These findings have implications for the  understanding of the pathological mechanisms of CM/SM, and support the hypothesis  that it is a multifactorial disease process governed by increased cerebellar  volume and failure of the CCF to reach a commensurate size.","2012","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e33660","","4","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22506005  PMCID: PMC3323625","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Syringomyelia/pathology/*veterinary; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/pathology/*veterinary; Cerebellum/*pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  ability of ECS with RPED to absorb orally administered vitamin E and establish a  basis for vitamin E supplementation in affected dogs. ANIMALS STUDIED: 8  RPED-affected ECS and five clinically normal dogs. PROCEDURES: An oral vitamin E  tolerance test (OVETT) was conducted in each dog. Blood samples were obtained  prior to and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 120, and 240 h following oral administration of  90 iu/kg of RRR-α-tocopherol. Plasma alpha tocopherol (αTOC) content was measured  by normal phase, high-performance liquid chromatography, and indices of vitamin E  absorption calculated. RESULTS: There was marked variation in OVETT results  between individuals. In RPED-affected ECS, mean peak plasma αTOC concentration  (17.87 ± 13.21 μg/mL), attained after administration of a large oral dose of the  vitamin, was significantly lower than the mean peak plasma αTOC concentration  attained in normal dogs (47.61 ± 17.17 μg/mL; P < 0.005). However, the plasma  concentrations achieved in 7/8 RPED-affected dogs remained within the normal  reference range for plasma αTOC in vitamin E-replete dogs, for at least 12 h  postdose. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E-deficient ECS with RPED are capable of absorbing  orally administered vitamin E. Twice daily administration of 600-900 iu  tocopherol is likely to restore plasma vitamin E concentrations to the normal  range in most affected dogs.","2012-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","48-56","","","15 Suppl 2","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22831287","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Area Under Curve; Administration, Oral; Absorption; Dog Diseases/blood/*metabolism; Retinal Detachment/genetics/metabolism/*veterinary; Vitamin E Deficiency/drug therapy/genetics/*veterinary; Vitamin E/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known regarding platelet, plasma, valvular, or  myocardial 5HT concentration ([5HT]) in affected dogs. We quantified [5HT] in  platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), mitral valve leaflets  (MV), and left ventricular myocardium (LV). ANIMALS: Forty-five dogs comprised 4  plasma groups of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) or non-CKCS, either  healthy (CON) or MMVD affected: CKCS CON (n = 12); non-CKCS CON (n = 8); CKCS  MMVD (n = 14); non-CKCS MMVD (n = 11). Twenty-four dogs comprised 3 tissue  groups: MMVD (n = 8); other-HD (heart disease) (n = 7); non-HD, extracardiac  disease (n = 9). METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography measured PRP,  PPP, MV, and LV [5HT]. RESULTS: Platelet-rich plasma platelet [5HT] was greater  in CKCS CON (1.83 femtograms/platelet [fg/plt]; range, 0.20-4.76; P = .002), CKCS  MMVD (1.58 fg/plt; range, 0.70-4.03; P = .005), and non-CKCS MMVD (1.72 fg/plt;  range, 0.85-4.44; P = .003) versus non-CKCS CON (0.92 fg/plt; range, 0.63-1.30).  There was no group difference in PPP [5HT]. MV [5HT] was significantly higher in  MMVD (32.4 ng/mg; range, 8.4-106.7) versus non-HD (3.6 ng/mg; range, 0-28.3; P =  .01) and LV [5HT] was significantly higher in MMVD (11.9 ng/mg; range, 4.0-104.8)  versus other-HD (0.9 ng/mg; range, 0-10.1; P = .011) and non-HD (2.5 ng/mg;  range, 0-6.9; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Platelet [5HT] was  highest in healthy CKCS and both MMVD groups, but plasma [5HT] showed no group  differences. Tissue [5HT] was highest in MV and LV of MMVD-affected dogs,  suggesting altered 5HT signaling as a potential feature of MMVD. Interactions of  platelet, valvular, and myocardial 5HT signaling warrant further investigation.","2014-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1534-1540","","5","28","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25146933  PMCID: PMC4895588","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; Myxomatous mitral valve disease; Platelet Count/veterinary; 5-Hydroxytryptamine; Blood Platelets/chemistry; Dog Diseases/*blood/metabolism; Heart disease; Heart Valve Diseases/blood/metabolism/*veterinary; Heart Ventricles/*chemistry; Mitral Valve/*chemistry; Serotonin/*analysis/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Epidural venous distention during raised intrathoracic pressure (Valsalva) may cause impulsive movement of  fluid (""slosh"") within the syrinx. Such a slosh mechanism is a proposed cause of  syrinx dissection into spinal cord parenchyma resulting in craniocaudal  propagation of the cavity. We sought to test the ""slosh"" hypothesis by epidural  excitation of CSF pulse in a computer model of canine syringomyelia. Our  previously developed canine syringomyelia computer model was modified to include  an epidural pressure pulse. Simulations were run for: cord free of cavities; cord  with small syringes at different locations; and cord with a syrinx that was  progressively expanding caudally. If small syringes are present, there are peaks  of stress at those locations. This effect is most pronounced at the locations at  which syringes initially form. When a syrinx is expanding caudally, the peak  stress is typically at the caudal end of the syrinx. However, when the syrinx  reaches the lumbar region; the stress becomes moderate. The findings support the  ""slosh"" hypothesis, suggesting that small cervical syringes may propagate  caudally. However, when the syrinx is large, there is less focal stress, which  may explain why a syrinx can rapidly expand but then remain unchanged in shape  over years.","2021-10-14","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","10","11","","Life (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 34685454  PMCID: PMC8541149","","","","cavalier King Charles spaniel; Chiari malformation; Bernard Williams hypothesis; biomechanics; cerebrospinal fluid; pathophysiology syringomyelia; Valsalva maneuver","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neurological examination was suggestive of a lesion localized to the L4-S3 spinal  cord segments. No abnormalities were seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  performed in the dog in dorsal recumbency and the hips in a neutral position and  the conus medullaris ended halfway the vertebral body of L7. An MRI of the hips  in extended and flexed positions demonstrated minimal displacement of the conus  medullaris in the cranial and caudal directions, respectively. Similar to the  images in neutral position, the conus medullaris ended halfway the vertebral body  of L7 in both the extended and flexed positions. In comparison, an MRI of the  hips in neutral, extended, and flexed positions performed in another English  Cocker Spaniel revealed obvious cranial displacement of the conus medullaris with  the hips in extension and caudal displacement with hips in flexion. A standard  dorsal lumbosacral laminectomy was performed. Visual inspection of the vertebral  canal revealed excessive caudal traction on the conus medullaris. After  sectioning the distal aspect of the filum terminale, the conus medullaris  regained a more cranial position. A neurological examination 4 weeks after  surgery revealed clinical improvement. Neurological examinations at 2, 4, 7, and  12 months after surgery did not reveal any abnormalities, and the dog was  considered to be clinically normal. Tethered cord syndrome with a tight filum  terminale is a very rare congenital anomaly and is characterized by an abnormally  short and inelastic filum terminale. Therefore, this disorder is associated with  abnormal caudal traction on the spinal cord and decreased physiological  craniocaudal movements of the neural structures within the vertebral canal.  Although further studies are necessary to evaluate and quantify physiological  craniocaudal movement of the spinal cord and conus medullaris in neurologically  normal dogs, the results of this report suggest further exploration of dynamic  MRI to demonstrate decreased craniocaudal displacement of the conus medullaris in  dogs with tethered cord syndrome with a tight filum terminale.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","134","","","4","","Front Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 28868301  PMCID: PMC5563312","","","","conus medullaris; cauda equina; magnetic resonance imaging; spinal dysraphism; spinal malformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MVD has different severity levels, and there  are many practical limitations in identifying its asymptomatic stages. Proteomic  techniques are valuable for studying the proteins and peptides involved in  cardiovascular diseases, including the period prior to the clinical onset of the  disease. The aim of this study was to identify the serum proteins that were  differentially expressed in healthy CKCS and those affected by MVD in mild to  severe stages. Proteomics analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel  electrophoresis separation and a bioinformatics analysis for the detection of  differentially expressed spots. In a comparative analysis, protein spots with a  p < 0.05 (ANOVA) were considered statistically significant and were excised from  the gels for analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS for protein identification. RESULTS: Eight  proteins resulted differentially expressed among the groups and significantly  related to the progression of the disease. In mild affected group versus healthy  dogs complement factor H isoform 2, inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, hemopexin,  dystrobrevin beta isoform X7 and CD5 molecule-like resulted to be down-regulated,  whereas fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 3A isoform X4 was  up-regulated. In severe affected dogs versus healthy group complement factor H  isoform 2, calpain-3 isoform X2, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7, CD5 molecule-like  and l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase resulted to be down-regulated. Complement  factor H isoform 2, calpain-3 isoform X2, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7, CD5  molecule-like and hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase were found to be down-regulated  in mild affected group versus healthy dogs. All of these proteins except  complement factor H followed a decreasing trend according to the progression of  the pathology. CONCLUSION: The differential expression of serum proteins  demonstrates the possibility these might be valuable for the detection and  monitoring of the disease. Further longitudinal studies are required to determine  whether differential protein expression occurs sufficiently early in the  progression of the disease and with sufficient predictive value to allow  proteomics analysis to be used as an early detection and on-line diagnostic tool.","2017-02-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","43","","1","13","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28173805  PMCID: PMC5297119","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Case-Control Studies; Cavalier King Charles Spaniel; Dog; Proteomics; *Proteome; Blood Proteins/analysis; Dog Diseases/*blood/diagnosis; Heart Valve Diseases/blood/diagnosis/*veterinary; Mitral valve disease; Mitral Valve/pathology; Proteomic analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pulmonary  embolization of the device is a rarely reported complication of this procedure.  We report here the first two cases of successful transcatheter retrieval of an  embolized ACDO. An 8-month-old, 21-kg, German shepherd (case 1) was referred for  pulmonary edema secondary to a large PDA with left-to-right shunting. After  medical stabilization, an emergency procedure for PDA closure was recommended. An  8-mm ACDO was deployed under general anesthesia. The device was released after  confirming its stability with a gentle tug test but migrated into the pulmonary  trunk. A 10-mm ACDO was subsequently successfully deployed and released. Vascular  access was then obtained from the right jugular vein so that a vascular snare  could be used to capture the ACDO waist and pull it back toward the right  ventricle and then the right atrium. It was then removed through the jugular  vein. The dog recovered uneventfully and was discharged after confirmation of  complete ductal occlusion. The same complication occurred in a second case (case  2, asymptomatic 6-month-old, 7.9-kg, cocker spaniel), and a similar procedure was  used to successfully retrieve the embolized device. Both dogs are still doing  well 9 and 21 months, respectively, after the procedure. These cases illustrate  that transcatheter retrieval of ACDO devices embolized in the pulmonary artery  using vascular snares is technically feasible in the dog.","2018-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","451-457","","6","20","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018.

This study aimed to assess  the functional impact of P2X7 variation in a random sample of the canine  population. Blood and genomic DNA were obtained from 69 dogs selected as  representatives of a cross section of different breeds. P2X7 function was  determined by flow cytometric measurements of dye uptake and patch-clamp  measurements of inward currents. P2X7 expression was determined by immunoblotting  and immunocytochemistry. Sequencing was used to identify P2RX7 gene  polymorphisms. P2X7 was cloned from an English springer spaniel, and point  mutations were introduced into this receptor by site-directed mutagenesis. The  relative function of P2X7 on monocytes varied between individual dogs. The canine  P2RX7 gene encoded four missense polymorphisms: F103L and P452S, found in  heterozygous and homozygous dosage, and R270C and R365Q, found only in  heterozygous dosage. Moreover, R270C and R365Q were associated with the cocker  spaniel and Labrador retriever, respectively. F103L, R270C, and R365Q but not  P452S corresponded to decreased P2X7 function in monocytes but did not explain  the majority of differences in P2X7 function between dogs, indicating that other  factors contribute to this variability. Heterologous expression of site-directed  mutants of P2X7 in human embryonic kidney-293 cells indicated that the R270C  mutant was nonfunctional, the F103L and R365Q mutants had partly reduced  function, and the P452S mutant functioned normally.

There are limited data on the mitral  valve transcriptome and the aim of this study was to use the microarray  technology in conjunction with bioinformatics platforms to analyse transcript  changes in MMVD in CKCS compared to normal dogs (non-CKCS). Differentially  expressed genes (n = 5397) were identified using cut-off settings of fold change,  false discovery rate (FDR) and P <0.05. In total, 4002 genes were annotated to a  specific transcript in the Affymetrix canine database, and after further  filtering, 591 annotated canine genes were identified: 322 (55%) were  up-regulated and 269 (45%) were down-regulated. Canine microRNAs (cfa-miR;  n = 59) were also identified. Gene ontology and network analysis platforms  identified between six and 10 significantly different biological function  clusters from which the following were selected as relevant to MMVD:  inflammation, cell movement, cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix  organisation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Ingenuity Pathway  Analysis identified three canonical pathways relevant to MMVD: caveolar-mediated  endocytosis, remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions, and endothelin-1  signalling. Considering the biological relevance to MMVD, the gene families of  importance with significant difference between groups included collagens, ADAMTS  peptidases, proteoglycans, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors,  basement membrane components, cathepsin S, integrins, tight junction cell  adhesion proteins, cadherins, other matrix-associated proteins, and members of  the serotonin (5-HT)/transforming growth factor -β signalling pathway.","2015-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","23-31","","1","204","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

M.","Genetics of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease.","Animal genetics","","1365-2052 0268-9146","10.1111/age.13082","","Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease and cause of cardiac death in domestic dogs. MMVD is characterised by slow progressive  myxomatous degeneration from the tips of the mitral valves onwards with  subsequent mitral valve regurgitation, and left atrial and ventricular  dilatation. Although the disease usually has a long asymptomatic period, in dogs  with severe disease, mortality is typically secondary to left-sided congestive  heart failure. Although it is not uncommon for dogs to survive long enough in the  asymptomatic period to die from unrelated causes; a proportion of dogs rapidly  advance into congestive heart failure. Heightened prevalence in certain breeds,  such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, has indicated that MMVD is under a  genetic influence. The genetic characterisation of the factors that underlie the  difference in progression of disease is of strong interest to those concerned  with dog longevity and welfare. Advanced genomic technologies have the potential  to provide information that may impact treatment, prevalence, or severity of MMVD  through the elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms and the detection of  predisposing genetic loci of major effect. Here we describe briefly the clinical  nature of the disorder and consider the physiological mechanisms that might  impact its occurrence in the domestic dog.

The high-throughput sequencing using  454-Roche Titanium sequencer generated about 2.16 Giga bases of raw data.  Initially, we have successfully identified 25,619 single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) that passed the stringent SNP calling parameters. Further, we performed  association study on the cohort, and the highly significant (0.001) associations  were short-listed and investigated in-depth. Out of the 171 significant SNPs, 113  were previously unreported. Interestingly, six among them were non-synonymous  coding (NSC) SNPs, which includes CPPED1 A>G (p.M307V), PITRM1 T>G (p.S715A), APP  G>A (p.T266M), RNF213 A>G (p.V1482A), C>A (p.V1456L), and SLC46A3 G>A (p.R168Q).  On the other hand, 35 out of 113 unreported SNPs were falling in regulatory  regions such as 3'-UTR, 5'-UTR, etc. In-depth bioinformatics analysis revealed  that majority of NSC SNPs have damaging effect and alter protein stability. This  study highlighted the genetic markers associated with PRA, which will help to  develop genetic assay-based screening in effective breeding.","2015-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","638-649","","11-12","26","","Mamm Genome","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26515695","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Case-Control Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Amino Acid Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; *Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; *Exome; Retinal Degeneration/genetics/*veterinary; Conserved Sequence; Mutation, Missense","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Information was obtained  from the Veterinary Medical Data Base (VMDB) from all veterinary medical teaching  hospitals in North America from March 1964 to March 2003. Secondary glaucomas  were diagnosed at the same examination or after the primary diagnosis was made,  and included those associated with cataract formation, lens luxation, cataract  surgery, uveitis of unknown cause, hyphema of unknown cause, and intraocular  neoplasia. The data were evaluated by decade, breed, gender and age of  presentation. RESULTS: A total of 1 592 831 dogs were presented, and 9695 canine  secondary glaucomas. Secondary glaucoma associated with cataract formation  represented 81% of all the canine secondary glaucomas. Breeds (n = 7890 dogs)  predisposed to secondary glaucoma and cataracts had an overall prevalence of  0.5%, but nearly 20% of all the cataractous dogs developed secondary glaucoma in  at least one eye. For the years 1994-2003, these breeds included the American  Cocker Spaniel; Boston Terrier; Toy, Miniature and Standard Poodle; English  Springer Spaniel; Bichon Frise; and Labrador Retriever. The other forms of  secondary glaucoma occurred less frequently, and included those glaucomas with  lens luxation or displacement (779 dogs; 12.0%), postcataract surgery (528 dogs;  5.1%), with uveitis from unknown cause (399 dogs; 7.1%), with hyphema from  unknown cause (117 dogs; 7.3%), and with intraocular neoplasia (19 dogs; 3.5%).  The risk of the secondary glaucomas from 1984 to 2002 was highest after the  intracapsular lens extraction (ICLE), less in the extracapsular technique (ECLE),  and lowest for the phacoemulsification/phacofragmentation method. CONCLUSION:  Prevalence of the canine secondary glaucomas ranges from 0.25% (1964-1973), 0.46%  (1974-1983), 0.79% (1984-1993), to 0.80% (1994-2003) and are as frequent as the  primary or breed-related glaucomas during these same time periods.","2004-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","245-259","","4","7","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15200621","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Prevalence; Pedigree; Records/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology; United States/epidemiology; Glaucoma/epidemiology/*veterinary; Cataract/complications/veterinary; Eye Neoplasms/complications/veterinary; Lens Subluxation/complications/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PACG in most of canine breeds is epidemiologically  similar to humans with older and female patients overrepresented with the  condition. The American Cocker Spaniel (ACS) is among the most common breeds  observed with PACG development in dogs. This study initially sought to identify  genetic risk factors to explain the high prevalence of PACG in ACSs by using a  case-control breed-matched genome-wide association study. However, the GWAS  failed to identify candidate loci associated with PACG in this breed. This study  then assessed intrinsic ocular morphologic traits that may relate to PACG  susceptibility in this breed. Normal ACSs without glaucoma have a crowded  anterior ocular segment and narrow iridocorneal angle and ciliary cleft, which is  consistent with anatomical risk factors identified in humans. The ACSs showed  unique features consisting of posterior bowing of iris and longer iridolenticular  contact, which mirrors reverse pupillary block and pigment dispersion syndrome in  humans. The ACS could hold potential to serve as an animal model of naturally  occurring PACG in humans.","2022-11-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","18980","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

HYPOTHESIS: That  progression of mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with development of  endothelial dysfunction. ANIMALS: Forty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  (CKCS) with MR of varying severity. METHODS: Privately owned CKCS were  prospectively recruited and divided in 4 groups: (1) 12 CKCS with minimal MR; (2)  9 CKCS with mild MR; (3) 11 CKCS with moderate-severe MR; and (4) 11 CKCS with  moderate-severe MR and clinical signs compatible with heart failure. Dogs  underwent blood sampling, echocardiography, blood pressure (BP) recordings, and  flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) measurements. The effect of progressive MR on  FMD was determined by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Flow-mediated vasodilation  decreased with progression of MR. Group 4 (4.79 ± 3.22%) had significantly lower  FMD than groups 1 (10.40 ± 4.58%) and 2 (10.14 ± 3.67%) (P < .005) and group 3  (6.79 ± 3.98%) had a significantly lower FMD than group 1 (P = .03).

METHODS: VHS was measured at intervals before CHF. ∆VHS/month was calculated from  sequential pairs of VHS measurements and the interval between them. Diagnostic  accuracy and utility were determined by the areas under receiver operating  characteristic plots (AUROC), and likelihood ratios (LR). RESULTS: AUROC for VHS  at the onset of CHF was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.96-0.90), to predict CHF 1-12 months  before CHF was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.81-0.66), and for ∆VHS/month at CHF was 0.98 (95%  CI, 0.99-0.96).

Abnormal valvular stress is thought to contribute to the development and  progression of MMVD, and a relationship exists between mitral valve (MV)  morphology and stress acting on the valve. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the  MV morphology of healthy adult CKCSs differs from the morphology of healthy adult  dogs of other breeds determined by RT-3DTTE. ANIMALS: Thirty-five healthy CKCSs  and 41 healthy dogs of other breeds. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study.  Dogs underwent physical examination, conventional echocardiography, and RT-3DTTE.  RT-3DTTE datasets were analyzed using dedicated software for MV morphologic  analysis. Morphologic variables were compared between CKCSs and dogs of other  breeds. RESULTS: The MV of healthy CKCSs had a smaller annulus height (0.46 ±  0.11 vs. 0.56 ± 0.17; P = .0021), tenting height (0.26 ± 0.12 vs. 0.42 ± 0.18; P  < .001), tenting area (0.42 ± 0.15 vs. 0.79 ± 0.34; P < .001), normalized tenting  volume (0.09 [0.05-0.13] vs. 0.14 [0.10-0.20]; P < .001), and normalized area of  the posterior leaflet (0.57 ± 0.15 vs. 0.66 ± 0.18; P = .016) compared to healthy  dogs of other breeds; this results in CKCSs having a flatter MV with reduced  tenting, compared to the MV of other breeds.

Using developed trend analysis  applied on interdaily stability parameter, we achieved sensitivity and  specificity about 65, resp. 68.

The  objective of this prospective reference interval study was to provide  breed-specific echocardiographic values for healthy French Bulldogs. A total of  42 healthy French Bulldogs of both sexes (23 females and 19 males) were sampled.  Furthermore, measurements for a control group (n = 16) were also conducted in  four other dog breeds (Cocker Spaniel [n = 2], Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  [n = 4], Terrier [n = 5], and Crossbreed [n = 5]). Standard M-mode,  two-dimensional (2D), pulse wave (PW) Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)  echocardiographic measurements were obtained from healthy French Bulldogs. The  M-mode echocardiographic data obtained from French Bulldogs were compared to the  data obtained from the control group. The left ventricular internal dimension at  end-diastole (LVIDd; cm)/body surface area (BSA) (m(2) ) ratio for the study  group was 3.35/0.53 = 6.32. Left ventricular measurements for French bulldogs and  internal dimension at end-systole (21.23 ± 3.50 mm) and at end-diastole (33.50 ±  4.12 mm) were found to be significantly higher (P < .001) compared to control  group values (left ventricular internal dimension at end-systole [LVIDs]; 17.46 ±  2.85 mm, LVIDd; 27.16 ± 4.20 mm, respectively). A significantly positive  correlation in the French Bulldog group was noted between body weight and M-mode  measurements (EPSS, IVSd, IVSs, LVIDd, LVIDs, and LVPWd). French bulldogs had a  greater systolic and diastolic left ventricular volume than the control group. As  a result, values reported in this study could be used as specific reference  ranges in French Bulldogs.","2021-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","573-582","","5","62","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 American College of Veterinary Radiology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34109689","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; dog; Prospective Studies; Reference Values; Body Weight; Heart Rate; *Echocardiography/veterinary; echocardiographic; pulsed wave Doppler; tissue Doppler imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated one breeder's 25 Basset Hounds for these  infections. In addition, tissues from dogs and other non-canine hosts previously  reported as S. canis infections were studied retrospectively. Schizonts  resembling those of S. neurona, and recognized by polyclonal rabbit anti-S.  neurona antibodies, were found in six of eight retrospective cases, as well as in  two additional dogs (one Basset Hound, one Springer Spaniel) not previously  reported. S. neurona schizonts were found in several tissues including the  central nervous system, lungs, and kidneys. Fatal toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in  an adult dog, and neosporosis was diagnosed in an adult and a pup related to the  one diagnosed with S. neurona. No serological reactivity to S. neurona antibodies  occurred when S. canis-like liver schizonts were retrospectively assayed from two  dogs, a dolphin, a sea lion, a horse, a chinchilla, a black or either of two  polar bears. Sequencing conserved (18S) and variable (ITS-1) portions of nuclear  ribosomal DNA isolated from the schizont-laden liver of a polar bear  distinguished it from all previously characterized species of Sarcocystis. We  take this genetic signature as provisionally representative of S. canis, an  assumption that should be tested with future sequencing of similar liver  infections in other mammalian hosts. These findings further extend the  uncharacteristically broad intermediate host range for S. neurona, which also  causes a neurologic disease in cats, mink, raccoons, skunks, Pacific harbor  seals, ponies, zebras, lynxes, and sea otters. Further work is necessary to  delineate the causative agent(s) of other cases of canine sarcocystosis, and in  particular to specify the attributes of S. canis, which corresponds  morphologically to infections reported from wide range of terrestrial and marine  mammals.","2006-04-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","36-49","","1-2","137","","Vet Parasitol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 16458431","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/veterinary; *Neospora/classification/immunology; Agglutination Tests/methods/veterinary; Antibodies, Protozoan/blood; Coccidiosis/parasitology/pathology/*veterinary; DNA, Protozoan/analysis; Dog Diseases/parasitology/*pathology; Phylogeny; Sarcocystis/classification/immunology; Sarcocystosis/parasitology/pathology/*veterinary; Toxoplasma/classification/immunology; Toxoplasmosis, Animal/parasitology/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aimed to investigate prevalence and risk factors for MCTs in  dogs attending English primary-care veterinary practices. METHODS: Electronic  patient records from practices participating in the VetCompass animal  surveillance project between July 2007 and June 2013 were searched for MCT  diagnosis. Various search terms and standard diagnostic terms (VeNom codes)  identified records containing MCT diagnoses, which were evaluated against  clinical criteria for inclusion to the study. MCT prevalence for the entire  dataset and specific breed types were calculated. Descriptive statistics  characterised MCT cases and multivariable logistic regression methods evaluated  risk factors for association with MCT (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Within a population of  168,636 dogs, 453 had MCT, yielding a prevalence of 0.27% (95% confidence  interval (CI) 0.24% - 0.29%). The highest breed type specific prevalences were  for the Boxer at 1.95% (95% CI 1.40% - 2.51%), Golden Retriever at 1.39% (0.98% -  1.81%) and Weimaraner at 0.85% (95% CI 0.17% to 1.53%). Age, insurance status,  neuter status, weight and breed type were associated with MCT diagnosis. Of dogs  of specific breed type, the Boxer, Pug and Staffordshire Bull Terrier showed  greater odds of MCT diagnosis compared with crossbred dogs. Conversely, the  German Shepherd Dog, Border Collie, West Highland White Terrier, Springer Spaniel  and Cocker Spaniel had reduced odds of MCT diagnosis compared with crossbred  dogs. No association was found between MCT diagnosis and sex. CLINICAL  SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights a clinically significant prevalence of MCT  and identifies specific breed types with predisposition to MCT, potentially  aiding veterinarian awareness and facilitating diagnosis.","2015","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1","","","2","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26401329  PMCID: PMC4579370","","","","Prevalence; Canine; Primary-care practice; Epidemiology; Mast cell; Mastocytoma; Oncology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study population included all dogs within the  VetCompass Programme (September 1, 2009-June 13, 2014). Overall, the period  prevalence of symptomatic CM/SM was 0.05 per cent (95 per cent CI 0.04 per cent  to 0.06 per cent) for all breeds. The period prevalence in the Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel (CKCS) was 1.6 per cent (95 per cent CI 1.2 to 2.06).

Pain  was the most commonly associated clinical sign (67 dogs, 72 per cent). Analgesics  were prescribed to 72 (77.4 per cent) of the symptomatic dogs. Despite its low  overall period prevalence, the high proportion of affected dogs identified with  chronic pain suggests a significant welfare issue. Financial implications could  impede the diagnostic process and lead to underestimation of the true prevalence.

The relevance of SGLT1 expression in predisposition to  diabetes mellitus and to obesity was investigated in dogs. Cultured Caco-2/TC7  cells were shown to express SGLT1 in vitro. A 2-kbp fragment of the Slc5a1 5'  flanking region was cloned from canine genomic DNA, ligated into reporter gene  plasmids, and shown to drive reporter gene expression in these cells above  control (P < 0.001). To determine the effect of the 3 known SNPs in this region  on promoter function, new promoter/reporter constructs (all permutations of these  3 SNPs) were created by site-directed mutagenesis. No significant differences in  promoter function were seen, suggesting that these SNPs do not have a significant  effect on the constitutive transcription of SGLT1 mRNA in dogs. A search for  novel SNPs in this region in dogs was made in 2 breeds predisposed to diabetes  mellitus (Samoyed and cairn terrier), 2 breeds that rarely develop diabetes  (boxer and German shepherd), and 2 breeds predisposed to obesity (Labrador  retriever and cocker spaniel). The Slc5a1 5' flanking region was amplified from  10 healthy individuals of each of these breeds by high-fidelity PCR with the use  of breed-labeled primers and sequenced by pyrosequencing. The sequence of the  Slc5a1 5' flanking region in all individuals of all breeds tested was identical.  On this evidence, variations in Slc5a1 promoter sequence between dogs do not  influence the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus or obesity in these breeds.","2013-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","139-144","","3","44","","Domest Anim Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: Case control study. ANIMALS: Dogs  with IOHC (n=20; 38 elbows) and 25 normal elbows. METHODS: Elbows with IOHC and  normal elbows were assessed by CT. Standardized dorsal and sagittal  reconstructions were created at 3 levels using image analysis software to obtain  single measurements of the humero-radial and humero-ulnar joint spaces. On dorsal  plane reconstructions, joint space measurements were obtained at the center point  of the humero-radial and humero-ulnar articulations. Joint incongruity was  defined as the difference between the humero-radial and the humero-ulnar joint  spaces. RESULTS: Nineteen dogs (95%), all Spaniel breeds, had either bilateral  IOHC demonstrable as a saw-toothed intercondylar complete or incomplete  hypoattenuating defect with hyperattenuating margins, or IOHC with contralateral  humeral condylar fracture (HCF). Joint incongruity values for IOHC were compared  with those of normal elbows. Significant differences were noted at the levels of  the medial coronoid apex (P<.0001) and base (P<.004) indicative of humero-ulnar  incongruence. Evidence of medial coronoid disease in 10 elbows (26%) and  degenerative joint disease in 30 elbows (79%) was also found. CONCLUSIONS:  Presence of elbow incongruence may be an underlying factor in failure of  ossification centers to fuse leading to IOHC. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: IOHC is clearly  defined by CT, and it should be considered in larger Spaniel breeds, with a  chronic forelimb lameness or HCF.","2008-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","226-231","","3","37","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18394068","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Case-Control Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods/*veterinary; Lameness, Animal/diagnostic imaging/etiology/pathology; Bone Diseases, Developmental/complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Forelimb/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Humeral Fractures/diagnostic imaging/etiology/veterinary; Joint Diseases/complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Radius/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Ulna/diagnostic imaging/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This fatal degenerative  condition is caused by an absence or deficiency of dystrophin in striated muscle.  Most affected patients have inherited or spontaneous deletions in the dystrophin  gene that disrupt the reading frame resulting in unstable truncated products. For  these patients, restoration of the reading frame via antisense  oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach. The  major DMD deletion ""hot spot"" is found between exons 45 and 53, and skipping exon  51 in particular is predicted to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in the  greatest number of patients. Currently the mdx mouse is the most widely used  animal model of DMD, although its mild phenotype limits its suitability in  clinical trials. The Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model has a  severe phenotype, but due to its large size, is expensive to use. Both these  models have mutations in regions of the dystrophin gene distant from the commonly  mutated DMD ""hot spot"". METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe the  severe phenotype, histopathological findings, and molecular analysis of Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy (CKCS-MD). The  dogs harbour a missense mutation in the 5' donor splice site of exon 50 that  results in deletion of exon 50 in mRNA transcripts and a predicted premature  truncation of the translated protein. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping  of exon 51 in cultured myoblasts from an affected dog restored the reading frame  and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Given the small size of the  breed, the amiable temperament and the nature of the mutation, we propose that  CKCS-MD is a valuable new model for clinical trials of antisense  oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping and other therapeutic approaches for DMD.","2010-01-13","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e8647","","1","5","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20072625  PMCID: PMC2800183","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Dystrophin/*genetics; Phenotype; *Mutation; Base Sequence; *Exons; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Immunohistochemistry; *Disease Models, Animal; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne/*genetics/pathology; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Maltese dogs, 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT  transporter (SERT) gene are suggested to associate with MMVD.  HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Determine the association of SERT polymorphisms on MMVD  severity and serum 5-HT concentration in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS).  Additionally, investigate the association between selected clinical and  hematologic variables and serum 5-HT and assess the correlation between HPLC and  ELISA measurements of serum 5-HT. ANIMALS: Seventy-one CKCS (42 females and 29  males; 7.8 [4.7;9.9] years (median [Q1;Q3])) in different MMVD stages. METHODS:  This prospective study used TaqMan genotyping assays to assess SERT gene  polymorphisms. Neurotransmitter concentrations were assessed by HPLC and ELISA.  RESULTS: TaqMan analyses identified none of the selected SERT polymorphisms in  any of the CKCS examined. Serum 5-HT was associated with platelet count  (P < .001) but not MMVD severity, age or medical therapy and did not correlate  with serum concentration of the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The  ELISA serum 5-HT correlated with HPLC measurements (ρ = .87; P < .0001) but was  lower (mean difference = -22 ng/mL; P = .02) independent of serum 5-HT  concentration (P = .2). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Selected SERT SNPs  associated with MMVD in Maltese dogs were not found in CKCS and only platelet  count influenced serum 5-HT concentration. These SNPs are unlikely to be  associated with MMVD pathophysiology or serum 5-HT concentration in CKCS.

We sought to determine  common signs. ANIMALS: One hundred thirty client-owned Cavalier King Charles  spaniels with neuroaxis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosis of  CM-P/SM. Dogs with comorbidities causing similar signs were excluded with  exception of otitis media with effusion (OME). METHODS: Retrospective study of  medical records relating signalment, signs, and MRI findings. Dogs were grouped  by SM maximum transverse diameter (1 = no SM; 2 = 0.5-1.99 mm; 3 = 2-3.9 mm: 4 =  ≥4 mm). Differences between all groups-groups 1 versus 2-4 and groups 1-3 versus  4-were investigated. Continuous variables were analyzed using 2-sample t-tests  and analysis of variance. Associations between categorical variables were  analyzed using Fisher's exact or chi-square tests. RESULTS: Common signs were  vocalization (65.4%), spinal pain (54.6%), reduced activity (37.7%), reduced  stairs/jumping ability (35.4%), touch aversion (30.0%), altered emotional state  (28.5%), and sleep disturbance (22%). Head scratching/rubbing (28.5%) was  inversely associated with syrinx size (P = .005), less common in group 4 (P =  .003), and not associated with OME (P = .977). Phantom scratching, scoliosis,  weakness, and postural deficits were only seen in group 4 (SM ≥4 mm; P = .004).  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Signs of pain are common in CM/SM but are  not SM-dependent, suggesting (not proving) CM-P causality.

Occipital hypoplasia results in reduced volume of  the caudal fossa, leading to overcrowding of the neural structures and, in severe  cases, development of syringomyelia. In occipital dysplasia, there is a failure  of complete ossification of the supraoccipital bone. When the two conditions  occur concurrently, it is possible that syringomyelia may develop more slowly,  resulting in presentation with clinical signs in middle to old age. This has  implications for screening tests for early detection of syringomyelia, with a  view to using the dog for breeding purposes, as dogs with an apparently mild  phenotype for occipital hypoplasia/syringomyelia may actually have a more severe  genotype.","2006-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","603-606","","10","47","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17004953","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Pedigree; Genotype; Dog Diseases/*genetics/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Fatal Outcome; Occipital Bone/*pathology; Syringomyelia/complications/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Bone Diseases/complications/genetics/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: 134 healthy adult CKCS. METHODS: Ultrasound examinations  were performed by trained observers in awake dogs. M-mode variables included left  ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, LV free wall and  interventricular septal thicknesses at end-diastole and end-systole, and LV  fractional shortening (FS%). The left atrium (LA) and aortic (Ao) diameters were  measured using a 2D method, and the LA/Ao was calculated. Pulsed-wave Doppler  variables included peak systolic aortic and pulmonary flow velocities, mitral E  and A waves, and E/A ratio. Effects of BW, age, and gender on these 15 variables  were tested using a general linear model, and RIs were determined by applying the  statistical procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards  Institute. RESULTS: A significant BW effect was observed for all variables,  except LA/Ao, FS%, and mitral E/A ratio. A significant but negligible effect of  gender and age was also observed for 5/15 and 4/15 of the tested variables,  respectively.

Both CM and SM are currently screened in the Netherlands prior  to breeding and are graded according to the British Veterinary Association's  Kennel Club (BVA/KC) scheme. This study evaluated the prevalence and estimated  genetic parameter of CM, SM and middle ear effusion from 12 years of screening  results. For SM, the classical method using the BVA/KC scheme, was compared with  exact measuring of the central canal dilation. For CM, the BVA/KC scheme was  compared with a more detailed scheme. Next to this the presence of microchip  artifacts was assessed. 1249 screening of 1020 dogs were re-evaluated. Results  indicated the presence of CM in all dogs, suggesting it has become a  breed-specific characteristic. And although different grades of CM were observed,  the condition did not deteriorate over time. SM was present in 39% of the dogs  and a clear age effect was demonstrated, with SM increasing with age. This  emphasizes the importance of screening at appropriate age, since SM can worsen  with increasing age. One alternative is to promote repeated measures. The  presence of middle ear effusion in this study was 19%-21% for dogs younger than 3  years, and 32%-38% for dogs older than 3 years. In as much as 60%, microchip  artifacts were noticed, leading to the recommendation to place microchips in  another location in breeds that are susceptible to developing SM. Finally, this  study estimated the heritability of CM in this population, due to the lack of  phenotypic variance, to be very low at 0.02-0.03. The heritability for SM central  canal dilatation to be 0.30, compared to 0.13 for the classical BVA/KC method,  using a model including the age effect and the combined effect of veterinary  clinic and year of the evaluation. Genetic correlations were rather small,  ranging from 0.16-0.33. As a conclusion, screening for SM and CM in the entire  population should be maintained, and a selection scheme against SM should be  based on estimated breeding values for the exact measurement of the central canal  dilatation.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0184893","","9","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28934242  PMCID: PMC5608246","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Species Specificity; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Severity of Illness Index; Age Factors; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*veterinary; Artifacts; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/genetics; Genetic Testing; Netherlands; Otitis Media with Effusion/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*veterinary; Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  studied the diploid-polyploid complex of Alyssum montanum-A. repens, focusing on  Apennine and adjacent southwestern Alpine populations from southeastern France,  with the aim of examining their taxonomic position and evolutionary patterns.  METHODS: We employed AFLP markers and cpDNA sequences, along with cytotype  determination using flow cytometry, and a multivariate morphometric approach. KEY  RESULTS: The Italian and French populations formed two well-delimited groupings  within the studied complex that were, in contrast to previous taxonomic  treatments, clearly distinct from A. montanum. Populations from southeastern  France represent A. orophilum, a previously described but abandoned species.  Those from central and southern Italy correspond to A. diffusum, exhibiting high,  geographically structured variation (central Apennines, Gargano, and southern  Apennines/Calabria). This pattern coincides with hotspot refugial regions, in  congruence with the ""refugia-within-refugia"" hypothesis, and is reflected here in  the recognition of three subspecies within A. diffusum. CONCLUSIONS: We provide  evidence for the presence of Mediterranean refugia for the studied Alyssum  montanum-A. repens complex located in central and southern Italy, which, however,  did not contribute to the postglacial colonization of Central Europe. Past  extinctions, genetic bottlenecks, and recent expansion were inferred in Central  Europe, while long-term accumulation of diversity as well as polyploidization  occurred in the Apennines.","2011-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1887-1904","","11","98","","Am J Bot","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22052961","","","","*Genetic Variation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; France; Italy; *Evolution, Molecular; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Brassicaceae/*classification/*genetics; DNA, Chloroplast; Genetics, Population; Phylogeography; Polyploidy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mammalian fucosidases are sialoglycoproteins and the carbohydrate, particularly  sialic acid, contributes to producing multiple isoforms which can differ in  various species as well as in different tissues within a given species.  alpha-L-Fucosidases exhibit maximal activity at pH values between 4 and 7, have  similar kinetic properties with synthetic substrates (PNP-fucoside and  4-MU-fucoside), and exhibit broad substrate specificity on natural substrates.  Numerous linkages (alpha 1-2, alpha 1-3, alpha 1-4, alpha 1-6), primarily to  galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, can be hydrolyzed but preference is often seen  for small mol. wt water-soluble substrates with fucose in alpha 1-2 linkage to  galactose.

Finite element (FE) modelling of a distal humerus was generated, and  loading of fracture repairs using a lateral plate and caudal plate was completed  in a comparative study to determine which fixation method resisted micro-motion  most effectively. Finite element analysis revealed that the lateral plate  fixation provided significantly more resistance to micro movement at the fracture  site that the caudal plate fixation, with 40% more micro-motion in the latter.","2007","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","285-290","","4","20","","Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 18038005","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Prospective Studies; Radiography; Dogs/*injuries/surgery; Bone Plates/*veterinary; Finite Element Analysis; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary/*veterinary; Fracture Healing; Humeral Fractures/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated that the canine epidermis expressed the  cytokeratins 1, 5, 6, 10/11, 14 and 16. There were no consistent differences in  CK expression between the examined breeds with the exception of an individual  polymorphism in CK1 and CK10/11. Immunohistochemical studies showed CK 14  labelling of the basal cell layer whereas CK10/11 staining was seen in the  suprabasal cell layer of epidermis. Surprisingly, expression of CK6, known as  'stress' cytokeratin, was demonstrated in all epidermal samples. These results  indicate that there is a striking consistency of cytokeratin expression in  different breeds which should be useful in the investigation and characterization  of canine skin diseases.","2001-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","81-87","","2","12","","Vet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11360341","","","","Animals; Breeding; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Dogs/*anatomy & histology; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/veterinary; *Keratins; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Blotting, Western/veterinary; Skin/*cytology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Truncation selection, that is the exclusion of  affected animals, may be very inefficient when selecting on a large number of  traits, and may result in a reduction of the genetic diversity in a population or  breed. Selection could be facilitated by the use of a selection index that  combines multiple traits or breeding values into one score. This however requires  a consideration of their relative value according to their economic weight, which  is difficult to express in monetary units for health traits. The use of a choice  experiment to derive non-market values might be a solution to this problem. This  is a pilot study to assess the potential use of choice experiments to ascertain  the public preference and relative importance attached to health- and  conformation traits in the selection of a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The  focus was on two prevalent disorders, mitral valve disease and syringomyelia, and  on several important conformation traits such as muzzle length and eye shape.  Based on available prior information, a Bayesian D-optimal design approach was  used to develop a choice experiment and the resulting choice sets. RESULTS: Every  participant (breeder or owner) in the choice experiment was presented with a  total of 17 choice sets, in which at most four traits could vary to reduce the  cognitive burden. A total of 114 respondents participated in the choice  experiment and results showed that respondents (breeders/owners) current  attitudes were directed towards health (syringomyelia and mitral valve disease),  followed by eye shape and level of inbreeding. CONCLUSIONS: This approach  identifies the value breeders and owners attach to certain traits in the breeding  objective. The resulting relative weights, represented as the logworths obtained  from the choice experiment, could be an alternative to economic weights. They  could be implemented as a weight when breeding values are available, but more  study on this topic will be necessary. A challenge in this approach is to scale  up the experiment with additional traits. Moreover, for other traits, the genetic  parameters and correlations should be known first, in order to include them in  the health selection index as well.","2018","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1","","","5","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29403647  PMCID: PMC5778675","","","","Syringomyelia; Dog; Mitral valve disease; Choice experiment; Selection; Weighted index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on eight breeds were analyzed for  age at death (including euthanasia). If dogs left the insurance for reasons other  than death, they were regarded as censored. Dogs were only insured up to 10 years  of age. Four analytical approaches were used. First, descriptive statistics of  age distributions (e.g. breed-specific median ages at death, breed- and  age-specific mortality risks) were computed. Second, age-specific estimates of  survival were calculated using the formula: survival=(1-risk(age<1  year))(1-risk(age 1<2 year))... (1-risk(age 9<1 0 year)). Third, Cox regression  (proportional-hazards model) was used to estimate survival and hazard functions.  Finally, hierarchically coded Poisson regression was used to determine  age-specific cut-points in the risk of death. The hazards from Cox and the  incidence-density rates from the hierarchically coded models were transformed to  estimates of risk: risk=1-exp¿-(hazard)¿ or 1-exp¿-(incidence-density rate)¿. The  breeds studied were Beagle, Bernese mountain dog, Boxer, Cavalier King Charles  spaniel, Drever, German shepherd dog, Mongrel and Poodle, together representing  over 50000 dogs each year. The yearly breed-specific mortality risk varied  between 1.7% (Poodle) and 6.5% (Bernese mountain dog). In all breeds, the risk of  death increased with age but the pattern varied by breed. The probability of  survival at 5 years of age varied between 94% (Cavalier King Charles spaniel and  Poodle) and 83% (Bernese mountain dog, Drever, German shepherd dog) and the  survival at 10 years between 83% (Poodle) and 30% (Bernese mountain dog). The  survival estimates from Cox and those derived using the combined-risk formula  were similar. The cut-point risk estimates provided a simplified picture of when  the risk of death changed significantly compared to previous age categories. As  anticipated, breeds differed widely in survival up to 10 years of age and there  were marked differences in age patterns of mortality. The implications of these  findings should be considered in multivariable analyses, where the confounding  effect of age is often controlled for using a single age variable common to  several breeds.","2000-07-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1-14","","1","46","","Prev Vet Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 10854932","","","","Animals; Species Specificity; Risk Factors; *Dogs; Databases, Factual; Age Distribution; Sweden; *Insurance, Life; *Mortality; Poisson Distribution; Proportional Hazards Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to further  characterize the clinical and clinicopathological features of and to identify the  causative genetic variant for a dyserythropoietic anemia and myopathy syndrome  (DAMS) in English springer spaniel dogs (ESSPs). Twenty-six ESSPs, including five  dogs with DAMS and two puppies that died perinatally, were studied. Progressive  weakness, muscle atrophy-particularly of the temporal and pelvic muscles-trismus,  dysphagia, and regurgitation due to megaesophagus were observed at all ages.  Affected dogs had a non-regenerative, microcytic hypochromic anemia with  metarubricytosis, target cells, and acanthocytes. Marked erythroid hyperplasia  and dyserythropoiesis with non-orderly maturation of erythrocytes and  inappropriate microcytic metarubricytosis were present. Muscle biopsies showed  centralized nuclei, central pallor, lipocyte infiltrates, and fibrosis, which was  consistent with centronuclear myopathy. The genome sequencing of two affected  dogs was compared to 782 genomes of different canine breeds. A homozygous  frameshift single-base deletion in EHBP1L1 was identified; this gene was not  previously associated with DAMS. Pedigree analysis confirmed that the affected  ESSPs were related. Variant genotyping showed appropriate complete segregation in  the family, which was consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.  This study expands the known genotype-phenotype correlation of EHBP1L1 and the  list of potential causative genes in dyserythropoietic anemias and myopathies in  humans. EHBP1L1 deficiency was previously reported as perinatally lethal in  humans and knockout mice. Our findings enable the genetic testing of ESSP dogs  for early diagnosis and disease prevention through targeted breeding strategies.","2022-08-26","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","9","13","","Genes (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36140701  PMCID: PMC9498568","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; canine; Canis lupus familiaris; precision medicine; Syndrome; animal model; Mice; Genetic Association Studies; *Anemia; *Dog Diseases/diagnosis/genetics; *Muscular Diseases/genetics/pathology/veterinary; cardiomyopathy; centronuclear myopathy; Frameshift Mutation/genetics; megaesophagus; metarubricytosis; microcytosis; perinatal death","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A functional MRI pilot study.","European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists","","0924-9338","10.1016/j.eurpsy.2006.11.002","","AIM: Previous studies have suggested altered structural and functional asymmetry of the brain in schizophrenia. METHODS: Functional MRI was used to assess  differences in cortical activation during a verbal task in Broca's area and its  contralateral homologue in four pairs of right-handed monozygotic (MZ) twins  discordant and concordant for schizophrenia with low and high familial loading  for the illness and four healthy control MZ twin pairs. RESULTS: Pooled data from  all subjects with schizophrenia showed increased activation in the right  homologue of Broca's area in contrast to healthy individuals. Concordant twins  (i.e. high familial loading group) showed prominent between co-twin differences  in lateralization index within given region of interest. Intra-pair differences  in lateralization index were significantly higher in concordant twins compared to  the controls (0.69+/-0.4 vs. 0.13+/-0.13, P<0.03), albeit no significant  differences in the variable were shown between the discordant and control groups.  CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of reduced cerebral dominance for  language processing in patients with schizophrenia. The findings further suggest  the need for additional research on relative proportion of genetic and  environmental factors underlying deviations of functional asymmetry in  schizophrenia.","2007-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","319-322","","5","22","","Eur Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17434292","","","","Humans; Female; Male; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adult; Middle Aged; Diseases in Twins/*genetics/physiopathology/psychology; Dominance, Cerebral/*genetics/physiology; Frontal Lobe/*physiopathology; Schizophrenia/*genetics/physiopathology; Social Environment; Speech/*physiology; Twins, Monozygotic/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Canine breeds with a  predisposition to higher eosinophil counts or certain eosinophilic diseases  include the Rottweiler, German Shepard, Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Two of the more common causes of canine  hypereosinophilia are pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophils (PIE) and  gastrointestinal disease. The highest eosinophil counts are expected in dogs with  pneumonia or PIE. The most common cause of eosinophilia in cats is flea allergy.  The greatest eosinophilia occurs in cats with flea allergy, feline asthma, and  eosinophilic granuloma. Innovative recent treatments for human patients with  asthma have been successful in reducing eosinophil numbers but have had a  confusing and disappointing lack of reducing symptoms.

Older puppies had focal cartilage necrosis within lumbar  vertebral epiphyses. At the cellular level, lesions were characterized by  chondrocytic hypertrohy and lysosomal accumulation of storage compounds. Our  studies illustrate that the skeletal lesions in both canine models are similar to  those in a child with GM1-gangliosidosis.

Five globes in which  intravitreal membranes were identified were evaluated. These originated from four  Labrador Retrievers or Labrador-cross dogs and a Springer Spaniel. The ages of  the dogs ranged from 4 to 11 years. Standard histology and immunohistochemical  procedures for factor VIII-related antigen, smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin  and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were performed. Intravitreal membranes  varied from loosely to highly organized. The extent of organization corresponded  with increasing immunoreactivity for vimentin and GFAP, indicating their  predominantly glial origin. They were never immunopositive for smooth muscle  actin, nor were they vascularized. In all cases, they were associated with  intravitreal hemorrhage. Additional common findings included epiretinal  membranes, retinal neovascularization, preiridal fibrovascular membranes and  glaucoma. Intravitreal membranes may be a sequelae of intravitreal hemorrhage.  This in turn, may arise from new vessels associated with epiretinal or preiridial  membranes, or hemorrhage associated with optic disc cupping or retinal  neovascularization. All of these phenomena may accompany glaucoma.","2004-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","239-243","","4","7","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15200620","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Vitreous Hemorrhage/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of case records at the University of Utrecht Small Animal Clinic revealed that during a 4-year  period glaucoma accounted for 8.6% of all ophthalmological diagnoses. Glaucoma is  defined as an increased intraocular pressure, which sooner or later leads to loss  of function of the eye. Primary and secondary types can be distinguished. In  primary glaucoma an increased intraocular pressure exists in the absence of other  primary eye disorders. By gonioscopy a discrimination can be made between open  and narrow or closed anterior chamber angle forms of primary glaucoma. This  requires a clear distinction between the definitions of chamber angle and  filtration angle. In the Netherlands primary glaucoma is seen especially in the  American Cocker Spaniel, Bouvier and Basset breeds. In secondary glaucoma an  increased intraocular pressure occurs as a consequence of another primary eye  disorder. Dislocation of the lens is the main cause for secondary glaucoma.  Several-mainly small-terrier breeds are predisposed to this entity.","1985-03-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","219-227","","6","110","","Tijdschr Diergeneeskd","","","","","","","","dut","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 3873120","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Species Specificity; Dog Diseases/*physiopathology; Cats; Intraocular Pressure; Cat Diseases/*physiopathology; Glaucoma/classification/physiopathology/*veterinary; Lens Subluxation/physiopathology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical signs can vary from low-grade recurrent  gastrointestinal signs to acute exacerbations that are indistinguishable from  classical acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a significant cause of  chronic pain in dogs, which must not be underestimated. It also results in  progressive impairment of endocrine and exocrine function and the eventual  development of diabetes mellitus or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or both in  some affected dogs at end stage. The etiology is unknown in most cases. Chronic  pancreatitis shows an increased prevalence in certain breeds, and recent work in  English Cocker Spaniels suggests it is part of a polysystemic immune-mediated  disease in this breed. The histological and clinical appearance is different in  different breeds, suggesting that etiologies may also be different. Diagnosis is  challenging because the sensitivities of the available noninvasive tests are  relatively low.

ANIMALS: Three hundred and three dogs were included in this  retrospective study. Animal ages ranged from 6 months to 14.8 years. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: All records of dogs seen by the Ophthalmology Service of Policlínica  Veterinária Botafogo between January 2005 and June 2008 were reviewed. Animals  with cataracts were separated, and breed and age were evaluated. RESULTS: Most of  the dogs presented with cataracts were Toy Poodles with a mean age of 8.2 years,  followed by Cocker Spaniels and Bichon Frises. The percentage of Toy Poodles  affected with cataracts was 13.8% while 33.3% of Bichon Frise was diagnosed with  cataracts. CONCLUSIONS: Toy Poodles are a popular breed in Rio de Janeiro.  Without regulations on breeding, the prevalence of cataracts may increase  rapidly. Furthermore, due to the relatively late onset of cataract formation in  the Toy Poodle (mean 8.2 years of age), affected animals may have produced  several litters of puppies.

ANIMALS STUDIED: Four eyes of four  dogs (3 Shih Tzus and 1 English Cocker Spaniel) with corneal edema due to CED  were treated with SK and CXL. Two were males, and two were females. PROCEDURE:  Depending on corneal thickness, 500-700 μm of edematous cornea was removed by SK.  Next, CXL was performed by irradiating the cornea with UVA (365 nm) at 3 mW/cm²  irradiance for 30 min after soaking with 0.1% riboflavin in 20% dextran every  three minutes for 30 minutes. One drop of riboflavin was instilled every three  minutes during irradiation. Slit lamp biomicroscopy and optical coherence  tomography were used to examine the cornea during the follow-up period. RESULTS:  The corneas had focal to diffuse edema, and the average corneal thickness was  1553 (1282-1900) μm. All corneas showed a significantly reduced corneal thickness  and regained marked transparency immediately after treatment; however, the  opacity increased as the corneal thickness increased during the follow-up period.  Corneal vascularization (n = 4) disappeared within a month. Corneal pigmentation  (n = 1) and bullae (n = 1) were observed. All cases showed marked reduction in  corneal thickness; however, transparency was improved in only one case.  CONCLUSION: Collagen cross-linking with SK has the potential to reduce the  corneal thickness in CED cases; however, a lasting clinically significant  improvement of corneal transparency seems unlikely. As the added benefit of CXL  to the SK procedure is unclear based on the results of this study, combined  treatment of CXL and SK for the treatment of corneal edema caused by CED is  currently not recommended in dogs.","2019-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","440-447","","4","22","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30109755","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; dog; Keratectomy/*veterinary; superficial keratectomy; Combined Modality Therapy/veterinary; Collagen/*chemistry; corneal collagen cross-linking; Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary/therapy/*veterinary; corneal endothelial dystrophy; Corneal Pachymetry/veterinary; Cross-Linking Reagents/*therapeutic use; Dog Diseases/pathology/surgery/*therapy; Photosensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use; Riboflavin/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aetiology of the myocardial hypokineis is seldom known in the  individual case of DCM, although several theories concerning genetic,  nutritional, metabolic, inflammatory, infectious, or drug- or toxin-induced  myocardial disease have been discussed. DCM is often referred to as being  breed-specific for Boxers, Doberman Pinschers, English Cocker Spaniels and other  breeds. Review of reports on histopathologic findings in canine DCM reveals two  histologically distinct forms of DCM; (1) cardiomyopathy of boxers and of  Doberman pinschers, corresponding to the ""fatty infiltration-degenerative"" type,  and (2) the form seen in many giant, large- and medium-sized breeds, including  some boxers and Doberman pinschers, which can be classified as the ""attenuated  wavy fiber"" type of DCM. The classification of canine idiopathic DCM according to  histologic findigns seems superior to classification suggesting breed-specific  syndromes, as some breeds (i.e. boxers and Doberman pinschers) may be affected by  both diseases. However, ante mortem aetiological diagnosis of DCM is difficult.

This study was conducted to  investigate the relationship between sexual hormones and mammary gland tumors in  a male dog. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old, intact male Cocker Spaniel  presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Kangwon National University,  Republic of Korea, with an acute right ruptured caudal abdominal mass. Physical  examination revealed a 14 × 14 cm ruptured mass in the right caudal abdomen, as  well as a 1.5 × 1.5 cm mass in the first right mammary gland. The estrogen and  progesterone concentrations in serum were within normal levels. Total mastectomy  was done on the right side mammary glands. Following surgery, the site was fully  recovered; however, a mass that had grown to 2 × 2 cm was found in the left fifth  mammary gland and a testis tumor was also found over the period of 4 months.  Mastectomy was performed on the left caudal mammary gland and castration was also  performed. After the final surgery, the dog fully recovered. Histopathological  examination of all three masses revealed high grade mammary adenocarcinoma in the  mammary gland and the testis was diagnosed as Leydig cell adenoma.  Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the estrogen and progesterone  receptors were expressed on limited cells in mammary and testis tumors.  CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that mammary tumors and testes  tumors can occur in male dogs without relationship to female sexual hormone.","2017-04-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","20","","1","59","","Acta Vet Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28399884  PMCID: PMC5387325","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Treatment Outcome; Dog; Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma/pathology/surgery/*veterinary; Estrogen receptor; Estrogens/blood; Leydig Cell Tumor/secondary/surgery/*veterinary; Mammary gland tumor; Mammary Glands, Animal/pathology; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*pathology/*surgery; Orchiectomy/veterinary; Progesterone receptor; Progesterone/blood; Republic of Korea; Testicular Neoplasms/secondary/surgery/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to  investigate associations between myocardial Q10 concentrations and myxomatous  mitral valve disease (MMVD) severity in dogs. Furthermore, citrate synthase (CS)  activity was analysed to determine if a reduction in myocardial Q10 was  associated with mitochondrial depletion in the myocardium. Thirty Cavalier King  Charles spaniels (CKCS) in MMVD stages B1 (n = 11), B2 (n = 5) and C (n = 14)  according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM)  guidelines and 10 control (CON) dogs of other breeds were included. Myocardial  Q10 concentration was analysed in left ventricular tissue samples using HPLC-ECD.  CKCS with congestive heart failure (CHF; group C) had significantly reduced Q10  concentrations (median, 1.54 µg/mg; IQR, 1.36-1.94), compared to B1 (2.76 µg/mg;  2.10-4.81, p < 0.0018), B2 (3.85 µg/mg; 3.13-4.46, p < 0.0054) and CON dogs (2.8  µg/mg; 1.64-4.88, p < 0.0089). CS activity was comparable between disease groups.  In conclusion, dogs with CHF due to MMVD had reduced myocardial Q10  concentrations.

METHOD: Analysis of 273  T1-weighted mid-sagittal DICOM sequences of the hindbrain and craniocervical  junction from 99 Chihuahuas, 42 Affenpinschers and 132 CKCSs. The study compared  22 morphometric features (11 lines, eight angles and three ratios) of dogs with  and without SM using refined techniques based on previous studies of the Griffon  Bruxellois (GB) using Discriminant Function Analysis and ANOVA with post-hoc  corrections. RESULTS: The analysis identified 14/22 significant traits for SM in  the three dog breeds, five of which were identical to those reported for the GB  and suggest inclusion of a common aetiology. One ratio, caudal fossa height to  the length of the skull base extended to an imaginary point of alignment between  the atlas and supraoccipital bones, was common to all three breeds (p values  0.029 to <0.001). Associated with SM were a reduced occipital crest and two acute  changes in angulation i) 'sphenoid flexure' at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis  ii) 'cervical flexure' at the foramen magnum allied with medulla oblongata  elevation. Comparing dogs with and without SM, each breed had a unique trait:  Chihuahua had a smaller angle between the dens, atlas and basioccipital bone (p  value < 0.001); Affenpinschers had a smaller distance from atlas to dens (p value  0.009); CKCS had a shorter distance between the spheno-occipital synchondrosis  and atlas (p value 0.007). CONCLUSION: The selected morphometries successfully  characterised conformational changes in the brain and craniocervical junction  that might form the basis of a diagnostic tool for all breeds. The severity of SM  involved a spectrum of abnormalities, incurred by changes in both angulation and  size that could alter neural parenchyma compliance and/or impede cerebrospinal  fluid channels.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0169898","","1","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28121988  PMCID: PMC5266279","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Phenotype; Foramen Magnum/diagnostic imaging; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Discriminant Analysis; *Cephalometry; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/complications/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*veterinary; Cervical Vertebrae/*diagnostic imaging; Craniosynostoses/diagnostic imaging/genetics/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/genetics/pathology; Rhombencephalon/*diagnostic imaging; Skull Base/diagnostic imaging; Skull/*diagnostic imaging; Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/etiology/genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among dogs, 45 breeds were affected  with renal calculi. Thirty-three breeds and a crossbred group were represented  among females, but 8 breeds and the crossbred group accounted for 81% of the  total. Among male dogs, 30 breeds and a crossbred group were represented, but 7  breeds and the crossbred group accounted for 69% of the total. Among cats, 10  breeds and a crossbred group were represented. Dogs and cats with renal calculi  were older than those of 2 comparison population groups. More than one-half of  the renal calculi in both dogs and cats were from the 1st known episode of  urolithiasis. The risk of formation of renal calculi was found to be higher for  cats than for dogs, when compared to other stone-forming cats and dogs  (approximately 4.95 per 100 stone-forming cats and 2.88 per 100 stone-forming  dogs). Among dogs, breeds at highest risk of developing renal calculi were  Miniature Schnauzers, Shih Tzus, Lhasa Aposos, Yorkshire Terriers, and female  Pugs. Also at high risk were male Dalmatians and male Basset Hounds. Among small  dogs, females generally were at higher risk of developing renal calculi than were  males. Regardless of size, terrier breed males generally were at higher risk of  developing renal calculi. Breeds of dogs at low risk for development of renal  calculi included crossbreds. German Shepherd Dogs, Labrador Retrievers, Golden  Retrievers, and female Dachshunds. When only 1 kidney was involved, the risk of  left renal calculus was greatest for both dogs and cats, but bilateral renal  involvement was relatively common in both species (19% and 9%, respectively).  Among dogs, specimens composed of 1 mineral substance (e.g., struvite) occurred  more often in males (58.3%) than in females (37.9%). Female dogs formed renal  calculi containing struvite or oxalate more often than did males; males formed  calculi containing urate more often than did females. Calculi containing oxalate,  apatite, or some combination of these minerals predominated among cats; only 1  specimen from 38 female cats and only 4 specimens from 33 male cats contained  neither oxalate nor apatite. Crossbred cats were significantly less likely to  have renal calculi than were other breeds. A single renal calculus specimen was  identified in several uncommon breeds including Tonkinese and Birman cats, and  Affenpinscher, Clumber Spaniel, English Shepherd, and Field Spaniel dogs. No  significant differences were observed between male and female dogs or between  male and female cats with regard to mineral type of the specimen and the presence  of urinary tract infection.","1998-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","11-21","","1","12","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9503355","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Cats; Databases, Factual; Age Distribution; Sex Distribution; Bacteria/growth & development; Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology; Kidney Calculi/chemistry/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary; Minerals/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to  determine the pharmacokinetics of repeated oral dosing of Q10 in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with spontaneous myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD)  and to evaluate echocardiographic parameters, circulating cardiac biomarkers, and  quality of life (QoL) after treatment. The study is a randomized,  placebo-controlled, single-blinded crossover study. Nineteen CKCS with MMVD were  randomized to receive 100 mg Q10 (ubiquinone) bi-daily for three weeks, then  placebo (or in reverse order). Clinical examination, blood sampling,  echocardiography, and QoL assessment were performed before and after each  treatment phase. Q10 plasma concentrations were determined in plasma using a  validated high-performance liquid chromatography method using electrochemical  detection (HPLC-ECD). Eighteen CKCS were included in the analyses. Total plasma  concentration of Q10 increased significantly (p < 0.0001) from baseline (median,  0.92 µg/mL; interquartile range (IQR), 0.70-1.26) to after treatment (median,  3.51 µg/mL; IQR, 2.30-6.88). Thirteen dogs reached the threshold of a total  plasma Q10 concentration of ≥2.0 µg/mL. The average half-life (T(1/2)) of Q10 was  2.95 days (IQR, 1.75-4.02). No significant differences were observed in clinical  MMVD severity, and the owner perceived QoL between Q10 and placebo treatment. The  solubilized Q10 formulation was well-tolerated in the dogs. Individual variation  in plasma concentrations was observed following oral treatment. A long-term  placebo-controlled trial is warranted in dogs with MMVD to determine long-term  efficacy on the clinical severity of MMVD.","2020-09-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","9","9","","Antioxidants (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 32899633  PMCID: PMC7555137","","","","dog; congestive heart failure; antioxidant; degenerative mitral valve disease; ubiquinone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identification at a young age of dogs at high  risk of adverse outcome in the future is desirable. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To  study the predictive value of selected clinical and echocardiographic  characteristics associated with MMVD obtained at a young age for prediction of  long-term cardiac and all-cause mortality in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  (CKCS). ANIMALS: 1125 privately owned CKCS. METHODS: A retrospective study  including CKCS examined at the age of 1-3 years. Long-term outcome was assessed  by telephone interview with owners. The value of variables for predicting  mortality was investigated by Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier analyses.  RESULTS: Presence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (hazard ratio  (HR) = 3.03, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.48-6.23, P = 0.0025) even  intermittent moderate to severe MR (HR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.48-6.23, P = 0.039) on  color flow Doppler echocardiography was significantly associated with increased  hazard of cardiac death. An interaction between MR and sex was significant for  all-cause mortality (P = 0.035), showing that males with moderate to severe MR  had a higher all-cause mortality compared to males with no MR (HR = 2.38, 95% CI  = 1.27-4.49, P = 0.0071), whereas no difference was found between female MR  groups. The risk of cardiac (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14-1.63, P < 0.001) and  all-cause (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.24, P = 0.016) mortality increased with  increasing left ventricular end-systolic internal dimension normalized for body  weight (LVIDS(N) ).

Humeral intracondylar  fissures (HIF) are thought to be a predisposing factor for HCF occurrence in  skeletally mature dogs particularly when the fracture occurs during normal  activity. We hypothesised that HIF may be a predisposing factor for HCF in French  bulldogs. METHODS: A retrospective case series of nine French bulldogs that had  sustained HCF and where CT was performed prior to surgery. RESULTS: Five of the  fractured humeri had sclerosis adjacent to the fracture site. Six of the  contralateral intact humeri were diagnosed with HIF on the basis of a partial  (2/6) or complete (4/6) hypoattenuating area extending between the distal  articular surface and the supratrochlear foramen in the sagittal plane, with  adjacent sclerosis (6/6). CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of sclerosis at the  intracondylar fracture surface on CT can prompt suspicion that HIF preceded HCF.  A predisposing HIF has potentially great clinical significance for this breed if  we draw parallels with breeds such as the springer spaniel for whom HIF and  HIF-associated condylar fracture is well documented.","2021-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e504","","11","189","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 British Veterinary Association.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34021603","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; *Dog Diseases/epidemiology; Humerus/diagnostic imaging; *Humeral Fractures/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A high proportion of  ejaculated spermatozoa had midpiece droplets, bent tails and poor motility.  Severely vacuolated epididymal epithelial cells were observed by light  microscopy. Electron microscopic examination revealed membrane-bound vacuoles of  variable size containing scanty amounts of granular to fibrillar material in  epididymal epithelial cells, smooth muscle, myoid cells and Sertoli cells. Male  infertility is believed to result from lysosomal storage of fucosyl-linked  substrates in cells of the reproductive system. The extensive lesions in the  epididymis may have interfered with maturation and transport of spermatozoa.  Also, deficiency of alpha-L-fucosidase activity could have impaired the shedding  of cytoplasmic droplets from spermatozoa and altered the surface glycoprotein  composition of the sperm during epididymal transit.","1989-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","369-380","","4","100","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2760271","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Dog Diseases/*pathology/physiopathology; Epididymis/abnormalities/ultrastructure; Fucosidosis/complications/pathology/physiopathology/*veterinary; Infertility, Male/etiology/pathology/*veterinary; Sperm Count/veterinary; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa/abnormalities/*ultrastructure; Testis/abnormalities/ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: Seventy-eight privately owned Cavalier King Charles spaniels  with naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease. METHODS: Prospective  longitudinal study comprising 312 measurements over a 4.5 year period. Clinical  values were recorded, NT-proANP concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay,  and NOx were analyzed colorimetrically. To predict congestive heart failure  (CHF), Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates were  constructed. RESULTS: The hazard ratio for NT-proANP (per 1000 pmol/l increase)  to predict future CHF was 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-12.5; p < 0.001). The  median time to CHF for dogs with NT-proANP levels >1000 pmol/l was 11 months (95%  confidence interval, 5.6-12.6 months), compared to 54 months (46 - infinity) for  dogs with concentrations ≤ 1000 pmol/l (p < 0.001). Due to intra- and  inter-individual variability, most corresponding analyses for NOx were  insignificant but dogs reaching CHF had a lower mean NOx concentration than dogs  not reaching CHF (23 vs. 28 μmol/l, p = 0.016). Risk of CHF increased with  increase in heart rate (>130 beats per minute) and grade of murmur (≥ 3/6).  CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CHF due to mitral regurgitation is increased in dogs  with blood NT-proANP concentrations above 1000 pmol/l. Measurement of NT-proANP  can be a valuable tool to identify dogs that may develop CHF within months.","2014-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","141-154","","3","16","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

S.  intermedius showed significantly greater adherence to the head and neck compared  with the dorsum, but adherence to the limb, axilla and groin did not differ from  other sites. Furthermore, there was significantly greater adherence of S.  intermedius to corneocytes from the dorsum, forelimb, axilla and groin of Boxers  and Bull Terriers than Spaniels and Hounds.

A risk haplotype  (DLA-DRB1*00601/DQA1*005011/DQB1*00701) was present in 14.4% of cases and 6.5% of  controls and conferred an elevated risk of developing CH with an OR of 3.13 (95%  CI = 1.20-8.26).

Although the general pattern is similar, it is likely that  breed-specific differences exist. Detailed knowledge about the physiological  range of P4 concentrations may be helpful in cases of suspected hypoluteoidism.  The aim of this study was to investigate P4 changes during pregnancy in a small  and a large breed, to obtain reference values for specific intervals during  pregnancy and to test for breed- or body weight-specific differences. We studied  P4 concentrations in pregnancies from healthy Bernese mountain dogs (BMDs, n = 6)  and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs, n = 6) with a normal reproductive  history. Blood samples for P4 were taken to determine the day of ovulation and  after confirmation of pregnancy in regular intervals from Days 23 to 29 to Days  60 to 64. Bernese mountain dogs delivered 6.2 ± 2.6 puppies (range: 3-9)  63.4 ± 1.5 (range: 61-65) days after ovulation (excluding data from one BMD with  elective c-section) and CKCS delivered 3.3 ± 1.9 puppies (range: 1-5) 63.5 ± 1.1  (range: 62-65) days after ovulation. In general, the P4 concentrations of  individual dogs continuously decreased from the first to the last sampling during  pregnancy. Respective mean concentrations were Days 23 to 29: 19.2 ±  4.3/22.2 ± 3.9 ng/mL (BMD/CKCS), Days 30 to 34: 15.6 ± 2.3/17.7 ± 5.8 ng/mL, Days  35 to 39: 12.5 ± 2.8/14.1 ± 3.4 ng/mL, Days 40 to 44: 8.9 ± 1.4/11.8 ± 3.7 ng/mL,  Days 45 to 49: 7.7 ± 1.6/8.9 ± 1.9 ng/mL, Days 50 to 54:  6.0 ± 1.3/8.7 ± 7.1 ng/mL, Days 55 to 59: 4.7 ± 1.2/5.3 ± 2.8 ng/mL, and Days 60  to 64: 3.69 ± 1.86/2.62 ± 0.42 ng/mL. ANOVA indicated significant differences  over time within each breed when considered individually (P < 0.0001 each), but  not between breeds although mean P4 was slightly lower in BMD until Days 55 to  59. The present data clearly confirm the previously described P4 pattern during  canine pregnancy with highest P4 concentrations obtained in the first interval  (Days 23-29) and a subsequent decrease of P4. The lack of a significant rapid  prepartal P4 drop might be related to methodological issues (time of last  collection in regards to parturition). Other than expected, we failed to proof  significant differences in P4 between CKCS and BMD. Further studies are required  to confirm the results on a larger population of both breeds, but also other  large-sized breeds to test for the hypothesis if BMD might have lower P4  concentrations and smaller litter size compared to other large breeds with larger  litter size.","2016-10-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1850-1855.e1","","7","86","","Theriogenology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Perianal gland tumors appear to be androgen dependent.  Male dogs show a 5.6-fold-increased risk compared with females; endogenous  estrogens offer protection and the use of estrogenic hormones is conventional  therapy for the benign lesion. Both sexes of the cocker spaniel breed show  excessively high risk, suggesting that this dog family may be a model for genetic  studies that could be relevant to familial aggregations of hormone-related tumors  in men and women.

METHOD: A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using motor task with  temporal distortion of the visual feedback was employed. A task-related  functional connectivity was analyzed with the use of independent component  analysis (ICA). RESULTS: (1) During self-agency experience, FES showed a deficit  in cortical activation in medial frontal gyrus (BA 10) and posterior cingulate  gyrus, (BA 31; P < .05, Family-Wise Error [FWE] corrected). (2) Pooled-sample  task-related ICA revealed that the self/other-agency judgment was dependent upon  anti-correlated default mode and central-executive networks (DMN/CEN) dynamic  switching.

METHODS: Data on the numbers of litters born in the  previous 10 years were available from a cross-sectional study of dogs belonging  to breed club members (2004 Kennel Club/BSAVA Scientific Committee Purebred Dog  Health Survey). In this survey 151 breeds were represented with data for  households that had reported on at least 10 litters (range 10-14,15): this  represented 13,141 bitches which had whelped 22,005 litters. The frequency of  caesarean sections was estimated as the percentage of litters that were reported  to be born by caesarean section (caesarean rates) and are reported by breed. The  dogs were categorised into brachycephalic, mesocephalic and dolicocephalic  breeds. RESULTS: The 10 breeds with the highest caesarean rates were the Boston  terrier, bulldog, French bulldog, mastiff, Scottish terrier, miniature bull  terrier, German wirehaired pointer, Clumber spaniel, Pekingese and Dandie Dinmont  terrier.

The disease is recessively inherited in both species and  results from a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase. We have recently  cloned and sequenced the canine fucosidase gene (EMBL sequence admission number  X92448 (cDNA) and X92671-X92678 (individual exonic data)). The gene spans 12 kb  and consists of eight exons. SSCP based mutation analysis of affected animals was  carried out on the coding region of this gene both with exonic primers, and  intronic primer pairs for each exon. A 14 base pair deletion of the cDNA was  identified at the 3' end of exon 1 in fucosidosis affected animals. Surprisingly,  PCR based genomic cloning of DNA from these animals showed an identical deletion  in this DNA, ending at the start of intron 1. This change causes a frameshift  and, in consequence, 25 novel codons are transcribed in exon 2 before the first  of two adjacent premature stop codons is encountered.","1996-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","284-288","","4","33","","J Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8730282  PMCID: PMC1050576","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Exons; DNA Mutational Analysis; Cloning, Molecular; alpha-L-Fucosidase/genetics; Chromosome Deletion; Codon; Fucosidosis/genetics/*veterinary; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All dogs were fed a low sodium diet for at least  3 days before blood sampling in a home setting. There was a significant  difference between breeds with respect to both PRA (P = 0.0002), PAC (P = 0.002)  and PRA/PAC ratio (P < 0.0001). The highest PRA values were found in CKCS and  Poodles, two breeds known to be predisposed to chronic valvular disease. Five  CKCS had PRA values exceeding 3.0 ng/ml/h while this was the case in only one of  the remaining 75 dogs. In contrast to the high PRA values, CKCS had low PAC  values, and therefore much higher PRA/PAC ratios than the other breeds. In Irish  wolfhounds, both the PRA and PAC values were low. In conclusion, considerable  breed differences in PRA and PAC were found in the present study. Further studies  are needed to determine if there is an association between developing chronic  valvular disease and a high PRA in dogs.","1995-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","435-441","","7","42","","Zentralbl Veterinarmed A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8594837","","","","Animals; Female; Male; *Breeding; Aldosterone/*blood; Dogs/*blood/*genetics; Renin/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SM is a complex trait with a  moderately high heritability. Selective breeding against SM is confounded by its  complex inheritance, its late onset nature and high prevalence in some breeds.  This study investigated the early outcome of existing SM breeding guidelines. Six  hundred and forty-three dogs, 550 Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) and 93  Griffon Bruxellois (GB), were identified as having either one (454 dogs) or both  parents (189 dogs) with MRI-determined SM status. Offspring without SM were more  common when the parents were both clear of SM (SM-free; CKCS 70 per cent, GB 73  per cent). Conversely, offspring with SM were more likely when both parents had  SM (SM-affected; CKCS 92 per cent, GB 100 per cent). A mating of one SM-free  parent with an SM-affected parent was risky for SM affectedness with 77 per cent  of CKCS and 46 per cent of GB offspring being SM-affected. It is recommended that  all breeding dogs from breeds susceptible to SM be MRI screened; that the SM  status at five years old is established; and all results submitted to a central  database that can be used by dog breeders to better enable mate selection based  on estimated breeding values.","2011-12-24","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","681","","26","169","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21998144","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Pedigree; Genotype; *Selection, Genetic; *Breeding; Dog Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics/prevention & control; Syringomyelia/epidemiology/prevention & control/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even less is known about the inherited  risk factors underlying canine mammary tumors (CMT). Clear breed predispositions  exist, with 36% of English springer spaniels (ESS) in Sweden being affected.  Here, we evaluate 10 human breast cancer genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ERBB2,  FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, RCAS1, TOX3, and TP53) for association with CMTs.  Sixty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; four to nine SNPs per gene)  were genotyped by iPLEX in female ESS dogs, 212 CMT cases and 143 controls. Two  genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were significantly associated with CMT (Bonferroni  corrected P = 0.005 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Borderline association was  seen for FGFR2. Benign and malignant cases were also analyzed separately. Those  findings supported the association to BRCA1 and BRCA2 but with a stronger  association to BRCA1 in malignant cases. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 showed odds ratios  of approximately 4. In conclusion, this study indicates that BRCA1 and BRCA2  contribute to the risk of CMT in ESS, suggesting that dogs may serve as a good  model for human breast cancer.","2009-11-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","8770-8774","","22","69","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19887619","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; *Genes, BRCA1; *Genes, BRCA2; Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical signs include coughing, decreased exercise  tolerance, pulmonary edema, a ""machinery"" murmur in the pulmonic-aortic region,  and a bounding pulse. An ECG may reveal an increased amplitude of the R wave and  a lengthened P wave. Plain LAT films reveal loss of the cranial and caudal  cardiac waists, increased sternal contact of the heart, increased width and  straightened caudal border of the cardiac silhouette, elevated carina, and an  enlarged left atrium. Changes on plain DV films include an elongated cardiac  silhouette, enlarged right ventricle, and 3 bulges on the left side of the  cardiac silhouette. Nonselective angiocardiography can be used for a definitive  diagnosis and to demonstrate a reverse right-to-left PDA, in which the ascending  aorta, brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery are not opacified by  contrast medium. Animals with a right-to-left shunt PDA are cyanotic in caudal  body parts. Treatment of left-to-right shunt PDA involves ligation with 2  nonabsorbable sutures.

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by members of the Curly Coated Retriever  Clubs. Fourteen dogs (six in the United Kingdom, eight in Sweden) were clinically  examined and skin/hair samples collected for microscopy and histopathology. Blood  was collected for haematological, biochemical and endocrine assays. RESULTS: Of  90 dogs surveyed, 39 had current or previous episodes of symmetrical,  non-pruritic alopecia and or frizzy coat changes, usually affecting caudal  thighs, axillae, dorsum and neck before 18 months of age; 23 dogs had a  waxing/waning course. Examined dogs generally matched the pattern described in  questionnaires. Hair shaft anomalies comprised occasional distorted anagen bulbs  (10 dogs) and transverse fractures (8 dogs). Vertical histopathological sections  showed infundibular hyperkeratosis (28 of 30 sections) and low-grade pigment  clumping (17 of 30). Subtle telogenisation of hair follicles was unequivocally  confirmed by transverse histomorphometric analyses.

In this work,  hematosides of erythrocytes from 31 mongrel dogs and 108 dogs of 23 breeds were  examined individually by thin-layer chromatography, and the component sialic  acids were analysed by gas-liquid chromatography. Individual dogs had either  NAN-hematoside or NGN-hematoside: dogs with N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid also had a  trace of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, but dogs with N-acetyl-neuraminic acid had no  detectable N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid. A few mongrel dogs, some Kai dogs, Kishu  dogs, Japanese spaniels and most Shiba dogs had NGN-hematoside, whereas all  European dogs had NAN-hematoside and no NGN-hematoside. From pedigrees of some  families, inheritance of NGN-hematoside was found to be autosomal dominant.  NGN-hematoside is possibly one of dog blood group substances. The sialic acid of  delipidized ghost protein of dogs with NGN-hematoside was N-glycolyl-neuraminic  acid, and that of dogs with NAN-hematoside was N-acetyl-neuraminic acid.

Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a polymer that has been widely used  in cardiovascular surgery. In this case series, we report the autopsy and  histological findings in 6 dogs that underwent cardiopulmonary bypass for mitral  annuloplasty using ePTFE sheets and chordoplasty using ePTFE sutures. From May  2005 to October 2009, 3 female and 3 male dogs with severe mitral regurgitation  underwent mitral valve repair. This case series included 3 Cavalier King Charles  spaniels, 2 Maltese, and 1 Shih Tzu. The survival period after surgery was 19-72  (35 ± 19) months. In all the cases, autopsy revealed that the ePTFE sheets and  sutures were not damaged and well integrated into the surrounding highly  differentiated, connective tissues. Low-power microscopy revealed that in all  cases, the tissues surrounding the ePTFE sheet in the mitral valve annulus had  almost completely been covered by granulation tissue. No inflammatory infiltrate  or thrombogenesis was observed around the ePTFE in any of the cases. There was no  evidence of reactive changes in the region surrounding the ePTFE. These results  suggest that ePTFE has excellent tissue compatibility and durability and can be  effectively used for canine mitral valve repair.","2012-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","307-312","","1","14","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Crown Copyright Â© 2012.

In this study we pre-sent 2 novel cases of this disorder of sexual development and, in addition, a case of hereditary sex  reversal in a female with an enlarged clitoris. The first case was a male Moscow  watchdog with a normal karyotype (78,XY) and the presence of the SRY gene. In  this dog, perineal hypospadias, bilateral inguinal cryptorchidism and testes were  observed. The second case, representing the Cocker spaniel breed, had a small  penis with a hypospadic orifice of the urethra, bilateral cryptorchidism, testis  and a rudimentary gonad inside an ovarian bursa, a normal female karyotype  (78,XX) and a lack of the SRY gene. This animal was classified as a compound sex  reversal (78,XX, SRY-negative) with the hypospadias syndrome. The third case was  a Cocker spaniel female with an enlarged clitoris and internally located  ovotestes. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a normal female karyotype  (78,XX) and a lack of the SRY gene, while histology of the gonads showed an  ovotesticular structure. This case was classified as a typical hereditary sex  reversal syndrome (78,XX, SRY-negative). Molecular studies were focused on coding  sequences of the SRY gene (case 1) and 2 candidates for monogenic hypospadias,  namely MAMLD1 (mastermind-like domain containing 1) and SRD5A2  (steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2). Sequencing of the entire SRY  gene, including 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, did not reveal any mutation. The  entire coding sequence of MAMLD1 and SRD5A2 was analyzed in all the intersexes,  as well as in 4 phenotypically normal control dogs (3 females and 1 male). In  MAMLD1 2 SNPs, including 1 missense substitution in exon 1 (c.128A>G, Asp43Ser),  were identified, whereas in SRD5A2 7 polymorphisms, including 1 missense SNP  (c.358G>A, Ala120Thr), were found. None of the identified polymorphisms  cosegregated with the intersexual phenotype, thus, we cannot confirm that  hypospadias may be associated with polymorphism in the coding sequence of the  studied genes.","2012","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","128-134","","1-3","6","","Sex Dev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 S.

The  objective of this prospective cross-over study was to compare the effect of  gabapentin versus topiramate, as an add-on treatment to carprofen, on quality of  life (QoL) of dogs experiencing signs of neuropathic pain due to CM/SM. A visual  analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the QoL: (1) on day 0; (2) after 1 week  of carprofen only; (3) after 2 weeks on carprofen and gabapentin; and (4) after 2  weeks on carprofen and topiramate. No significant difference was observed between  VAS after gabapentin or topiramate (P=0.91). However, an improvement in QoL was  observed when gabapentin was compared with baseline (P=0.009), but not for  topiramate. In conclusion, the addition of gabapentin was more effective in  improving QoL than carprofen alone, but the study failed to identify that  gabapentin was more efficacious than topiramate. Perhaps the more favourable side  effect profile of the former makes it more suitable for the treatment of  neuropathic pain associated with CM/SM but further placebo-controlled trials are  required to assess the efficacy of these drugs.","2015-09-19","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","288","","11","177","","Vet Rec","","","","","","","","eng","British Veterinary Association.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26269418","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Prospective Studies; Cavalier King Charles Spaniel; Dog Diseases/*drug therapy; Syringomyelia/complications/drug therapy/*veterinary; Neuropathic pain; Quality of Life; Analgesics/*therapeutic use; Gabapentin; Amines/*therapeutic use; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/complications/drug therapy/*veterinary; Cross-Over Studies; Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/*therapeutic use; Fructose/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*therapeutic use; Neuralgia/drug therapy/etiology/*veterinary; Quality of life; Topiramate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hypoglycemia with concomitant hyperinsulinemia suggested an  insulin-secreting tumor. Pancreatic masses were resected, and insulinoma was  diagnosed. Six weeks later, the dog presented in hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic  crisis (HHC). The dog was initially stabilized with intravenous dextrose boluses  and infusions, but seizure activity recurred and persisted. A glucagon  constant-rate infusion (GCRI) was initiated, and neurological signs quickly  resolved. Dextrose was withdrawn over 24 hours, and euglycemia was maintained by  GCRI alone. Despite aggressive medical management including the use of  prednisone, diazoxide, bovine somatotropin, and streptozocin, the dog presented  on two subsequent occasions in HHC and both times was rapidly stabilized with  GCRI alone. In this dog, GCRI was a fast, safe, and effective method of achieving  and maintaining euglycemia despite intractable hyperinsulinism.

Therefore, identifying the cause of syncope is very important in treatment  planning. Herein, we report an etiology of syncope caused by pulmonary  hypertension (PH) associated with canine filariasis, followed by syncope due to  bradyarrhythmia 1 year later. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 8-year-old male English  Cocker Spaniel was referred to our hospital for a second opinion regarding  syncope that the dog had started experiencing approximately 2 months prior. Based  on the examination findings, we diagnosed that the fainting was due to heartworm  disease and associated PH. After increasing the dose of pimobendan (0.50 mg/kg,  q12h), the syncope subsided. However, syncope recurred on the 215th day of the  first episode. RESULTS: The findings that differed from those during the initial  examination were that cardiac arrest was observed for approximately 5 sec during  auscultation, along with sinus arrest. Therefore, to further investigate for  syncope, a Holter electrocardiograph was obtained for 3 days. Consequently, sinus  arrest was identified as the etiology of the recurrent syncope, and the patient  was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome, Rubenstein classification type II.  Following cilostazol (10 mg/kg, q12h) administration, the syncope subsided.  CONCLUSION: This case reports syncope in a dog, which typically occurs due to  different etiologies. When a dog has PH, it may be important to think about the  possibility of arrhythmias caused by a bigger right heart.","2022-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","440-446","","3","9","","J Adv Vet Anim Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © Journal of Advanced Veterinary and Animal Research.","","","","","","Place: Bangladesh PMID: 36382040  PMCID: PMC9597924","","","","Cilostazol; pimobendan; pulmonary hypertension; sick sinus syndrome; sinus arrest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Immunocompetent human hosts are usually  asymptomatically colonised or show subtle clinical signs, but some  immunocompromised people can develop florid life-threatening Pneumocystis  pneumonia (PCP). Since much less is known concerning Pneumocystis in dogs, we  posit the question: can Pneumocystis colonization be present in dogs with  inflammatory airway or lung disease caused by other pathogens or disease  processes? In this study, Pneumocystis DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid (BALF) of 22/255 dogs (9%) with respiratory distress and/or chronic cough.  Although young dogs (<1 year-of-age) and pedigree breeds were more often  Pneumocystis-qPCR positive than older dogs and crossbreds, adult dogs with other  infectious conditions and/or a history of therapy-resistant pulmonary disease  could also be qPCR-positive, including two patients with suppression of the  immune system. Absence of pathognomonic clinical or radiographic signs render it  impossible to convincingly discriminate between overt PCP versus other  lung/airway disease processes colonised by P. canis.

Because dog breeds are genetically  isolated populations, it is possible that IE is attributable to common founders  and is genetically homogenous within breeds. In humans, a number of mutations,  the majority of which are genes encoding ion channels, neurotransmitters, or  their regulatory subunits, have been discovered to cause rare, specific types of  IE. It was hypothesized that there are simple genetic bases for IE in some  purebred dog breeds, specifically in Vizslas, English Springer Spaniels (ESS),  Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs (GSMD), and Beagles, and that the gene(s) responsible  may, in some cases, be the same as those already discovered in humans. RESULTS:  Candidate genes known to be involved in human epilepsy, along with selected  additional genes in the same gene families that are involved in murine epilepsy  or are expressed in neural tissue, were examined in populations of affected and  unaffected dogs. Microsatellite markers in close proximity to each candidate gene  were genotyped and subjected to two-point linkage in Vizslas, and association  analysis in ESS, GSMD and Beagles. CONCLUSIONS: Most of these candidate genes  were not significantly associated with IE in these four dog breeds, while a few  genes remained inconclusive. Other genes not included in this study may still be  causing monogenic IE in these breeds or, like many cases of human IE, the disease  in dogs may be likewise polygenic.","2011-04-25","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","38","","","12","","BMC Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21518446  PMCID: PMC3111397","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Genetic Linkage; Microsatellite Repeats; Epilepsy/*genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate this point 57  dogs with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed chronic liver disease were  examined. Isoelectric focusing of blood serum from these dogs and from 25  clinically healthy dogs revealed three different types of alpha-1 antitrypsin,  designated F(fast), I(intermediate) and S(slow). They appeared in both homozygous  and heterozygous forms, the F type being seen most frequently. The I type was  more common in cocker spaniels than in other breeds. Immunostaining for alpha-1  antitrypsin revealed that 37 diseased dogs had alpha-1 antitrypsin in the  cytoplasm of their hepatocytes. Of these, 21 dogs had globular alpha-1  antitrypsin inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating aggregated  protein. Accumulated alpha-1 antitrypsin was found most frequently in dogs having  the I and S types of alpha-1 antitrypsin, either homozygously or heterozygously.  With a few exceptions, F-homozygotic dogs had no hepatocellular alpha-1  antitrypsin accumulation. As alpha-1 antitrypsin aggregation is lethal to  hepatocytes and as cell death attracts mononuclear blood cells whose cytokines  induce continued alpha-1 antitrypsin synthesis with subsequent risk of further  alpha-1 antitrypsin accumulation, liver disease may thus be maintained. Whether  alpha-1 antitrypsin aggregates actually initiate liver disease in dogs, as in  man, remains to be elucidated by further biochemical investigation of the three  canine alpha-1 antitrypsin types found.","1994-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","401-412","","4","111","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7884057","","","","Animals; Dogs; Phenotype; Chronic Disease; Dog Diseases/*metabolism; Immunohistochemistry; alpha 1-Antitrypsin/*analysis; Immunoelectrophoresis; Liver Diseases/metabolism/*veterinary; Liver/*chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neither the genetic abnormality nor the corresponding biochemical defect  have yet been identified. Unique abnormalities of visual cell structure, function  and renewal, however, characterize the disease phenotype and act as a marker for  the prcd gene. The disease was first described in miniature poodle dogs (MP) but  broadly similar retinal degenerations have been recognized, clinically, in other  breeds. Crossbreeding experiments with prcd-affected MP and retinal degenerate  English (ECS) and American (ACS) cocker spaniels now demonstrate that all the  progeny are affected with a retinal degeneration indistinguishable from prcd in  the MP. This indicates that the gene mutation in each breed is at the same (prcd)  locus. In purebred prcd-affected ECS (prcd-ECS), however, the disease phenotype  consistently differs from that in prcd-MP in its rate of progression and in the  topographical distribution of disease within the retina. Ultrastructural  variation in disease expression are also recognizable between the two phenotypes.  These differences in disease phenotype may be ascribable to different genetic  backgrounds in the two breeds, reflecting the effect of modifying genes, or may  indicate separate, allelic, mutations at the same locus.","1988-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","663-687","","5","46","","Exp Eye Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3164273","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Pedigree; Mutation; Phenotype; Microscopy, Electron; Crosses, Genetic; *Chromosome Mapping; Genetic Markers; Electroretinography; Retina/ultrastructure; Retinal Degeneration/genetics/physiopathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the  pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs in dogs was compared with the values  known for man. As in man, idiopathic epilepsy appeared to be more common than  symptomatic epilepsy in dogs. There was a preponderance of male vs. female  animals. When the breeds of the epileptic dogs were compared to the distribution  of breeds in the hospital population, breed-related differences in the prevalence  of epilepsy were found. The highest prevalence was seen in Cocker spaniels,  Miniature schnauzers, Collies and Bassets. The total prevalence of dogs with  epilepsy was 0.55%. Comparison of pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs showed  that some drugs were suited for maintenance therapy in dogs (primidone,  phenobarbital, ethosuximide, trimethadione) whereas others appeared not to be  ideally suited because of their short half-lives (phenytoin, carbamazepine,  valproic acid, diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam). This was confirmed by the  evaluation of antiepileptic drug efficacy in epileptic dogs. 46 dogs were treated  with primidone at daily doses of 14-104 mg/kg for 6-60 months. During medication  with primidone, effective plasma levels of its metabolite phenobarbital could be  maintained. Complete control of seizures or a reduction of seizure frequency by  at least 75% was achieved in 39% of the dogs at phenobarbital concentrations of  5-49 micrograms/ml.

The focus of work in many models of  veterinary behavioural medicine has predominantly been associated with reducing  activation of the protective emotional systems; in particular, fear-anxiety. The  management of the engaging emotional systems of desire-seeking, social play, care  and lust has not traditionally been considered in the treatment of physiological  health of veterinary species. This article reviews the literature in both  veterinary and human fields on the relationship between emotional arousal of both  protective and engaging emotional systems and physical health conditions. The  current literature describing the regulatory control of sleep on emotional  arousal is also discussed. An exemplary case report of a seven month old male  entire Cocker Spaniel showing fly-snapping behaviour which had been  non-responsive to leviteracetam (Keppra) is presented. The emotional health  assessment and treatment of this case is described along with the short and long  term (fourteen month follow up) outcomes to demonstrate that some patients  presenting in this way can be effectively managed with an appropriate behavioural  medicine treatment plan.

The disorder represents a rare clinical entity of  suspected congenital dyserythropoiesis and polymyopathy. Clinicopathologic  changes were similar to a previously reported syndrome of congenital  dyserythropoiesis, congenital polymyopathy, and cardiac disease in 3 related  English Springer Spaniel (ESS) dogs, but the dogs reported here did not have  apparent cardiac disease. INTERVENTIONS: Bone marrow aspiration,  electromyography, muscle biopsies, and an echocardiogram were performed on dog 1.  Results supported dyserythropoiesis and congenital polymyopathy similar to  reports in ESS dogs, but did not identify obvious cardiac disease.

Recent findings suggest that alteration of the basic sense of  self-awareness may be an essential distortion of schizophrenia spectrum  disorders. In addition, extensive research of social and mentalizing abilities  has stressed the role of distortion of social skills in schizophrenia.This  article aims to propose and support a concept of a triple brain network model of  the dysfunctional switching between default mode and central executive network  (CEN) related to the aberrant activity of the salience network. This model could  represent a unitary mechanism of a wide array of symptom domains present in  schizophrenia including the deficit of self (self-awareness and  self-representation) and theory of mind (ToM) dysfunctions along with the  traditional positive, negative and cognitive domains.

The skin that had been clipped for surgery was noticed to be  erythematous 8 days later. CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Poorly defined  patches containing multiple papules were visible bilaterally within the clipped  skin. These became larger over the following 2 weeks, and samples were collected  for histology. Seven days later, the lesions were multiple raised masses, up to 5  cm in diameter. Histology revealed numerous cup-shaped epidermal proliferations  extending into the dermis. The presence of keratinocytes with increased  quantities of blue-grey cytoplasm, and koilocytosis suggested papillomaviral  infection; Canis familiaris papillomavirus (CfPV-2) DNA was amplified from two  separate samples. Complete regression was observed 8 weeks after the lesions had  been initially observed. DIAGNOSIS: Multiple inverted papilloma confined to skin  that had been clipped for surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the first time  that the development of canine cutaneous papillomas has been associated with  surgery. The nature of the association between surgery and development of the  papillomas is uncertain. However, it is possible that damage to superficial skin  could promote the formation of papillomas.

Previous treatment had been initiated for suspected  lumbosacral intervertebral disk disease, however there was poor response to  therapy. On presentation the dog was laterally recumbent and neurological  examination revealed hyperesthesia over the lumbar vertebral segments. On survey  radiography there was loss of detail in the sublumbar fascial planes and  inconclusive lumbar vertebra proliferation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was  performed to better evaluate the lumbar spine and surrounding tissues, which  revealed extensive paralumbar cellulitis, abscessation and osteomyelitis with  extradural compression of the spinal cord. MR imaging allowed delineation of the  abscessed area, and distinct visualization of its extension into and involvement  of the surrounding tissues including muscle, fat, and retroperitoneal structures.  In this case, MR imaging was instrumental in defining the extent of the infection  and determining whether medical or surgical management of the diseased tissue was  necessary. If available, MR may be the imaging method of choice for evaluation of  paraspinal abscesses yielding a better insight to the spinal structures involved  and facilitating medical or surgical intervention.","2005-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","23-26","","1","46","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15693554","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; *Lumbar Vertebrae; Diagnosis, Differential; Abscess/pathology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/microbiology/*pathology/surgery; Spinal Cord Compression/pathology/veterinary; Spinal Diseases/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although its diet was supplemented, the puppy died 10 days after  birth. The renal pelves were enlarged and filled with urine. Both ureters were  thin throughout their length, and urine could not be expressed from either kidney  into its respective ureter. The bladder contained no urine and was firmly  embedded in the umbilicus. Histologically, both kidneys were hydronephrotic and  contained hypoplastic collecting tubules. The diameter of the right (0.55 mm) and  left (0.57 mm) ureters at the uteropelvic junction were narrower than those of an  age-matched control of the same breed (1.03 mm and 1.02 mm) and were lined by  hypoplastic urothelium. Trichrome staining of the ureters revealed excessive  collagen and disorganized smooth muscle fibers; in contrast, the control had  predominantly circular smooth muscle fibers and less fibrous tissue. Although  neither blood nor aqueous humor could be evaluated for urea nitrogen, we suspect  that the puppy died from uremia.

However,  unique clinical and/or laboratory findings like sporadic hemoglobinuria in  English Springer spaniels (PFK deficiency) may quickly point to the possibility  of an inherited erythrocyte enzyme defect. The ability to diagnose deficient or  carrier animals allows for the possibility of eliminating these undesirable  traits in future breeding.

METHODS: Sixteen readers representing four levels of experience evaluated 50 sets  of radiographs with varying severity of MR for presence or absence of HE, left  atrial enlargement (LAE) and HF. The performance of the readers was compared with  a reference standard, using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) curves. The interreader agreement value kappa (K) was  calculated. A subset of difficult cases of HF was analysed before and after  removing an outlying reader from each group. RESULTS: AUC for HE was 0.89, for  LAE it was 0.93 and for HF it was 0.92. Experience increased certainty of  diagnosis but not accuracy. K ranges were HE, 0.53 to 0.67; LAE, 0.61 to 0.69 and  HF, 0.49 to 0.58. When only difficult cases of HF were read, accuracy decreased  and experienced readers performed better than inexperienced. When outlying  readers were excluded, the differences between experienced and inexperienced  readers increased. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: LAE, not HE, should be used to evaluate  the heart size and indirectly the severity of MR on radiographs. For HF,  agreement among individual readers was only moderate.

The deficiency is inherited in an autosomal  recessive fashion and is clinically characterized by an increased susceptibility  to infection and renal disease. Despite having no detectable antigenic C3,  C3-deficient dog serum has approximately 10% of normal serum C3 hemolytic  activity. This report characterizes the nature of the C3-like activity in  C3-deficient dog serum. The activity is inhibited by heating serum to 56 degrees  C for 30 min and by incubation in 0.01 M EDTA. The activity is also sensitive to  both methylamine and D-76, in a dose-dependent fashion. The lytic activity in  C3-deficient dog serum appears to be complement mediated. Furthermore, lysis of  EAC1,4,oxy2 cells by deficient dog serum is inhibited by methylamine. Although  lysis is boosted by the addition of purified C5, a greater boost is obtained in  the absence of methylamine. Therefore, there exists a methylamine-sensitive  protein other than C4 in C3-deficient dog serum which interacts with C5. It is  possible that this protein may be a newly discovered complement protein for which  appropriate conditions for its detection have not previously been available.","1987","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","53-60","","1","4","","Complement","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 3105954","","","","Animals; Dogs; Kinetics; Cell Line; Complement C3/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency; Edetic Acid/pharmacology; Hemolytic Plaque Technique; Hot Temperature; Methylamines/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Myxomatous mitral valve disease affects many small breed dogs, and some breeds  such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Dachshunds, Yorkshire terriers, and  Miniature Schnauzers have been studied more in detail. Breed-specific information  regarding MMVD is valuable for providing appropriate advice on management and  breeding. Data, based on insurance statistics in Sweden, show that Chinese  Crested dogs (CCD) are twice as likely to visit the veterinarian for a  heart-related problem than other breeds. ANIMALS: One-hundred two privately  owned, healthy CCD were recruited via the Swedish CCD club. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, in which clinical  examinations, blood pressure measurements, and echocardiographic and Doppler  examinations were performed in all dogs. Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging was  performed in 87 dogs. RESULTS: Mitral regurgitation was present in 39 (38%) dogs,  whereas a systolic murmur was present in 35 (34%) dogs. Mitral valve prolapse was  present in 32 (31%) dogs. Tricuspid regurgitation was found in 29 (28%) dogs.  Dogs in the MR group were older (median 9.5 years), and males were  overrepresented compared with the non-MR group. Differences were also found  between groups regarding left atrial size and transmitral E wave velocity.  CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MR in CCD is similar to reports in other small  breeds. Whether the MR detected in these dogs is a sign of MMVD is unknown.","2023-03-16","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","55-61","","","46","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, in 109 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  (of which 61 were included in the three substudies mentioned above), the relation  between femoral artery pulse strength and presence of thrombocytopenia was  investigated. In 26% of the dogs, a pulse </=50% of normal strength was detected;  six dogs (2.0%) had an absent pulse unilaterally or bilaterally. Mitral valve  prolapse severity, degree of obesity, heart rate and age all influenced femoral  artery pulse strength negatively. Weak femoral artery pulses were not related to  clinical signs or to decreased pulse pressure or stroke volume. A weak femoral  artery pulse reflected reduced artery diameter and/or distension rather than  occlusion. In conclusion, weak femoral artery pulses in dogs with MMVD seem to be  associated with regional/local reductions in blood flow and not arteriosclerosis  or platelet count.","2004-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","113-120","","2","76","","Res Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 14672853","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Echocardiography, Doppler/veterinary; Electrocardiography/veterinary; Platelet Count/veterinary; Mitral Valve Prolapse/physiopathology/*veterinary; Blood Pressure/physiology; Aorta/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Blood Flow Velocity/veterinary; Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; Pulse/*veterinary; Thrombocytopenia/veterinary; Ultrasonography, Doppler/veterinary; Videotape Recording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control  study.

PROCEDURE: Effects of season, breed, sex, and  neutering on the risk of developing CPV enteritis were examined by calculation of  unadjusted odds ratios and performance of multivariate analysis. Stratified and  contingency table analyses were performed to identify interactions and  confounding among variables. RESULTS: Rottweilers, American Pit Bull Terriers,  Doberman Pinschers, and German Shepherd Dogs were at increased risk and Toy  Poodles and Cocker Spaniels were at decreased risk for developing CPV enteritis,  compared with that for mixed-breed dogs. For dogs more than 6 months old,  sexually intact males were twice as likely as intact females to develop CPV  enteritis. Dogs were 3 times more likely to be admitted with CPV enteritis in  July, August, and September, compared with the rest of the year. Dogs were 12.7  times more likely to be admitted with CPV enteritis if they had not been  currently vaccinated.

METHODS: This retrospective  study, based on a previous quantitative analysis in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB),  used 24 measurements taken on 130 T1-weighted MRI of hindbrain and cervical  region. Associated brachycephaly was estimated using 26 measurements, including  rostral forebrain flattening and olfactory lobe rotation, on 72 T2-weighted MRI  of the whole brain. Both study cohorts were divided into three groups; Control,  CM pain and SM and their morphometries compared with each other. RESULTS:  Fourteen significant traits were identified in the hindbrain study and nine  traits in the whole brain study, six of which were similar to the GB and suggest  a common aetiology. The Control cohort had the most elliptical brain (p = 0.010),  least olfactory bulb rotation (p = 0.003) and a protective angle (p = 0.004)  compared to the other groups. The CM pain cohort had the greatest rostral  forebrain flattening (p = 0.007), shortest basioccipital (p = 0.019), but a  greater distance between the atlas and basioccipital (p = 0.002) which was  protective for SM. The SM cohort had two conformation anomalies depending on the  severity of craniocervical junction incongruities; i) the proximity of the dens  (p <0.001) ii) increased airorhynchy with a smaller, more ventrally rotated  olfactory bulb (p <0.001). Both generated 'concertina' flexures of the brain and  craniocervical junction. CONCLUSION: Morphometric mapping provides a diagnostic  tool for quantifying symptomatic CM, secondary SM and their relationship with  brachycephaly. It is hypothesized that CM pain is associated with increased  brachycephaly and SM can result from different combinations of abnormalities of  the forebrain, caudal fossa and craniocervical junction which compromise the  neural parenchyma and impede cerebrospinal fluid flow.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0170315","","1","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28122014  PMCID: PMC5266281","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Phenotype; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Discriminant Analysis; Observer Variation; *Cephalometry; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/complications/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/genetics/pathology; Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/etiology/genetics/*veterinary; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Cervical Vertebrae/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Craniosynostoses/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*veterinary; Foramen Magnum/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Olfactory Bulb/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Rhombencephalon/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Skull Base/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Skull/*diagnostic imaging/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No patient has  required additional surgery to date, 94% (16/17) had some improvement in quality  of life after surgery, and none were judged to deteriorate to less than the  pre-surgical status. The authors conclude that this surgical procedure, combined  with medical therapy, resulted in favorable long-term outcomes.","2015-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","288-291","","3","56","","Can Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 25750451  PMCID: PMC4327144","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Dog Diseases/*surgery; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/surgery/*veterinary; Decompression, Surgical/methods/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Relapse-prone  outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to the  active (n=75) or control group (n=71). In the active arm, according to the  protocol, investigators were prompted to increase the antipsychotic dose upon  occurrence of a pharmacological inter vention requiring event (PIRE) detected by  ITAREPS. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis found no between-group  difference in the hospitalization-free survival rate at 12 months. However, the  trial suffered from high non-adherence of investigators in the active group, with  no antipsychotic dose increase in 61% of PIREs. Furthermore, Cox regression  analysis showed a 11-fold increased risk of hospitalization in the absence of  pharmacological intervention following a PIRE (hazard ratio [HR]=10.8; 95%  confidence interval [CI] 1.4-80.0; p=0.002). Therefore, a post-hoc as-treated  analysis was performed, which demonstrated a nine-fold reduction in the risk of  hospitalization in ITAREPS Algorithm-Adherers (IAAs, n=25) compared with the  ITAREPS Non-interventional group (INIs, n=70; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis,  HR=0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.28, p=0.009; number needed to treat [NNT]=4, 95% CI 3-10).  A significant difference in favor of the IAA group was seen in the number of  inpatient days (p<0.05) and costs (p<0.05).

The second dog's fecal incontinence was  associated with the anal mass. In both dogs, reconstruction of the external anal  sphincter was required to gain fecal continence. Especially in the dog with an  anal mass, the whole musculature involved in fecal continence was removed with  the affected anorectum. Conventional surgical treatments for fecal incontinence  have limitations in terms of muscle flap length and complexity of the surgical  procedure. A modified surgical technique using the semitendinosus muscle was  devised in the present study to overcome these limitations. The distal part of  the semitendinosus muscle was bifurcated to make two muscle bundles, used to  completely encircle the anorectum. These muscle bundles were sutured to the  surrounding rectal muscle and the pelvic diaphragm to simulate the function of  the external anal sphincter. Three months after surgery, both dogs showed  significantly improved fecal continence without severe complications, such as  infection, dehiscence, or lameness of the limb where the semitendinosus muscle  was harvested. The outcomes of the two dogs supported the acceptability of the  bifurcated muscle flap for anal sphincter augmentation. In addition, this report  showed the possibility of more diverse applications of semitendinosus muscle in  dogs.","2023-02-13","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","2","10","","Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36851454  PMCID: PMC9960280","","","","dog; muscle; anal mass; anal sphincter; augmentation; fecal incontinence; pull through; squamous cell carcinoma; transposition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: To reduce tissue  trauma, facilitate tissue handling and shorten the surgical time, shortening of  the eyelid was performed by excising a rectangular piece of the eyelid margin  only, in the central section, extending to but not below the first Hotz-Celsus  incision. The eyelid margin surgical wound was then sutured before excision of  the Hotz-Celsus crescent which had been surgically scored at the start of  surgery. Records of 31 dogs were reviewed for signalment, outcome, need for  further surgery, and follow up from 6 to 48 months after surgery. RESULTS:  Sixty-one eyes with lower lid entropion were treated. The most common breeds were  English bulldog and English cocker spaniel and the median age was 16 months. The  success rate for a single entropion correction surgery was 98.4%.

A six-year-old female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with a history of  lethargy and appetite loss. The dog was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis  based on hyperglycemia and renal glucose and ketone body loss. The dog's  condition improved on intensive treatment of diabetes mellitus; daily  subcutaneous insulin detemir injection maintained an appropriate blood glucose  level over half a year. However, the dog's body weight gradually decreased from  day 207, and on day 501, it presented with a decreased appetite; the precise  cause could not be determined. Based on mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia,  hypoadrenocorticism was suggested; the diagnosis was made using an  adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. Daily fludrocortisone with low-dose  prednisolone oral administration resulted in poor recovery of the blood chemistry  abnormalities; however, monthly desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) subcutaneous  injection with daily low-dose prednisolone oral administration helped in the  significant recovery of the abnormalities. Therefore, clinicians should consider  the possibility of coexistence of hypoadrenocorticism in dogs with diabetes  mellitus presenting with undifferentiated weight loss.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Two examiners performed gonioscopy in 98 eyes of 49 Welsh springer spaniel dogs  and estimated the percentage circumference of iridocorneal angle affected by  pectinate ligament abnormality to the nearest 5%. Percentage scores assigned to  each eye by the two examiners were compared. Inter-examiner agreement was  assessed following assignment of the percentage scores to each of four grading  schemes by Cohen's kappa statistic. RESULTS: There was a strong positive  correlation between the results of the two examiners (R=0·91). In general,  Examiner 1 scored individual eyes higher than Examiner 2, especially for eyes in  which both examiners diagnosed pectinate ligament abnormality. A ""good"" level of  agreement could only be achieved with a gonioscopy grading scheme of no more than  three categories and with a relatively large intermediate bandwidth (κ=0·68).  CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A three-tiered grading scheme might represent an  improvement on hereditary eye disease schemes which simply classify dogs to be  either ""affected"" or ""unaffected"" for pectinate ligament abnormality. However,  the large intermediate bandwidth of this scheme would only allow for the  additional detection of those dogs with marked progression of pectinate ligament  abnormality which would be considered most at risk of primary closed-angle  glaucoma.","2017-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","652-658","","11","58","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28869290","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis; Observer Variation; Gonioscopy/standards/*veterinary; Ligaments; Glaucoma/diagnosis/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors report the  first known case of acute upper airway obstruction resulting from retropharyngeal  hematoma in a dog. Documented causes in human medicine have included  coagulopathic states, trauma, infection, parathyroid adenoma rupture, and foreign  body ingestion. Vague symptoms in humans such as sore throat, shortness of  breath, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling may precede lethal airway  obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors report a case of an 18-month-old,  intact female water spaniel with thrombocytopenia that developed a massive  retropharyngeal hematoma and symptoms of airway compromise. The dog required  tracheal intubation followed by surgical tracheostomy. Lateral cervical  radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was consistent with a  retropharyngeal hematoma compromising the airway. The retropharyngeal hematoma  was managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: Retropharyngeal hematoma should be  considered in patients presenting with abrupt respiratory distress. Magnetic  resonance imaging allowed specific diagnosis of a rare condition that is  otherwise difficult to diagnose.","2015-10-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","257","","","11","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26452479  PMCID: PMC4600258","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Anaplasmosis/*complications; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/parasitology/*pathology; Hematoma/complications/etiology/pathology/*veterinary; Pharyngeal Diseases/pathology/*veterinary; Pharynx/pathology; Thrombocytopenia/complications/parasitology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tumour was  0.5 cm in diameter and macroscopically appeared as a single dermal mass, but  histopathological analysis identified it as a biphasic collision mixed tumour. In  the anatomically uniform tumour, 70% (4 mm in diameter) of the total parenchyma  was formed by a high-grade sarcoma (with the presence of giant cells), and about  30% of it (1 mm in diameter) was a malignant melanoma (again with the presence of  giant cells). The histologically distinct, but anatomically uniform tumour parts  were separated by a macroscopically invisible, non-neoplastic epithelial process  originating from the overlying hyperplastic epidermis. The two malignant  components did not infiltrate the peritumoural vessels and each other's  substance. In the sarcoma part, the mitotic and apoptotic indexes were 32 and 8,  respectively, whereas in the melanoma part the same parameters were 10 and 6,  respectively.

CLINICAL FINDINGS:  Physical examination revealed a tense abdomen, and the margins of a large  abdominal mass could be appreciated. Abdominal imaging revealed a mass of fat  opacity in the abdominal and thoracic cavities. Computed tomography with  precontrast and postcontrast peritoneograms was used to determine whether the  masses connected via a diaphragmatic defect. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Exploratory  laparotomy revealed a retroperitoneal lipomatous mass that had focally invaded  the hypaxial musculature and had extended across the dorsolateral aspect of the  diaphragm via the lumbocostal trigone into the intrathoracic extrapleural space.  Surgical resection required transdiaphragmatic thoracotomy. Histologic  examination of excised tissue confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of a lipoma.  The dog recovered from surgery with no complications and had no disease  recurrence for at least 32 months after surgical resection.

RESULTS: 152 dogs with odontogenic tumors or FFH were identified.  Sixty-eight (45%) dogs had CAA, 47 (31 %) had POF, 24 (16%) had FFH, and 13 (9%)  had other odontogenic tumors. Canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma was present most  commonly in the rostral aspect of the mandible, with POF and FFH more common in  the rostral aspect of the maxilla. Males and females were equally represented  among dogs with CAA and FFH. Castrated males were overrepresented among dogs with  POF. Golden Retrievers, Akitas, Cocker Spaniels, and Shetland Sheepdogs were  overrepresented among dogs with CAA. No breed predisposition was detected for FFH  or POF. Dogs with FFH had a greater mean age at initial evaluation than did dogs  with CAA or POF. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CAA, POF, and FFH have  distinct clinical patterns that may help clinicians and pathologists identify  such lesions more readily.","2011-02-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","495-500","","4","238","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21320020","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Odontogenic Tumors/pathology/*veterinary; Ameloblastoma/pathology/veterinary; Fibroma/pathology/veterinary; Gingival Hyperplasia/pathology/*veterinary; Sex Characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, breed variation  and white-coat effect have been tested by sampling three different dog breeds  both in their home and in a clinical setting. Short-term exercise increased  plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx) and von Willebrand factor (vWf). There was  significant difference between Pointers and the small dog breeds Cairn Terriers  and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the general plasma levels of vWf and  asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). NOx and vWf were significantly higher when  the sample was taken in the laboratory cf. at home, whereas ADMA and L-arginine  were significantly lower. In conclusion, both short-term exercise and white-coat  effect influence several plasma markers of endothelial function depending also on  the breed and gender of the dogs. These findings should be considered in future  studies concerning endothelial function in dogs.","2007-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","409-415","","3","82","","Res Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17092526","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Biomarkers; Gene Expression Regulation; Color; von Willebrand Factor/metabolism; Arginine/analogs & derivatives/blood; *Sex Characteristics; Alaska; Dogs/*classification/genetics/*physiology; Endothelium/*physiology; Enzyme Inhibitors/blood; Hair; Nitric Oxide/blood; Physical Conditioning, Animal/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a retrospective study, records of  hip-dysplasia screening of 69,349 dogs in 22 breeds that were born in 1988-1995  were analyzed and compared to data from prior to 1988. In most breeds, no  significant changes in dysplasia prevalence could be found. In English cocker  spaniels, golden and Labrador retrievers and Rottweilers a significant decrease -  but in boxers, Dobermans, German Shepherd dogs and rough collies a significant  increase - in prevalence was detected. In flat-coated retrievers overall  prevalence increased - but the prevalence of severe hip-dysplasia decreased  significantly during the study period. The present control program has not  resulted in fast progress. Selecting against hip-dysplasia cannot be expected to  be very effective, when based only on mass selection on phenotypic observations.  Predicted breeding values based on progeny testing would probably give better  results. Also, breeders' compliance and commitment to programs is not always high  and other selection criteria in breeding are thought to be more important. Modern  society has high demands for animal welfare and consumer issues, and breeders and  kennel societies should pay more attention to health issues in breeding pedigreed  dogs.","1999-10-31","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","121-131","","2","42","","Prev Vet Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 10551430","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Finland/epidemiology; Prevalence; Radiography; Mass Screening/veterinary; Breeding/economics; Hip Dysplasia, Canine/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN:  Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 62 cats and 31 dogs with cryptococcosis.  PROCEDURES: Medical records of cats and dogs with cryptococcosis were reviewed.  Information collected included geographic location, species, signalment, and  tissues or organs involved. Cryptococcosis was confirmed via serology, cytology,  histology, or microbial culture, and molecular typing was performed. Odds ratios  and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine significant  associations among variables. Other comparisons were evaluated via χ(2) or  unpaired t tests. RESULTS: American Cocker Spaniels were overrepresented,  compared with other dog breeds. Serum cryptococcal antigen test results were  positive in 51 of 53 cats and 15 of 18 dogs tested. Cryptococcus gattii was more  commonly detected in cats (7/9 for which species identification was performed),  and Cryptococcus neoformans was more commonly detected in dogs (6/8). Six of 7 C  gattii isolates from cats were molecular type VGIII. Distribution of involved  tissues was different between cats and dogs in California and between populations  of the present study and those of the previously reported Australian study.  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strains of Cryptococcus spp appeared to have  host specificity in dogs and cats. Differences in lesion distribution between  geographic locations may reflect strain differences or referral bias.

METHODS: A retrospective study  of 208 consecutive cases over a 48-month period from first-opinion practice.  RESULTS: Overall, 91 per cent of cases recovered with higher survival rates from  discrete foreign bodies (94 per cent in dogs and 100 per cent in cats) as opposed  to linear foreign bodies (80 per cent in dogs and 63 per cent in cats). English  bull terriers, springer spaniels, Staffordshire bull terriers, Border collies and  Jack Russell terriers were over-represented. In dogs, 63 per cent of obstructions  occurred in the jejunum but foreign objects were encountered at all points along  the gastrointestinal tract. A longer duration of clinical signs, the presence of  a linear foreign body and multiple intestinal procedures were associated with  significantly increased mortality. Neither the degree of obstruction (partial or  complete) nor the location of the foreign body was shown to have a significant  influence on survival. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Prompt presentation, diagnosis and  surgical intervention improve the outcome of gastrointestinal obstruction by  foreign bodies.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 1,196  dogs. PROCEDURES: Diagnostic reports of lingual biopsy specimens from dogs  evaluated from January 1995 to October 2004 were reviewed. RESULTS: Neoplasia  comprised 54% of lingual lesions. Malignant tumors accounted for 64% of lingual  neoplasms and included melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, and  fibrosarcoma. Large-breed dogs, especially Chow Chows and Chinese Shar-Peis, were  at increased risk for melanoma. Females of all breeds and Poodles, Labrador  Retrievers, and Samoyeds were more likely to have squamous cell carcinomas.  Hemangiosarcomas and fibrosarcomas were commonly diagnosed in Border Collies and  Golden Retrievers, respectively. Benign neoplasms included squamous papilloma,  plasma cell tumor, and granular cell tumor. Small-breed dogs, especially Cocker  Spaniels, were at increased risk for plasma cell tumors. Glossitis accounted for  33% of diagnoses; in most cases, the inciting cause was not apparent. Whereas  large-breed dogs were more likely to have lingual neoplasia, small-breed dogs  were more likely to have glossitis. Calcinosis circumscripta accounted for 4% of  lingual lesions and predominately affected young large-breed dogs. The remaining  submissions consisted mostly of various degenerative or wound-associated lesions.

BACKGROUND: Mitral valvular disease (MVD) has been extensively studied in  Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKC) but seldom studied and compared in other  small-breed dogs. The first clinical sign of MVD is the early appearance of a  left apical systolic heart murmur. ANIMALS: Nine hundred and forty-two adult dogs  were included in the present study (mean+/-SD, age=6.5+/-4.4 years,  weight=6.2+/-2.6kg). RESULTS: The average total prevalence of left apical  systolic heart murmur was 14.4% compared with 40.6% in CKC. It was significantly  more prevalent in males (18.5%) than in females (9.8%). Shi Tzu and Dachshunds  were the most affected breeds investigated. Most (81%) of the dogs with left  apical systolic murmur were classified in ISACHC heart failure class I.  CONCLUSION: This large retrospective study suggests that the prevalence of MVD is  higher in CKC than in the 6 small breeds investigated. Moreover, most of the dogs  do not develop congestive heart failure.","2006-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","11-18","","1","8","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19083332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ingested foreign bodies, which are not stopped in the mouth or  oesophagus, enter into the stomach. Once a foreign body has passed through the  pylorus, jejunum and ileum appear to be the most common sites of the small  intestine obstruction. The records of 103 cases, treated at the Clinic for  Surgery, Orthopaedics and Ophthalmology of the Veterinarian Faculty, University  of Zagreb from January 1981 till December 1998 were analysed. The analysis  included the incidence of ileus caused by foreign bodies and the distribution of  patients by sex, age, breed, duration of illness, site of obstruction, types of  foreign bodies and the interrelation between these parameters. The results of our  research show that the number of patients with foreign body induced ileus is  increasing. Males ingested foreign bodies more often than females. Foreign body  induced ileus was more frequently found in animals below 2 years of age. Foreign  bodies were mostly ingested by mongrels, but also by popular dog breeds such as  Dobermanns, Poodles, Cocker Spaniels and Rottweiler. Most of these ileus cases  were found in March and October and the predominant clinical signs included  anorexia, dehydration, abdominal tenderness and absence of defecation. The most  common site of small intestine obstruction by foreign bodies was the jejunum, and  the most effective treatment was enterotomy. Dogs mostly ingested stones, plastic  and rubber objects.

Neutered cats, all cat breeds except Domestic Shorthair, neutered dogs,  male dogs, intact male dogs, and small breed dogs had an increased risk for  calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Cystine and urate were found predominantly in male  dogs. Dalmatians were at highest risk for urate urolithiasis. The findings of  this study in the Netherlands were similar to findings in previous studies from  different countries.

Identification of genetic markers linked to joint laxity would foster  development of more accurate diagnostic methods, facilitate identification of the  disease gene(s), and supplement efforts to establish physical/genetic maps of the  canine genome. Work presented here describes analysis of randomly amplified  polymorphic DNA in the search for markers which cosegregate with increased joint  laxity in Canis familiaris, the domestic dog. The Boykin spaniel, a highly inbred  breed afflicted with an extremely high incidence of hip dysplasia, served as a  model for study of canine hip dysplasia. Only 5% of 200 random primers revealed  significant polymorphisms within this breed. However polymorphisms were detected  in seemingly nonpolymorphic amplification products when digested with restriction  enzymes. Restriction digestion revealed polymorphisms in 15% of the monomorphic  amplification products. Among the primers that revealed polymorphisms, one primer  correctly identified 9 of 12 dogs with regard to joint laxity. However, extensive  evaluation is required before any assertion can be made regarding linkage of this  marker to joint laxity. Of interest, another primer amplified a genomic segment  unique to the canine Y chromosome.","1999-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","99-103","","1","90","","J Hered","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9987913","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Phenotype; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary; *Genetic Markers; Hip Dysplasia, Canine/*genetics; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, it is crucial to identify critical time  points in disease progression, and if there are particular lesions associated  with specific aspects of neurologic dysfunction. Historical records of 53 canine  fucosidosis cases from 1979 to 2009 containing a neurologic dysfunction score  assessing motor, behavioral and sensory dysfunction were interrogated by  statistical analysis. Motor and behavioral dysfunction scores assessing gait  deficits and apprehensive behavior first significantly increased at 12-17 months,  and increased at each 6-month interval thereafter. Sensory dysfunction scores,  assessing hearing loss, balance and vision deterioration, did not significantly  increase until 18-23 months, and coincided with a rapid decline in neurologic  function. Regression analysis incorporating published neuropathology data,  measured by image analysis, identified neuroinflammation and apoptotic cell death  as significant informative predictors of increasing neurologic dysfunction. These  findings indicate that the level of neuropathology required to induce consistent  and conspicuous clinical signs in canine fucosidosis is reached by approximately  12 months of age in the absence of other disease processes. Significant  association between neuroinflammation and apoptotic cell death also suggests that  specifically targeting these lesions combined with enzyme replacement in future  studies may reduce disease burden in fucosidosis. Overall, examining this  historical clinical data to identify associations between the extent of  neuropathology and degree of clinical dysfunction provides a useful reference  tool for monitoring disease and evaluating therapeutic trials conducted in canine  fucosidosis.","2016-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","420-428","","4","15","","Genes Brain Behav","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26711085","","","","Animals; Dogs; Brain/pathology; Disease Models, Animal; Apoptosis/physiology; Clinical scoring system; CNS; Dog Diseases/metabolism/*physiopathology; fucosidosis; Fucosidosis/metabolism/physiopathology/*veterinary; lysosomal storage disease; Nervous System Diseases; neuropathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been reported to be a cutaneous marker of an  underlying systemic disease. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To assess the presence or  absence of concurrent systemic diseases associated with canine SNP and to  document breed predispositions. ANIMALS: Thirty nine dogs presented to a  veterinary teaching hospital from 1990 to 2012 which met inclusion criteria.  METHODS: Inclusion in this retrospective study required a diagnosis of SNP via  histopathological analysis and negative special stains for infectious organisms.  Breed distributions of affected dogs were compared to all other dogs examined at  this hospital during the study period. Correlations between the histological  pattern of panniculitis and the histological presence of dermatitis, clinical  presentation of lesions, dog breed and therapeutic outcomes were assessed.  RESULTS: Australian shepherd dogs, Brittany spaniels, Dalmatians, Pomeranians and  Chihuahuas were significantly over-represented, but correlations between  inflammatory patterns of panniculitis and other histological and clinical factors  were not identified. Based on the information available in medical records, 32  dogs (82.1%) had no concurrent systemic diseases identified. Four dogs had  concurrent polyarthritis, which may be related to SNP through unknown mechanisms.

Episodes are triggered by exercise,  stress or excitement and characterized by progressive hypertonicity throughout  the thoracic and pelvic limbs, resulting in a characteristic 'deer-stalking'  position and/or collapse. We used a genome-wide association strategy to map the  EFS locus to a 3.48 Mb critical interval on canine chromosome 7. By prioritizing  candidate genes on the basis of biological plausibility, we found that a 15.7 kb  deletion in BCAN, encoding the brain-specific extracellular matrix proteoglycan  brevican, is associated with EFS. This represents a compelling causal mutation  for EFS, since brevican has an essential role in the formation of perineuronal  nets governing synapse stability and nerve conduction velocity. Mapping of the  deletion breakpoint enabled the development of Multiplex PCR and Multiplex  Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) genotyping tests that can  accurately distinguish normal, carrier and affected animals. Wider testing of a  larger population of CKCS dogs without a history of EFS from the USA revealed  that carriers are extremely common (12.9%). The development of molecular genetic  tests for the EFS microdeletion will allow the implementation of directed  breeding programs aimed at minimizing the number of animals with EFS and enable  confirmatory diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of affected dogs.","2012-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","130-136","","1","45","","Neurobiol Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 156 dogs with  secondary glaucoma. PROCEDURES: Cause of glaucoma was determined from records.  Breed, age, sex, and neuter status of all dogs with secondary glaucoma were  compared with the general hospital population. The prevalence of secondary  glaucoma in dogs with a primary diagnosis of lens dislocation or anterior uveitis  during the same period was determined. RESULTS: Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed  in 156 of 2,257 (6.9%) dogs examined because of ophthalmic disease and was  bilateral in 33 (21.2%) of those dogs. In 31 (94%) bilaterally affected dogs, the  antecedent cause was the same in both eyes. Common causes of secondary glaucoma  were non-surgical anterior uveitis (44.9%), anterior uveitis associated with  prior phacoemulsification (15.8%), and lens dislocation (15.2%). Parson Russell  Terriers, Poodles, Boston Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and  Australian Cattle Dogs had diagnoses of secondary glaucoma more often than  expected, compared with the reference population. Age, sex, neuter status, and  laterality were not associated with secondary glaucoma. The prevalence of  secondary glaucoma in dogs with lens dislocation or uveitis was 15% or 17%,  respectively.

Of special interest was evaluation of  recurrence rate of cystine uroliths and adverse effects during long-term  tiopronin treatment. Twenty-six different breeds were recognized, and the most  common breeds were Dachshunds, Tibetan Spaniels, and Basset Hounds. In 76 of 88  treated dogs (86%), re-formation of cystine uroliths was prevented. Recurrence  rate of cystine uroliths changed from 7 months before to 18 months during  tiopronin treatment. On 28 occasions, bladder stones were found, and in about 60%  of the dogs, the uroliths dissolved. Quantitative measurement of the urinary  excretion of cystine showed a significantly (P < .03) higher excretion of cystine  in dogs with recurrent urolith formation than in dogs with only 1 urolith  episode. Another finding was a significant (P = .02) decrease in urinary cystine  excretion in older (>5 years) than in younger (<5 years) dogs. Adverse effects  were found in 11 dogs, and the most severe signs were aggressiveness and  myopathy. All signs disappeared when tiopronin treatment was stopped. In  conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of an individual strategy for  lifelong treatment of cystinuria. In addition to increasing water intake,  chemical modification of the cysteine molecule into a more soluble form by means  of tiopronin is useful. In dogs with re-formed cystine uroliths, dissolution may  be induced by increasing the tiopronin dosage to 40 mg/kg body weight per day. In  dogs with a low urolith recurrence rate and low urinary cystine excretion, the  tiopronin dosage may be decreased or treatment discontinued.","2001-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","361-367","","4","15","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11467594","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Male; Recurrence; Treatment Outcome; Dog Diseases/*drug therapy; Records/veterinary; Cystinuria/drug therapy/*veterinary; Drug Administration Schedule; Tiopronin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nutritional deficiencies are now uncommon as a result of the widespread feeding  of complete and balanced pet foods. Deficiencies of (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty  acids, zinc and vitamins, however, do arise in certain animal- or product-related  instances. Supraphysiologic doses of vitamin A have been used in the management  of vitamin A-responsive dermatosis in Cocker spaniels; other keratinization  defects and seborrheic conditions may respond to retinoid therapy. Much interest  has been paid to the therapeutic value of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements  in the management of dermatologic conditions associated with hypersensitivity  reactions or keratinization defects. These studies have generally yielded  disappointing results, which may reflect shortcomings in the design of some  trials. Nevertheless, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study has  demonstrated a clear benefit of high dose (n-3) fatty acids in the management of  pruritic skin disease. There is also preliminary experimental evidence that  specific dietary (n-6):(n-3) fatty ratios are useful in the dietary management of  inflammatory diseases. Although results of controlled clinical trials are  awaited, the argument exists that it is the absolute amount of (n-3) fatty acid  intake rather than ratio that is responsible for potential health benefits.","1998-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2783S-2789S","","12 Suppl","128","","J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9868266","","","","Animals; Dogs; *Dog Diseases; Cats; Dietary Supplements; *Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; *Cat Diseases; *Diet; Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage; Fatty Acids, Essential; Skin Diseases/etiology/*veterinary; Vitamins/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs with clinical signs, tested for EPI by  radioimmunoassay of serum cTLI, were used. METHODS: In this retrospective study,  results of 13,069 cTLI assays were reviewed. RESULTS: An association with EPI was  found in Chows, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), Rough-Coated Collies  (RCC), and German Shepherd Dogs (GSD) (all P < .001). Chows (median, 16 months)  were younger at diagnosis than CKCS (median, 72 months, P < .001), but not  significantly different from GSD (median, 36 months, P = .10) or RCC (median, 36  months, P = .16). GSD (P < .001) and RCC (P = .015) were younger at diagnosis  than CKCS. Boxers (P < .001), Golden Retrievers (P < .001), Labrador Retrievers  (P < .001), Rottweilers (P = .022), and Weimaraners (P = .002) were  underrepresented in the population with EPI. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL  IMPLICATIONS: An association with EPI in Chows has not previously been reported.  In breeds with early-onset EPI, immune-mediated mechanisms are possible or the  disease may be congenital. When EPI manifests later, as in CKCS, pathogenesis is  likely different (eg, secondary to chronic pancreatitis). Underrepresentation of  certain breeds among dogs with EPI has not previously been recognized and may  imply the existence of breed-specific mechanisms that protect pancreatic tissue  from injury.","2007-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","207-214","","2","21","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17427378","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Sex Characteristics; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The animals' clinical  records were reviewed retrospectively and certain risk factors were compared with  a control population of 3407 dogs. Twenty-two of the 23 dogs were from south-east  England and dogs from Surrey (n=8) were significantly overrepresented. There were  also significantly more Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n=5) and Staffordshire  bull terriers (n=5) among the affected dogs than in the control group. The median  age of affected dogs was 10 months (range five to 90 months). The most common  presenting signs were cough (65 per cent), dyspnoea (43 per cent), haemorrhagic  diathesis (35 per cent) and collapse (26 per cent). Four dogs were  thrombocytopenic and eight had significant prolongations in prothrombin time  and/or activated partial thromboplastin time. Thoracic radiographs were abnormal  in 18 of 19 dogs. A variety of changes were observed, the most typical being a  patchy alveolar-interstitial pattern affecting the dorsocaudal lung fields.  Angiostrongylus vasorum larvae were found in seven of 10 bronchoalveolar lavage  specimens and 19 of 19 faecal samples. Three dogs died shortly after admission to  the hospital. The remainder were successfully treated with fenbendazole at a dose  of 50 mg/kg for five to 21 days.

Comparisons with color  Doppler echocardiography and phonocardiography were made, and the effects of 2  physical maneuvers on the auscultatory findings were evaluated. Using mildly  diseased dogs, interobserver agreement in diagnosing the presence or absence of  left-sided murmurs ranged from 63% to 88%. The agreement with phonocardiography  (range, 53-91%) increased with the amount of observer experience. The 2 most  experienced observers could discern soft ejection murmurs from regurgitant  murmurs and were able to diagnose 89% of the dogs with regurgitant jets larger  than 30% of the left atrial area. In general, less experienced observers  diagnosed most jets larger than 50%. In many dogs with small jets, no murmur was  found by auscultation and phonocardiography. The audibility of mild regurgitation  was significantly reduced in dogs that were difficult to auscultate. Early  systolic murmurs were typical of mild regurgitation, whereas holosystolic murmurs  typified severe regurgitation. In a few dogs, late systolic murmurs alternated  with holosystolic murmurs. Systolic clicks were found phonocardiographically in  18 dogs with mild to moderate regurgitation, but the audibility apparently was  low. In many mildly affected dogs, physical maneuvers increased murmur intensity.  Thus, some form of dynamic auscultation might facilitate the diagnosis of mild  regurgitation. Auscultatory findings in mild regurgitation appear to depend on  observer experience, circulatory status, and how difficult the dog is to  auscultate.","1999-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","56-64","","1","13","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10052065","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Mitral Valve/physiopathology; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis; *Observer Variation; Veterinarians; Echocardiography, Doppler, Color/veterinary; Heart Auscultation/methods/*veterinary; Heart Murmurs/diagnosis/veterinary; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/diagnosis/*veterinary; Phonocardiography/veterinary; Running/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A ""severe"" attack was defined as one in which the dog ""repeatedly  bit or vigorously shook its victim, and the victim or the person intervening had  extreme difficulty terminating the attack."" Information from health department  records was clarified by interviews with animal control officers, health and  police officials, and persons with firsthand knowledge of the events.  Investigation disclosed that the dogs involved in the 16 severe attacks were  reproductively intact males. The median age of the dogs was 3 years. A majority  of the attacks were by American Staffordshire terriers, St. Bernards, and cocker  spaniels. Ten of the dogs had been aggressive toward people or other dogs before  the incident that was investigated. Ten of the 16 victims of severe attacks were  10 years of age or younger; the median age of all 16 victims was 8 years. Twelve  of the victims either were members of the family that owned the attacking dog or  had had contact with the dog before the attack. Eleven of the victims were bitten  on the head, neck, or shoulders. In 88 percent of the cases, the attacks took  place in the owner's yard or home, or in the adjoining yard. In 10 of the 16  incidents, members of the victims' families witnessed the attacks. The  characteristics of these attacks, only one of which proved fatal, were similar in  many respects to those that have been reported for other dog bite incidents that  resulted in fatalities. On the basis of this study, the author estimates that a  risk of 2 fatalities per 1,000 reported dog bites may exist nationwide.  Suggestions made for the prevention of severe attacks focus on changing the  behavior of both potential canine attackers and potential victims.","1985-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","55-61","","1","100","","Public Health Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3918325  PMCID: PMC1424716","","","","Animals; Humans; Female; Male; Child, Preschool; *Dogs; Adult; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Aged; Bites and Stings/*epidemiology/prevention & control; Child; South Carolina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of the development and  extinction of cardiac and respiratory orienting reflexes (O.R.) in these two  types of dogs indicates that the LA dogs exhibit higher frequency and more  intensive, persistent, and highly fluctuating (poorly modulated) cardiac and  respiratory O.R.s than those exhibited by the HA dogs, which show rapid O.R.  habituation and good modulation.

METHODS:  Computed tomography and radiographs were obtained for both elbows of 14 dogs with  unilateral HCF. The images were evaluated by two boarded radiologists and the  prevalence of IOHC in the limb contralateral to the HCF was identified.  Sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic diagnosis of IOHC were  determined. RESULTS: Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle was present  in six of 14 dogs, however IOHC was incomplete in three of the six affected dogs.  Plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 0.83 (CI 95%: 0.36 to 0.99) and  specificity of 1 (CI 95%: 0.60 to1). The Kappa coefficient between radiologists  for radiographic examination was 0.714. Of the Spaniel breeds, four out of eight  had IOHC in the limb contralateral to the HCF. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Computed  tomography evaluation is more sensitive than radiographs for diagnosis of IOHC,  particularly when assessing partial or incomplete IOHC. However, sensitivity of  radiographic diagnosis is good and should be adequate in most cases. Clinical  suspicion of IOHC in the contralateral limb to the unilateral HCF should be  present; however overall frequency may not be as high as previously reported.","2010","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","168-172","","3","23","","Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 20422122","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Forelimb/*pathology; Radiography; Dog Diseases/etiology; Humeral Fractures/complications/*veterinary; Joint Diseases/*complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eleven of the dogs  were boxers and the other breeds affected were a Pharaoh hound, rottweiler,  springer spaniel and a greyhound. The condition was bilateral in three cases.  Eleven dogs were treated surgically by cast immobilisation (four cases), fragment  removal (one case), lag screw fixation (three cases), pan-carpal arthrodesis (one  case) and lag screw reduction followed by pan-carpal arthrodesis (two cases). The  remaining four dogs were treated conservatively with rest and tactical use of  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Follow-up periods ranged from two months  to 11 years. Varying degrees of lameness, which tended to be exacerbated by  exercise, persisted in all cases. The radial carpal bone appears to have at least  three separate centres of ossification which eventually fuse; their planes of  fusion correspond approximately to the two main fracture lines. These areas of  fusion could be weak points within the radial carpal bone.","2000-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","74-79","","2","41","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10701191","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use; Carpal Bones/*pathology; Fractures, Closed/pathology/rehabilitation/*veterinary; Immobilization; Internal Fixators; Radius Fractures/pathology/rehabilitation/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present  study is a comprehensive, up-to-date statistical investigation on the type,  frequency and breed distribution of neoplasia in dogs in Germany. The  histopathological datasets of 109,616 German canine tissue samples (2014-2019)  were processed and statistically examined in retrospect. Non-neoplastic diseases  were found in 38,650 samples (35.3%) and 70,966 neoplasms (64.7%) were diagnosed.  The most common neoplasms were mammary tumours (21.9%), benign epithelial skin  tumours (15.4%), mast cell tumour (9.7%), histiocytoma (7.0%), soft tissue  sarcoma (5.8%), lipoma (5.8%), melanocytic tumours (5.2%) and odontogenic tumours  (4.7%). In general, Beagles, Magyar Vizslas, Boxers, Schnauzers, Spaniels, French  Bulldogs and Golden Retrievers had an increased risk of neoplasia (odds ratio  1.17-1.46; all: P ≤0.001) compared with crossbreed dogs. In particular, Boxers,  Golden Retrievers, Rottweilers and Schnauzers were often affected by malignant  neoplasms, whereas some breeds (eg, West Highland White Terrier, Magyar Vizsla,  Chihuahua, Dachshund and Yorkshire Terrier) were frequently affected by numerous  benign tumour types. Despite the known risk of haemangiosarcoma in German  Shepherd Dogs, other malignant tumours were rare in this breed. Depending on the  type of tumour, some purebred dog breeds can have an increased, reduced or  identical risk for certain neoplasms compared with crossbreeds. Discussion of  breed predispositions to tumour diseases must therefore be conducted critically  and with a view to clinical relevance.","2022-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","33-55","","","198","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to determine ACE gene variant-positive  prevalence in a population of 497 dogs of different breeds. RESULTS: Overall  variant-positive prevalence was 31%, with 20% of dogs heterozygous and 11% of  dogs homozygous. The variant was overrepresented in Irish Wolfhounds (prevalence  95%; P < .001), Dachshunds (prevalence 90%; P < .001), Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels (prevalence 85%; P < .001), Great Danes (prevalence 84%; P < .001), and  Bull Mastiffs (prevalence 58%; P = .02). Irish Wolfhounds were more likely to be  homozygous than heterozygous (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-third of dogs in  this study were positive for a functionally important ACE gene variant, with wide  prevalence variability between breeds. The clinical importance of high ACE gene  variant-positive prevalence in some breeds requires further study because the  highest prevalences were found in breeds that are predisposed to heart disease  and therefore may be treated with ACE-inhibitors.","2021-07-13","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","6","","1","8","","Canine Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

HYPOTHESIS: The risk of cardiac death is higher in certain  breeds and mortality varies by age and sex. DOGS: Dogs that were life insured by  an animal insurance company between 1995 and 2002. METHODS: The mortality pattern  for heart disease in insured dogs up to 10 years of age was studied. The  influences of sex, age, breed, month, and geographic location were investigated  by means of incidence rates, proportions, and survival proportions. Cox  proportional hazards regression was used to model time to heart disease. RESULTS:  405,376 dogs contributed to a denominator of 1,431,933 dog-years at risk (DYAR)  and 3,049 dogs had been assigned a cardiac-related diagnosis as cause of death.  The cardiac-related mortality for dogs <10 years of age, was 21.3 deaths per  10,000 DYAR. This mortality in males and females was 27.3 deaths and 15.4 deaths  per 10,000 DYAR, respectively.

This  possibility was tested in a large-animal model using mixed allogeneic chimeras  established using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and donor-specific bone marrow  transplantation (BMTX). Four recipient sex-mismatched and DLA class II-matched  English springer spaniels became chimeric after TLI and donor-specific BMTX.  Subsequent donor-specific renal allografts survived for more than a year.  Acceptance of a donor-specific skin graft and rejection of a third-party graft  demonstrated tolerance with maintenance of immunocompetence. Pancreatic  microfragments containing islets were refluxed into the splenic vein of the  recipient. Purified islets were placed under the capsule of spleen and liver.  After 75 days, recipients underwent total native pancreatectomy. All four  chimeric pancreatectomized dogs had functioning islet grafts 75 days after  transplantation, evidenced by a prompt rise in serum insulin levels following an  IVGTT and histological demonstration of islet tissue at the site of  transplantation. After removal of the transplanted islet tissue, no insulin was  released after IVGTT. In summary, intrasplenic allogeneic canine islets  transplanted into chimeric dogs rendered tolerant to donor MHC survive and  function for greater than 75 days in the absence of immunosuppression. This study  represents proof of the concept that allogeneic islet transplants have the  potential to reverse diabetes without the use of conventional immunosuppression.","2000-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","877-887","","6","9","","Cell Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11202573","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Spleen; In Vitro Techniques; Amylases/blood; Glucose Tolerance Test; Graft Rejection/immunology/pathology; Graft Survival/immunology; Immune Tolerance/*immunology; Insulin/blood; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/*immunology; Kidney Transplantation/immunology; Models, Animal; Pancreatectomy; Transplantation Chimera/*immunology; Transplantation, Homologous/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Case-control. DOGS: 103 Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels, 27 normal individuals and 76 with varying degree of MR.  PROCEDURE: Dogs were evaluated by physical examination, collection of venous  blood, thoracic radiography and echocardiography. NT-proANP, ANP and BNP were  measured in plasma using radio immunoassay (RIA). RESULTS: The mean  concentrations of NT-proANP were 37.4 and 83.5 times higher than ANP and BNP,  respectively. The mean ANP to BNP molar ratio was 2.6. Plasma concentrations of  NT-proANP and ANP were slightly increased in asymptomatic dogs with increased  cardiac dimensions; those with signs of decompensated heart failure (HF) had mean  concentrations of NT-proANP and ANP 3 to 7 times higher than normal dogs. The BNP  concentrations were increased only in dogs with decompensated HF and the levels  were approximately twice as high in these dogs as in normal individuals.  Univariate and multiple regression analysis showed that primarily left atrial and  ventricular size influenced the plasma concentrations of all 3 peptides  (increased with increasing measurement). Analyses of response operating  characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that NT-proANP and ANP were more  discriminating than BNP for either cardiomegaly of HF. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:  Natriuretic peptides, particularly NT-proANP and ANP, may be of benefit in the  overall assessment of dogs with naturally occurring MR. Analysis of NT-proANP may  be more useful than ANP owing to easier handling of the samples and less  laborious assay.","2000-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","7-16","","1","2","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19081325","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PRA  shows genetic heterogeneity, as does RP, with several distinct forms already  recognized and several more remaining to be investigated. Progress in molecular  genetics has allowed the identification of the gene mutation responsible for an  early onset form of PRA in the Irish setter, classified as rod-cone dysplasia  type 1. The gene involved is the beta-subunit of cyclic guanosine monophosphate  phosphodiesterase which encodes a protein of the visual transduction cascade.  Investigation of this gene in other breeds of dog with PRA has failed to find  further breeds with the same mutation. Other genes that have been investigated  include those encoding other proteins in the visual transduction cascade and for  photoreceptor specific structural proteins. Further disease causing mutations  have not yet been identified. Recently, developments in the mapping of the canine  genome have produced sufficient markers to allow preliminary mapping of PRA  genes. Already linkage to the most common form of PRA, progressive rod-cone  degeneration (prcd), has been established. prcd occurs in poodles, cocker  spaniels and Labrador retrievers and possibly other breeds. The prcd-linked  marker should enable development of a DNA-based test for the disease locus and  facilitate identification of the actual disease causing gene mutation. Over the  next few years we can look forward to the identification of several more  PRA-causing gene mutations. This article will review research that seeks to  characterize PRA in the dog, identify the responsible gene mutations, and  elucidate the disease processes involved.","1998-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","5-18","","1","155","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9455155","","","","Animals; Dogs; Mutation; Chromosome Mapping/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*genetics/*pathology; Retina/*pathology; Models, Genetic; Atrophy; Retinal Diseases/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Retinitis Pigmentosa/genetics/pathology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five of these  eight (including two anchor loci) showed diallelic restriction fragment length  polymorphisms in a large kindred of Brittany spaniels and could be used for  segregation studies. Several probes chosen from different human chromosomes also  were unlinked in the dog. By contrast, linkage was found between the canine  counterparts of the closely linked human serum amyloid A gene family. Three  markers linked on human chromosome II appeared not to be syntenic in the dog. DNA  markers linked to various human genetic neuromuscular diseases were not linked to  hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy which segregates in this kindred.  However, there was evidence of possible linkage of this disorder with a canine  counterpart of the tyrosinase gene.

Dog 1 was transferred to  hospital from a local hospital in a haemorrhagic shock state with uncontrolled  continuous bleeding. Thoracic radiographs revealed multiple nodular shadows  suspected to be pulmonary metastasis. Dog 2 presented with intermittent bleeding  from a mass lesion in the right fifth mammary gland. Due to high anaesthetic risk  secondary to severe mitral valve insufficiency (ASA status III), the owner  declined surgical excision of the tumour. Therefore, microwave ablation (MWA)  under local anaesthesia was chosen in order to achieve adequate haemostasis. Both  dogs received local anaesthesia around the bleeding mass lesion, and the  disintegrated site was microwave-ablated; dog 1 underwent MWA after blood  transfusion to improve the haemorrhagic shock. The ablation site was protected  using a non-adhesive dressing. Scarring of the ulcerated site led to complete  haemostasis in both cases. Dog 1 underwent tumorectomy on the 31st hospital day  to prevent rebleeding; histopathology results were consistent with mammary  adenocarcinoma with the ablation site covered by a capsule structure. To the  authors' knowledge, this is the first case report describing the use of MWA to  stop bleeding from mammary tumours in veterinary medicine. MWA is a feasible and  potentially effective palliative treatment modality to stop bleeding from  disintegrated mammary tumours in dogs under local anaesthesia.","2023-02-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","","","","Vet Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

A 7-year-old intact male  American cocker spaniel that had undergone removal of a nictitating gland was  referred for severe ulcerative keratitis. Slit-lamp examination showed swelling  of the eyelid, mucopurulent discharge, conjunctival injection and chemosis,  diffuse corneal edema and opacity, and a deep ulcer in central cornea. Gram  staining of discharge from the eye demonstrated Gram-positive cocci. Despite  topical ofloxacin, oxytetracycline and polymyxin B ophthalmic solution and  intravenous cefazolin, there was no improvement. Cultures revealed MRSA that was  sensitive only to chloramphenicol, vancomycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin. The  antibiotic regimen was changed to topical and systemic chloramphenicol. After 9  days of treatment, although inflammation started to be resolved, the dog  developed nonregenerative anemia. The antimicrobial regimen was changed again to  topical and systemic vancomycin. Inflammation continued to improve over the next  week. MRSA should be considered a potential organism in infectious keratitis,  especially when general antibiotics are not effective. Although topical and  systemic chloramphenicol and/or vancomycin are effective for treating MRSA  keratitis, vancomycin should only be used when culture and susceptibility results  indicate it is appropriate and no other options are available. To our knowledge,  this is the first detailed case report of MRSA keratitis in a dog.","2013-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","240-243","","3","16","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23127159","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use; Chloramphenicol/therapeutic use; Dog Diseases/drug therapy/*microbiology; Keratitis/drug therapy/microbiology/*veterinary; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*isolation & purification; Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/microbiology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Retrospective single-centre case  review. RESULTS: Ischaemic infarction in the territory of the rostral cerebellar  artery was identified in three spaniel-breed dogs. All cerebellar infarcts were  non-haemorrhagic. Telencephalic infarcts were identified in five dogs, in the  territories of the middle cerebral artery (2/5) and rostral cerebral artery  (3/5). One of these dogs had an ischaemic infarction, but all other infarctions  appeared haemorrhagic. All dogs were geriatric (≥ 8 years old), with concurrent  medical conditions identified in six dogs. One dog was euthanased after diagnosis  because of the severity of its neurological signs and one dog was euthanased as a  result of associated renal disease 2 months after diagnosis. Six dogs were alive  at least 1 year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: CT is useful in the diagnosis of  cerebrovascular accident in dogs, which can present as a spectrum of images with  early changes in attenuation and subtle mass effects detected after infarction.  CT is particularly sensitive for detecting haemorrhagic infarction, but  under-represent ischaemic and lacunar infarctions when compared with MRI.","2010-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","374-380","","10","88","","Aust Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","© 2010 The Authors.

Deutsche tierarztliche Wochenschrift","","0341-6593","","","Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart disease which is often found in humans and animals. The age of onset of this progressive disease varies between 3 and 7  years of age. A juvenile form of DCM has been found in Portuguese Water Dogs and  Doberman Pinscher Dogs. Some breeds such as Doberman pinscher, Newfoundland,  Portuguese Water dog, Boxer, Great Dane, Cocker Spaniel and Irish Wolfhound  exhibit a higher prevalence to DCM. There also seems to be a sex predisposition  as male dogs are affected more often than female dogs and in Great Danes an  X-linked recessive inheritance is likely. In Newfoundland and Boxer an autosomal  dominant inheritance was found whereas an autosomal recessive inheritance was  described in Portuguese Water Dogs. Atrial fibrillation as a cause or consequence  of DCM is assumed for certain breeds. The causes of DCM are widely unknown in  dogs. A genetic basis for this heart disease seems to exist. Apart from a few  exceptions the mode of inheritance and the possible underlying gene mutations are  not known for DCM in dogs. In humans mutations in several genes responsible for  DCM have been identified. Comparative genetic analyses in dogs using genes  causing DCM in men and a genome-wide scan with anonymus markers were not able to  detect causative mutations or genomic regions harboring gene loci linked to DCM.  The investigation of the genetic basis of canine DCM may lead to new insights  into the pathogenesis of DCM and may result in new therapeutic approaches and  breeding strategies.","2005-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","380-385","","10","112","","Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 16320572","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Male; Echocardiography/veterinary; Mutation; Sex Factors; Prognosis; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The dogs (a Golden Retriever, an English Cocker  Spaniel, and two Tibetan Mastiffs) were supplemented daily with selenium (Se)  (0.6 mg/kg organic Se yeast) and vitamin E (vit. E) (5 mg/kg) per os for 60 days.  Semen was collected on days 0, 30, 60, and 90. The sperm concentration and  motility parameters were evaluated by the CASA system, sperm morphology was  explored by Diff-Quick staining, and live and dead spermatozoa were  differentiated by eosin/nigrosin staining. The concentrations of Se and vit. E  were measured in peripheral blood serum on semen collection days. RESULTS: Before  administration, the concentrations of Se in blood plasma were low (86.0-165.0  μg/L). After 30 days of treatment there was an observable improvement in total  and progressive sperm motility and kinematic parameters (VAP, VSK, VCL, ALH, BCF,  and RAPID). The percentages of live and normal morphology sperm cells were also  higher. There was also an observable increase in Se and vitamin E concentrations  in blood serum. Bitches were successfully mated and delivered four to six  puppies. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with Se and vit.

To this end, measurements of HR, f and Tb were performed weekly, on  two consecutive days, for the first two postnatal months on puppies of three  breeds of dogs (Rottweiler, Cocker Spaniel and Carlino dogs) with very different  birth weights and postnatal growth patterns. Ambient conditions and feeding  habits were constant for all puppies. The results indicated that (1) the 24-h  average Tb increased and average HR and f decreased with growth, (2) the daily  rhythms in Tb were apparent by 4 weeks, irrespective of the puppy's growth  pattern, (3) the daily rhythm of Tb in the puppy was not necessarily following  that of the mother; in fact, it could anticipate it. (4) The daily rhythms in HR  and f were not apparent for the whole study period. We conclude that in neonatal  dogs the onset of the daily rhythms of Tb has no obvious relationship with body  size or rate of growth and is not cued by the maternal Tb rhythm.

Sperm head  morphology was examined in Giemsa-stained smears by light microscopy, using a  computer-assisted image analyzer and by transmission electron microscopy. We  found significant variation in sperm head area, length, width and degree of  roundness among normospermic individual dogs, indicating that it would be  necessary to examine many more dogs before the size and shape of normal dog  spermatozoa could be determined. The normospermic dogs were used as controls for  the teratozoospermic cases. Case 1: A 2-yr-old subfertile Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel had semen with small and narrow-based sperm heads and a proximal  cytoplasmic droplet in most of the spermatozoa. With the image analysis system,  sperm heads were shown to be smaller and more oval than in normospermic dogs. The  variatons in size and shape were similar in magnitude to those of control dogs.  An examined infertile half-brother had similar semen quality. Case 2: A 3-yr-old  Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen with 2 unsuccesfull matings exhibited spermatozoa  with severe abnormalities. Measured by image analyzer, sperm heads were irregular  in shape and very small in area. One of the two littermates examined had semen of  the same quality as the case dog. Case 3: A 3-yr-old fertile Golden Retriever had  semen with giant sperm heads in about 50% of spermatozoa. Image analyzing results  revealed 2 populations of different sized sperm heads.

STUDY DESIGN: Controlled clinical study. ANIMALS: Dogs  with HIF (14 dogs, 21 elbows) and dogs without HIF (20 dogs, 31 elbows). METHODS:  A caudo-medial arthroscope portal was used to inspect all elbow joints.  Arthroscopic features of 21 joints of dogs with HIF were compared with 31 control  elbows of HIF- negative dogs. RESULTS: All elbows with HIF showed a focal  cartilage lesion on the caudal aspect of the humeral condyle. The lesions ranged  from a simple indentation into the articular surface to a full thickness  cartilage erosion. Humero-anconeal incongruity was identified in all elbows with  HIF as absence of joint space at the point of contact between the tip of the  anconeal process and the cartilage lesion, with a wider joint space distally  within the ulnar trochlear notch. None of the elbows without HIF showed the  cartilage lesion or evidence of humero-anconeal incongruity. CONCLUSION: Use of a  novel arthroscope portal allowed description of a previously unreported cartilage  lesion on the caudal humeral condyle of dogs with HIF. The lesion was found in  all dogs with HIF but in no dogs without HIF. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:  Humero-anconeal incongruity and an associated cartilage lesion appear to be  present in dogs with HIF. We propose that this lesion may be associated with  humero-anconeal incongruity. This may be considered as a possible future  therapeutic target for HIF.","2022-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","117-124","","1","51","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

This report documents the 18-month survival of a dog with multiple anomalies including  atresia ani. An 18-month-old black Cocker Spaniel bitch was presented for  evaluation of prolapsed glands of the third eyelid involving both the eyes.  Clinical examination revealed a single perineal opening, fecal matter in the  vestibule, distended abdomen, hypoplastic vulva, and the absence of a tail  without any neurological deficits. Abdominal contrast radiography revealed a  distended colon with fecal stasis, rectovestibular fistula, termination of the  rectum as a blind pouch, lumbar scoliosis due to block vertebrae, and the  presence of only two hypoplastic coccygeal vertebrae. The case was diagnosed as  atresia ani type II with rectovestibular fistula, hypoplastic vulva, lumbar  scoliosis, and anury, in the global context of a caudal regression syndrome. The  wide aperture fistula, connected to the vestibule, undamaged spinal cord and  sacrum without any neurological deficits were the favorable prognostic factors  that maintained continence and allowed the dog to survive to adult life with  these anomalies. Thus, an appropriate bowel management program and specialty care  can improve the quality of life and longevity of this animal.","2021-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","252-258","","350","105","","Morphologie","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Escherichia coli  was also diagnosed on the basis of results of urine culture. TREATMENT AND  OUTCOME Despite treatment of the UTI with an appropriate antimicrobial for 6  weeks, the VUR persisted and the UTI recurred 9 weeks after cessation of  antimicrobial treatment. Therefore, surgical correction by means of revision  extravesicular ureteroneocytostomy was performed. Both VUR and hydronephrosis  resolved after surgery. No recurrences of clinical signs of urinary tract  complications were observed during the subsequent 22-month follow-up period.

Cryopreserved denuded amniotic  membranes (obtained from Miniature Dachshund and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  breeds) from which the epithelial cells were removed were used as scaffolds. The  limbal segments were cultured on these amniotic membranes with 3T3 feeder cells  for 2 weeks. The harvested corneal epithelial cell sheets were stained with H&E  for histologic analysis. The harvested sheets were analyzed immunohistochemically  using a corneal epithelium-specific marker keratin 3(K3) and putative stem cell  markers ABCG2, p63, and vimentin. RESULTS: Cultivated cells from the corneal  limbal tissues reached confluency in 7-8 days. The cultivated cells adhered to  the denuded amniotic membrane and formed a sheet.

The dog had been receiving potassium  citrate capsules to acidify urine for the past 2 years because of an earlier  history of urolithiasis. Results of neurologic examination, spinal cord  radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and spinal cord revealed  no lesions that could have accounted for the neurologic signs. The main  abnormalities on a clinical chemistry profile were marked hyperchloremia (179  mmol/L, reference interval 108-122 mmol/L) and an anion gap of -50.4 mmol/L  (reference interval 16.3-28.6 mmol/L). Because of the severe hyperchloremia,  serum bromide concentration was measured (400 mg/dL; toxic concentration >150  mg/dL; some dogs may tolerate up to 300 mg/dL). Analysis of the potassium citrate  capsules, which had been compounded at a local pharmacy, yielded a mean bromide  concentration of 239 mg/capsule. Administration of the capsules was discontinued  and there was rapid resolution of the dog's neurologic signs. This case of  extreme bromide toxicity, which apparently resulted from inadvertent use of  bromide instead of citrate at the pharmacy, illustrates the importance of knowing  common interferents with analyte methodologies and of pursing logical additional  diagnostic tests based on clinical and laboratory evidence, even when a patient's  history appears to rule out a potential etiology.","2009-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","411-414","","3","38","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19392764","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*pathology; Bromides/blood/*toxicity; Chlorides/*blood; Medication Errors/*veterinary; Potassium Compounds/blood/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Computed tomography (CT) in English Springer Spaniel elbows has allowed  identification of humeral intracondylar fissures (HIF), which can cause lameness  and predispose to condylar fractures. This study aimed to evaluate CT  characteristics of non-lame French Bulldog elbows, to determine the presence of  underlying elbow disease. STUDY DESIGN:  Retrospective evaluation of CT images  from elbows of non-lame French Bulldogs from scans obtained for soft tissue or  neurological evaluation was performed. Images were evaluated for the presence of  HIF and other elbow abnormalities: condylar and supracondylar remodelling,  humeral condylar sclerosis, elbow incongruency, medial coronoid process disease  and elbow osteoarthritis. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS:  Computed tomographic scans from 37 dogs (74 elbows) were reviewed. No HIF were  identified, although 28/74 elbows had an intracondylar sclerotic band. Medial  coronoid process disease was noted in 16/74 elbows, and small osteophytes were  present in 21/74 elbows, suggesting a degree of subclinical elbow disease.  Widening of the caudolateral aspect of the radial incisure was identified (37/74)  as a breed normal. Elbow incongruency was otherwise rare. CONCLUSION:  Non-lame  French Bulldogs showed a low prevalence of occult elbow disease but a proportion  had radial incisure widening. Although humeral intracondylar sclerosis was  present in over a third of dogs, no HIF were identified and therefore no clear  cause for their increased risk of humeral condylar fracture was identified.","2022-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","175-183","","3","35","","Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol","","","","","","","","eng","Thieme.

High species diversity in the Mediterranean is also manifested in  the monophyletic lineage of Alyssum annuals (Brassicaceae), but little is known  about its origin. These species include both diploids and polyploids that grow  mainly in open and disturbed sites across a wide elevational span and show  contrasting distribution patterns, ranging from broadly distributed Eurasian  species to narrow island endemics. Here, we investigated the evolution of  European representatives of this lineage, and aimed to reconstruct their  phylogeny, polyploid and genome size evolution using flow cytometric analyses,  chloroplast and nuclear high- and low-copy DNA markers. The origin and early  diversification of the studied Alyssum lineage could be dated back to the Late  Miocene/Pliocene and were likely promoted by the onset of the Mediterranean  climate, whereas most of the extant species originated during the Pleistocene.  The Aegean region represents a significant diversity center, as it hosts 12 out  of 16 recognized European species and comprises several (sub)endemics placed in  distinct phylogenetic clades. Because several species, including the closest  relatives, occur here sympatrically without apparent niche differences, we can  reject simple allopatric speciation via vicariance as well as ecological  speciation for most cases. Instead, we suggest scenarios of more complex  speciation processes that involved repeated range shifts in response to sea-level  changes and recurrent land connections and disconnections since the Pliocene. In  addition, multiple polyploidization events significantly contributed to species  diversity across the entire distribution range. All seven polyploids,  representing both widespread species and endemics to the western or eastern  Mediterranean, were inferred to be allopolyploids. Finally, the current  distribution patterns have likely been affected also by the human factor (farming  and grazing). This study illustrates the complexity of evolutionary and  speciation processes in the Mediterranean flora.","2021","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","627909","","","12","","Front Plant Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Cetlová, Zozomová-Lihová, Melichárková, Mártonfiová and Španiel.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 33986760  PMCID: PMC8112278","","","","Aegean area; allopolyploidy; Alyssum; annual species; endemics; Mediterranean; phylogeny; sympatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Beagle and beagle/cocker spaniel-hybrid  fetal dogs were obtained by cesarean-section on various days of gestation, timed  from the initial rise of serum progesterone concentration. Morphology of fetal  heads was determined by examining serial coronal sections. RESULTS: On  gestational day 35 (d35), the palatal shelves pointed ventrally alongside the  tongue. On d36, palatal shelves were elongated and elevated to a horizontal  position above the tongue but were not touching. On d37, palatine shelves and  vomer were touching, but the medial epithelial seam (MES) between the apposed  shelves remained. Immunostaining with epithelial protein markers showed that the  MES gradually dissolved and was replaced by mesenchyme during d37-d44, and palate  fusion was complete by d44. Examination of remnant MES suggested that fusion of  palatal shelves began in mid-palate and moved rostrally and caudally. CONCLUSION:  Palate development occurs in dogs in the steps described in humans and mice, but  palate closure occurs at an intermediate time in gestation. These normative data  will form the basis of future studies to determine pathophysiologic mechanisms in  dog models of CP. Added clinical significance is the enhancement of dogs as a  large animal model to test new approaches for palate repair, with the obvious  advantage of achieving full maturity within 2 years rather than 2 decades.","2021-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","230-236","","2","58","","Cleft Palate Craniofac J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32705901","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Disease Models, Animal; Mice; Pregnancy; *Cleft Palate; *Wolves; cleft palate; craniofacial development; Fetus; Palate; periderm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neurological signs were consistent with a lesion involving the pons and rostral  medulla resulting in deficits in the function of the trigeminal, facial, and  vestibular nerves. MRI disclosed a right-sided extraparenchymal mass consistent  with a trigeminal nerve sheath neoplasm that was compressing and invading the  pons and medulla.

Gross and microscopic evaluation of the right  tensor veli palatini muscle (TVPM) was consistent with neurogenic atrophy.  Effusion in the tympanic cavity was likely the result of an inability to open the  auditory tube as a consequence of paralysis of the TVPM. Without the ability to  open the auditory tube, gases present within the auditory tube and tympanic  cavity may be absorbed, creating a negative pressure environment that leads to  fluid transudation and effusion build up.

A  statistically significant higher prevalence of primary intracranial neoplasms was  found in dogs with increasing age and body weights. Dogs ≥15 kg had an increased  risk of meningioma (odds ratio 2.3) when compared to dogs <15 kg. The Boxer,  Boston Terrier, Golden Retriever, French Bulldog, and Rat Terrier had a  significantly increased risk of primary intracranial neoplasms while the Cocker  Spaniel and Doberman Pinscher showed a significantly decreased risk of primary  intracranial neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Intracranial  neoplasia in dogs might be more common than previous estimates. The study  suggests that primary intracranial neoplasia should be a strong differential in  older and larger breed dogs presenting with signs of nontraumatic intracranial  disease. Specific breeds have been identified with an increased risk, and others  with a decreased risk of primary intracranial neoplasms. The results warrant  future investigations into the role of age, size, genetics, and breed on the  development of intracranial neoplasms.","2013-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1143-1152","","5","27","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23865437","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Dog Diseases/*pathology; *Body Weight; Brain Neoplasms/*veterinary; Brain tumor; Glioma; Meningioma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about the prevalence of deafness in dogs  carrying the merle allele. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of deafness in  dogs heterozygous and homozygous for the merle allele of the mouse Silver pigment  locus homolog (SILV) gene. ANIMALS: One hundred and fifty-three privately owned  merle dogs of different breeds and both sexes. METHODS: Hearing was tested by  brainstem auditory-evoked response and classified as bilaterally hearing,  unilaterally deaf, or bilaterally deaf. DNA from buccal cells was genotyped as  either heterozygous or homozygous for the merle allele. Deafness association  tests among merle genotype, eye color, and sex were performed by the chi(2) test.  RESULTS: Deafness prevalence in merles overall was 4.6% unilaterally deaf and  4.6% bilaterally deaf. There was a significant association between hearing status  and heterozygous versus homozygous merle genotype. For single merles (Mm), 2.7%  were unilaterally deaf and 0.9% were bilaterally deaf. For double merles (MM),  10% were unilaterally deaf and 15% were bilaterally deaf. There was no  significant association with eye color or sex. CONCLUSIONS: Deafness prevalence  in merle dogs was greater than that in some dog breeds homozygous for the piebald  gene, such as the English Cocker Spaniel, but comparable to, or lower than, that  in the Dalmatian and white Bull Terrier. Dogs homozygous for the merle allele  were significantly more likely to be deaf than heterozygotes.","2009-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","282-286","","2","23","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19192156","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prevalence; Genotype; Alleles; Dog Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary; Deafness/epidemiology/*genetics/*veterinary; DNA/chemistry/genetics; Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary breed-specific hyperlipidaemia is  reported in Shetland Sheepdogs and Miniature Schnauzers, breeds in which GM are  known to occur more frequently than in other breeds. The objective of this study  was to evaluate the association between GM and hyperlipidaemia in dogs. The study  design was a retrospective case control study. Medical records of dogs diagnosed  with GM at the Veterinary Medical Centre of The University of Tokyo between 1  April 2007 and 31 March 2012, were reviewed. Fifty-eight dogs with GM and a  record of either serum cholesterol, triglyceride, or glucose concentrations were  included in the study. Hypercholesterolaemia (15/37 cases; odds ratio [OR]: 2.92;  95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-8.36) and hypertriglyceridaemia (13/24 cases;  OR: 3.55; 95% CI:1.12-15.91) showed significant association with GM.

Thirty-nine out of 58 cases had at least one concurrent  disease, including pancreatitis (five cases), hyperadrenocorticism (two cases),  and hypothyroidism (two cases). A significant association between GM and  hyperlipidaemia was confirmed, suggesting that hyperlipidaemia may play a role in  the pathogenesis of GM.","2014-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","76-79","","1","199","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These masses are anatomic variants of hepatic masses in  which the center of the mass lies outside the liver contour. Prior to referral,  only one dog had been diagnosed with a hepatic mass, four had been diagnosed with  mid-abdominal masses of unknown origin, and two had been misdiagnosed with  splenic head and pancreatic masses. Using radiographs, the mass locations were  classified as cranioventral (n = 3), mid-abdominal (n = 2), or craniodorsal (n =  2). The gastric axis was deviated in various directions in four cases. Based on  computed tomography (CT) findings, the masses were noted to originate from every  liver lobe (two from the left lateral lobe) and to possess parenchymal (n = 6) or  vascular (n = 1) pedicles. The histopathological results showed that three masses  were benign [hepatic adenoma (n = 1) and nodular hyperplasia (n = 2)] and four  were malignant [hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 3) and cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1)].  For three dogs, triple-phase CT maximum intensity projection images in the  arterial phase clearly showed that the masses were connected to the hepatic  artery. We propose that a pedunculated liver mass should be considered as a  differential diagnosis when a mass is located in the mid-abdomen, even if it is  separated from the liver and with the gastric axis deviated in various  directions. We consider CT imaging to be a useful tool for diagnosis, evaluation,  and surgical planning in dogs with a pedunculated liver mass.","2020","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","581922","","","7","","Front Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Ko, Hwang, Yoon, Eom and Kim.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 33330705  PMCID: PMC7732477","","","","dog; computed tomography; accessory liver; pedicle; pedunculated liver mass; ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CLINICAL FINDINGS: Clinicopathologic findings  included nonanemic hypochromic microcytosis, hypocholesterolemia, persistently  high serum liver enzyme activities, and anicteric hyperbilirubinemia. Histologic  examination of liver biopsy specimens collected when the dog was 6 months and 2  years of age revealed expansion and bridging of portal tracts, occasional  centrilobular parenchymal collapse, scattered lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and  dark red to brown pigment within large aggregates of macrophages, engorged bile  canaliculi, and hepatocytes. The pigment failed to stain for the presence of  iron, copper, bile, and glycoprotein and, when examined with polarized  microscopy, emitted a yellow to green birefringence with occasional Maltese cross  configurations. Further analyses confirmed marked porphyrin accumulation in  blood, urine, feces, and liver tissue; protoporphyrin accumulation in RBCs and  liver tissue; and a signature porphyrin profile and fluorescence peak consistent  with erythropoietic protoporphyria. Advanced protoporphyric hepatopathy was  diagnosed. The chronic dermatopathy was presumed to reflect protoporphyric  photosensitivity. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Management was focused on avoiding  conditions known to induce heme synthesis and catabolism, administrating  ursodeoxycholic acid and antioxidants S-adenosylmethionine and vitamin E, and  avoiding sunlight exposure. At follow-up at 4 years of age, the dog was stable  without evidence of jaundice but with probable persistent erythropoietic  protoporphyria-related solar dermatopathy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical and  histologic features of congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria and resultant  protoporphyric hepatopathy, the diagnosis, and the successful management of a dog  with these conditions over 4 years were described.

Regular physical activity can improve health, and owners are advised to exercise their  dogs on a regular basis. However, limited information exists about associations  between overweight status of dogs and walking activity. An online survey was  conducted between June and August in 2014, coinciding with the broadcast of a  national UK television programme, exploring dog behaviour. Information gathered  included signalment, overweight status, and owner-reported information on  duration and frequency of dog walking. The University of Liverpool Ethics  Committee approved the project, and owners consented to data use. Simple and  multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations between  overweight status and dog walking activity. Data were available from 11 154 adult  dogs, and 1801 (16·1 %) of these were reported as overweight by their owners.  Dogs reported to be overweight dogs were more likely to be neutered (P < 0·0001)  and older (P < 0·0001). Various breeds were over-represented including beagle,  Cavalier King Charles spaniel, golden retriever, Labrador retriever and pug  (P < 0·0001 for all). Both frequency and duration of walking were negatively  associated with overweight status (P < 0·0001 for both). On multiple regression  analysis, duration and frequency were independently and negatively associated  with the odds of being overweight, along with a range of other factors including  age, neuter status and breed. This study has identified associations between  overweight status and exercise. In the future, studies should determine the  reason for this association, and whether changes in walking activity can  influence weight status.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e11","","","6","","J Nutr Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28620486  PMCID: PMC5465938","","","","Physical activity; Canine nutrition; Dog walking; Obese dogs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dog had a history since birth of sneezing and oronasal  reflux of food and liquid. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Oral examination under anesthesia  revealed a short, incompletely formed soft palate with bilateral clefts. A  pseudouvula was not a prominent feature of the condition in this dog. TREATMENT  AND OUTCOME: The dog underwent 1-stage reconstruction of the soft palate by means  of a split-thickness soft palate hinged flap and bilateral buccal mucosal  rotation flaps. Long-term follow-up obtained 3 years after surgery revealed the  dog to be in good general health, with resolution of oronasal reflux; however,  occasional episodes of mild sneezing and nasal discharge persisted. Oral  examination under sedation revealed attenuation of the bilateral clefts; however,  a normal soft palate length was not achieved. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Compared with  previously described techniques, this technique offered the possibility of  1-stage reconstruction of the soft palate in dogs, rather than having 2 staged  procedures performed, and a robust tissue combination that was expected to be  less prone to trauma. This technique may be particularly suitable for affected  dogs where a pseudouvula is not a prominent feature and appears to be applicable  to a variety of skull morphologies. Owners should be made aware that the absence  of normal palatine muscle within the reconstructed palate may affect function,  but even where normal function is not regained, a good quality of life with  minimal clinical signs may be achieved.","2016-01-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","91-95","","1","248","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26684096","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Dog Diseases/*pathology/surgery; Surgical Flaps/*veterinary; Palate, Soft/*abnormalities/surgery; Plastic Surgery Procedures/methods/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three board-certified veterinary  radiologists independently reviewed each of the four images for each protocol and  recorded a numerical quality score for each image. The protocol yielding the  lowest total numerical score was defined as the optimal protocol. There was  overall agreement that the optimal protocol was the one with the following  parameters: sequential mode, 300 mAs, 1 mm slice thickness, 1 s tube rotation  time, medium image reconstruction algorithm and applied beam hardening  correction. Sequential imaging provided optimal image resolution. The thin-sliced  images provided a small blur due to partial volume artifacts. A high tube current  resulted in a relatively low noise level. Use of a medium frequency image  reconstruction algorithm provided optimal contrast resolution for brain tissue.  Use of a proprietary beam hardening correction filter (Posterior Fossa  Optimization) markedly reduced beam-hardening artifact.","2014-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","387-392","","4","55","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 American College of Veterinary Radiology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24506077","","","","Animals; Dogs; canine; computed tomography; brain; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Multidetector Computed Tomography/*veterinary; technique; Veterinary Medicine/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study  was conducted to develop and evaluate a more sensitive platform than existing  semi-quantitative approaches for detecting FUS-CHOP transcripts. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: In the present investigation we describe a novel approach using  real-time PCR to identify and differentiate the fusion transcripts formed in the  t(12; 16)(q13; p11) chromosomal translocation. This method is founded on the  basis of transcript individualized primers and probes, which were designed to  detect specifically the different variants in both frozen and FFPE tissues.  RESULTS: Our results show that the method is highly specific, sensitive, and  superior to the widely used nested PCR approach, and is accurately able to  differentiate the most common variants, as well as quantify copy numbers. Primer  amplification and probe detection of FUS-CHOP from genomic DNA of human, mouse,  cocker spaniel and chicken sources all resulted in completely negative results  indicating this technique is specific for human RNA derived transcripts.  CONCLUSION: This new method offers an additional tool in the investigation of  liposarcoma that may impact considerably on missed diagnosis and it's  accompanying clinical ramifications.","2012-06-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","37-45","","1","57","","Adv Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 22543255","","","","Humans; Polymerase Chain Reaction; In Vitro Techniques; Liposarcoma/*genetics; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods; RNA-Binding Protein FUS/*genetics; Transcription Factor CHOP/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lesions were symmetrical with  small diffuse superficial ulcers, haemorrhagic crusts, adherent purulent  exudation in haired skin, and alopecia with hyperpigmentation and scarring.  Histopathologic evaluation showed multiple, non-intact dermoepidermal junction  vesicles and ulceration associated with a dermal lichenoid infiltrate.  Immunohistochemistry showed strong to moderate reactivity in the dermoepidermal  junction for the antibodies directed against canine IgG, human IgG lambda light  chains and C3, respectively. A diagnosis of autoimmune subepidermal blistering  dermatosis was made. Treatment with oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg and mycophenolate  mofetil (MMF) at 20 mg/kg twice daily was initiated and after 4 weeks the ulcers  and erosions were cured. During the rest of treatment, MMF was maintained at 10  mg/kg twice daily and prednisone could be tapered to 0.25 mg/kg once every other  day without recurrences.

Here, we apply target enrichment with  genome skimming (Hyb-Seq) to unravel the evolutionary history of the Alyssum  montanum-A. repens species complex. Reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships  in diploids supported recent and rapid diversification accompanied by  reticulation events. Of the four main clades identified among the diploids, three  clades included species from the Alps, Apennine and Balkan peninsulas, indicating  close biogeographic links between these regions. We further focused on the clade  distributed from the Western Alps to the Iberian Peninsula, which comprises  numerous polyploids as opposed to a few diploids. Using a recently developed  PhyloSD (phylogenomic subgenome detection) pipeline, we successfully tracked the  ancestry of all polyploids. We inferred multiple polyploidization events that  involved two closely related diploid progenitors, resulting into several sibling  polyploids: two autopolyploids and six allopolyploids. The skewed proportions of  major homeolog-types and the occurrence of some minor homeolog-types, both  exhibiting geographic patterns, suggest introgression with the progenitors and  other related diploids. Our study highlights a unique case of parallel polyploid  speciation that was enhanced by ecological and geographic separation and provides  an excellent resource for future studies of polyploid evolution.","2023-02-23","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","qpad035","","","","","Evolution","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2023.

STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Twenty  cadavers of mesocephalic dogs. METHODS: Cosmetic reconstruction was performed  after incisivectomy and nasal planectomy. Preoperative and intraoperative skull  measurements included width of the nasal planum, rostral and caudal maxilla,  labial flap, and maxilla at ostectomy site; the length of the nose, labial flap,  and philtrum incision; lip thickness; and philtrum placement. Ratios of select  width to length measurements were calculated. Correlation was tested between  skull biometrics and tension during reconstruction as well as resulting opening  of the nasal aperture. RESULTS: Breeds included golden retriever, pit bull,  Labrador retriever, beagle, shepherd, basset hound, boxer mix, cocker spaniel,  and Great Dane. No biometric ratios were predictive of procedural success. The  most important objective measurements that were significantly correlated with  inferior outcome included width of the nasal planum (>3 cm), width of the caudal  maxilla (>6.2 cm), lip thickness (>0.5 cm), width of the labial flap (>2.9 cm),  length of the incision created to make the cosmetic ""philtrum"" (longer incisions  >2.8 cm), and philtrum placement (more dorsal placement). CONCLUSION: Tension  during reconstruction and decreased resultant nasal aperture were associated with  wider facial features and thicker lips as well as directly impacted by cosmetic  philtrum design and placement.

ANIMALS: A 12-year-old male  castrated cocker spaniel and three cadaver heads (one large breed  dolichocephalic, one medium-sized breed mesocephalic, and one small breed  brachycephalic). METHODS: Transorbital endoscopy was performed to obtain biopsies  of an orbital apex mass by using a postcaruncular approach. A 2.7-mm 30° rigid  endoscope fitted with a cystoscope working sheath was used with the aid of a  blunt suction-dissector and fluid ingress. This procedure was first performed on  three cadavers to assess feasibility and later performed in a clinical case.  RESULTS: By using a transorbital postcaruncular approach, it was possible to  visualize and obtain biopsies from structures within the orbital apex with  minimal perioperative morbidity. Dissection and expansion of the working space  was facilitated with the aid of fluid ingress; however, judicious use of fluids  is recommended because secondary orbital edema and chemosis can occur.  CONCLUSION: Transorbital endoscopy via a postcaruncular approach is feasible.

However, there are no epidemiological studies with estimates for the  general dog population. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological  characteristics of NOAI in a large population of insured dogs. ANIMALS: Data were  derived from 525,028 client-owned dogs insured by a Swedish insurance company  representing 2,364,652 dog-years at risk (DYAR) during the period between  1995-2006. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Incidence rates, prevalences, and  relative risks for dogs with NOAI (AI with no previous claim for  hypercortisolism), were calculated for the whole dog population, and for  subgroups divided by breed and sex. Mortality rates were calculated and compared  in dogs with NOAI and the remaining dogs overall. RESULTS: In total 534 dogs were  identified with NOAI. The overall incidence was 2.3 cases per 10,000 DYAR. The  relative risk of disease was significantly higher in the Portuguese Water Dog,  Standard Poodle, Bearded Collie, Cairn Terrier, and Cocker Spaniel compared with  other breeds combined. Female dogs overall were at higher risk of developing AI  than male dogs (RR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.55-2.22; P < .001). The relative risk of death  was 1.9 times higher in dogs with NOAI than in dogs overall.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aims were: to estimate the prevalence  of CM in dogs asymptomatic for CM or syringomyelia, according to 3 currently used  definitions; and, to investigate the effect of brachycephaly and head position  during magnetic resonance (MR) imaging on estimates of the prevalence of CM.  ANIMALS: One ninety-nine client-owned dogs without apparent signs of CM or  syringomyelia. METHODS: Blinded, retrospective analysis. Archived MR images were  analyzed for evidence of cerebellar indentation and impaction into or herniation  through the foramen magnum. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate  the relationship of CM diagnosis with head position and the cranial index (a  measure of brachycephaly). RESULTS: In 185 non-Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  (CKCS) dogs, indentation was identified in 44% (95% CI, 47-51%) and impaction in  22% (95% CI, 16-28%). No asymptomatic, non-CKCS dogs showed herniation.  Regression analysis showed a significant increase in the odds of indentation and  impaction in an extended head position and as the cranial index increased (became  more brachycephalic). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The high prevalence of  cerebellar indentation and impaction suggests that they may be normal anatomical  variations and therefore unsuitable as definitions of CM. We suggest that future  research into CM in dogs should define cases and controls more strictly so that  overlap between normal and abnormal animals is minimized.","2015-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","231-237","","1","29","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25319206  PMCID: PMC4858087","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Canine; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Radiography; Arnold-Chiari Malformation/pathology/veterinary; Cerebellum/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Chiari-like malformation prevalence; Definition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approximately  10 weeks previously the owner reported removing a large number of barley grass  seeds from the dog's coat and ears. Eight weeks later the dog was treated for  pneumonia, based on clinical findings and thoracic radiographs. In the 4 days  prior to referral the dog had a decreased appetite, was lethargic and appeared  unable to urinate voluntarily. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog was bright and alert  but unable to walk. Upper motor neuron signs were indicative of T3-L3 spinal  lesion. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an abnormal low signal linear  structure within the left T12-T13 neural foramen extending to the left lateral  aspects of the thoracic spinal cord was detected, consistent with a foreign body.  A left T12-T13 lateral hemilaminectomy was performed and a grass seed removed  from a tract extending caudally from the T12-13 space, dorsal to the lumbar  transverse processes and the rib head. The dog made a rapid recovery after  surgery with full resolution of clinical signs. DIAGNOSIS: Spinal empyema caused  by a migrating barley grass awn (Hordeum spp.).

METHODS: The medical  records of 13 dogs diagnosed with aortic thromboembolism as the cause of the  clinical signs, and where a complete neurological examination was performed, were  reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The onset was acute in only four dogs, chronic  in five dogs (with all of these presenting as exercise intolerance) or chronic  with acute deterioration in four dogs. Dogs with an acute onset of clinical signs  were more severely affected exhibiting neurological deficits, while dogs with a  chronic onset of disease predominantly presented with the exercise intolerance  and minimal deficits. The locomotor deficits included exercise intolerance with  pelvic limb weakness (five of 13), pelvic limb ataxia (one of 13), monoparesis  (two of 13), paraparesis (two of 13), non-ambulatory paraparesis (two of 13) and  paraplegia (one of 13). There was an apparent male predisposition and the  cavalier King charles spaniel was overrepresented. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The  rate of onset of clinical signs appears to segregate dogs affected by aortic  thromboembolism into two groups, with different clinical characteristics and  outcomes. Dogs with an acute onset of the clinical signs tend to be more severely  affected, while dogs with a chronic onset predominantly present with exercise  intolerance. It is therefore important to consider aortic thromboembolism as a  differential diagnosis in dogs with an acute onset of pelvic limb neurological  deficits and in dogs with longer standing exercise intolerance.","2008-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","178-184","","4","49","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18339088","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Male; Risk Factors; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Sex Factors; Chronic Disease; Prognosis; Acute Disease; Aortic Diseases/mortality/pathology/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/mortality/*pathology; Thromboembolism/mortality/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disease onset, its clinical  course, and survival period of the affected dogs were similar in both models.  Skeletal dysplasia was noted radiographically at 2 months of age, whereas at 4  1/2 months of age there was progressive neurologic impairment. However, dwarfism  and coarse facial features were seen only in ESS. Both models had similar  deficiency in activity of lysosomal beta-galactosidase, but possessed a normal  protein activator for GM1-beta-galactosidase. Both models stored GM1-ganglioside,  asialo-GM1, and oligosaccharides in brain. Furthermore, only the PWD stored  glycoproteins containing polylactosaminoglycans in visceral organs, and neither  model stored them in the brain. Morphologically, both models demonstrated similar  storage material in multiple tissues and cell types. The ultrastructure of the  storage material was cell-type specific and identical in both models. However,  some differences in the lectin staining pattern were noted. Our clinical,  biochemical, and histochemical findings indicate that PWD and ESS may represent  two different mutations of the beta-galactosidase gene. Moreover, the authors  conclude that it is difficult, and inappropriate, to apply the human  classification of GM1-gangliosidosis (i.e. infantile, juvenile, and adult forms)  to these canine models.","1992-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","675-689","","3","140","","Am J Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1546746  PMCID: PMC1886155","","","","Animals; Dogs; Microscopy, Electron; *Disease Models, Animal; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Lipid Metabolism; *G(M1) Ganglioside; Amniotic Fluid/cytology/metabolism; Gangliosidoses/metabolism/*pathology; Placenta/metabolism/pathology; Umbilical Cord/metabolism/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Light microscopy revealed no difference in endplate size or  nerve terminal morphology in age-matched CMG dogs and unaffected littermates. At  all ages there was in individual muscle fibers of CMG dogs an approximately 75%  lower postsynaptic membrane density of acetylcholine receptors (AChR). There was  no evidence that this abnormality had an autoimmune basis. Measurements of  miniature endplate potential amplitude in relation to fiber diameter revealed  that the low density of AChR in the postsynaptic membrane of CMG dogs remained  constant and did not change with the marked progression of muscle weakness during  growth. Antigenic determinants of AChR were deficient in CMG muscle to the same  extent as alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha BT) binding sites. Thus, a low density of  AChR in the muscle's postsynaptic membrane appears to be the principal  abnormality of CMG. The data suggest that the normal increase in number of  acetylcholine (ACh) quanta released by nerve impulse may not fully compensate for  the reduction in depolarization produced by a single quantum as the muscle fiber  diameter increases. This could cause progression of weakness during growth. In  addition to being a useful animal model of a rare form of CMG that resembles one  form of human CMG, canine CMG offers a unique model for investigating events of  synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction.","1984-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","705-716","","9","7","","Muscle Nerve","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6543919","","","","Animals; Dogs; Autoradiography; Bungarotoxins/metabolism; Membrane Potentials; Motor Endplate/physiology; Myasthenia Gravis/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology; Neuromuscular Junction/pathology/*physiology; Receptors, Cholinergic/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All were the offspring of  obligate carriers, resulting from the mating of a hemophilic purebred miniature  Schnauzer male to a normal female Brittany spaniel. The mean age at first  treatment and factor VIII exposure at the time of inhibitor development was 10.3  wk and 286.3 U, respectively.

This  group includes animals derived from a mating between the same purebred miniature  Schnauzer hemophilic male and a purebred miniature Schnauzer carrier female. In  each case, the antibodies recognize both canine and human but not porcine VIII:C.  They are non-precipitating IgG immunoglobulins. Following inhibitor development,  infusion of canine cryoprecipitate was hemostatically ineffective and factor  VIII:C recovery at 30 min was negligible. Infusion of a concentrate of porcine  factor VIII resulted in a correction of the hemostatic defect and optimal factor  VIII:C recovery.

Ausgabe K, Kleintiere/Heimtiere","","2567-5842 1434-1239","10.1055/a-1913-7216","","OBJECTIVE:  Multiple, breeding-related malformations of the skull of brachycephalic dogs are well-known. Whereas the eye-catching deformities of the  nose that lead to dramatic respiratory problems are obvious, changes of the  middle ear are often an incidental finding on CT examinations and usually  clinically inapparent. The objectives of this work were to investigate the  prevalence and characteristics of middle ear effusion in brachycephalic dog  breeds presented for multilevel surgery of upper airway obstructions. MATERIAL  AND METHODS:  Brachycephalic dogs with incidental middle ear effusion detected on  CT scans obtained prior to surgical treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome  were prospectively enrolled. A perendoscopic tympanocentesis followed by  macroscopic description, microscopic cytology and bacteriological analysis of the  fluid was performed. RESULTS:  Prevalence of middle ear effusion in all dogs  presented to the department during the study period was 55/170 (32 %) in 86  middle ears. The only breeds suffering from MEE were French Bulldogs (FB) with a  prevalence of 35/66 (53 %) and Pugs with a prevalence of 20/79 (25 %).  Tympanocentesis was performed in 80 ears. In the majority of cases the effusion  was either mucoid or serous, with a honey-like or ochre colour.Bacteriology was  available for 76 ears and tested positive in 34 (45 %) cases. Cytology was  performed in 73 ears and revealed all effusions to contain inflammatory cells  with a high concentration in 23 (31.5 %) cases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL  RELEVANCE:  Brachycephalic dogs presented for surgical treatment of  brachycephalic airway syndrome have a high prevalence of incidental middle ear  effusions. Cytological findings differ from previously reported analyses of  effusions in Cavalier King Charles spaniels with clinical symptoms of primary  secretory otitis media, where usually cell-free effusions are found. A study  comparing effusions of brachycephalic dogs with vestibular disease to those found  as an incidental condition is warranted.","2022-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","329-336","","5","50","","Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere","","","","","","","","eng","Thieme.

Breed selection was based on a survey  comprising records for nearly 1.9 million purebred dogs belonging to more than  500 different breeds. To derive breed membership from STR genotypes, a range of  algorithms were used. These methods included discriminant analysis of principal  components (DAPC), STRUCTURE, GeneClass2, and the adegenet package for R.  STRUCTURE analyses suggested 21 distinct genetic clusters. Differentiation  between most breeds was clearly discernable. Fourteen of 23 breeds (61%)  exhibited maximum mean cluster membership proportions of more than 0.70 with a  highest value of 0.90 found for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Dogs of only 6  breeds (26%) failed to consistently show only one major cluster. The DAPC method  yielded the best assignment results in all 23 declared breeds with 97.5%  assignment success.

ANIMALS:  Ninety-three client-owned dogs at a referral institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Medical records were reviewed for clinical history, diagnostic testing, and  medical or permanent artificial pacemaker (PAP) treatment. Owners or  veterinarians were contacted for long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty-one dogs  were symptomatic for their bradyarrhythmia and were diagnosed with sick sinus  syndrome (SSS). Thirty-two dogs were asymptomatic for their bradyarrhythmia and  were diagnosed with sinus node dysfunction (SND). Miniature Schnauzers, West  Highland White terriers, Cocker spaniels, and female dogs were overrepresented.  Medical management with positive chronotropic drugs successfully controlled  syncope long-term in 54% of SSS dogs, and acted as a bridge to PAP in 20%.  Positive atropine response predicted medical treatment success. Forty-six percent  of SSS dogs eventually underwent PAP implantation. Median survival time was  approximately 18 months in SND and SSS dogs regardless of treatment strategy.  Congestive heart failure (CHF) associated with progressive valvular heart disease  occurred commonly in all groups, particularly in dogs with  bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus node dysfunction and SSS  represent a spectrum of sinoatrial node disease, which for some dogs may also  involve a component of autonomic dysfunction. Dogs with SND do not require  treatment. Dogs with SSS often require treatment to reduce the frequency of  syncope; medical management is often useful, particularly in atropine responsive  dogs. Prognosis of SSS with treatment is good, though development of CHF does not  appear to be mitigated by treatment.","2016-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","199-212","","3","18","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Reports in other  species than the dog indicate that plasma cortisol concentration after ACTH  administration is affected by gender. We investigated the effect of gender on the  cortisol response to ACTH and Dexamethasone tests in dogs. METHODS: Seven healthy  adult Cocker Spaniels (4 females and 3 males) were assigned to a two by two  factorial design: 4 dogs (2 females and 2 males) received IV Dexamethasone 0.01  mg/kg, while the other 3 dogs received an IV saline solution (control group). Two  weeks later the treatments were reversed. After one month, ACTH was given IV (250  microg/animal) to 4 dogs (2 female and 2 males) while the rest was treated with  saline solution (control group). Cortisol concentrations were determined by a  direct solid-phase radioimmunoassay and cholesterol and triglycerides by  commercial kits. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No effect of treatment was observed in  metabolite concentrations, but females presented higher cholesterol  concentrations. ACTH-treated dogs showed an increase in cortisol levels in the  first hour after sampling until 3 hours post injection. Cortisol concentrations  in Dexamethasone-treated dogs decreased one hour post injection and remained low  for 3 hours, thereafter cortisol concentrations increased. The increase in  cortisol levels from one to two hours post ACTH injection was significantly  higher in females than males. In Dexamethasone-treated males cortisol levels  decreased one hour post injection up to 3 hours; in females the decrease was more  pronounced and prolonged, up to 5 hours post injection.

A potential source of variation among observers is differences in the selection  of measurement points. The objective was to test variability between observers  with different levels of training in thoracic radiology and small animal clinical  practice. Fifty sets of thoracic radiographs of cavalier King Charles spaniels,  were divided into five groups; (Normal) normal cardiopulmonary structures, (I)  slight cardiomegaly, (II) moderate cardiomegaly, (II +) moderate cardiomegaly  with congestive heart failure, and (III +) severe cardiomegaly with congestive  heart failure. Cardiomegaly was confirmed by echocardiography to be caused by  mitral regurgitation because of myxomatous mitral valve disease. Sixteen  observers representing four levels of experience (four observers/level) evaluated  the radiographs; (1) European Diplomates in Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging, (2)  Experienced small animal clinicians, (3) Trainees in small animal clinical  practice (4) Veterinary students. Almost identical mean VHS values were found  among the four experience levels for each of the five groups of radiographs with  a low coefficient of variation, range 1.5-3.2%. Mean difference among the 16  observers was 1.05 +/- 0.32 vertebrae (v). Mean difference among individuals in  each observer group was approximately 0.5 v for all but the groups of trainees  were the difference was 0.6-0.9 v.

It is  composed of multiple forms of a common active subunit of 45-50 kDa, which can  aggregate in different combinations to form polymers, predominantly dimers.  Antiserum was raised against the purified enzyme. There is negligible residual  alpha-L-fucosidase in the tissues of English springer spaniels with the lysosomal  storage disease fucosidosis. Although no alpha-L-fucosidase protein was detected  by Western blotting or by the purification procedure in the affected tissues,  some enzymically inactive cross-reacting material was detected in both normal and  affected tissues. This suggests that another protein without alpha-L-fucosidase  activity was co-purified with the enzyme. Dog liver alpha-L-fucosidase was  precipitated by goat anti-(human liver alpha-L-fucosidase) IgG, indicating  homology between the enzymes in the two species. Two purified storage products  isolated from the brain of a dog with fucosidosis were used as natural substrates  for various preparations of canine liver alpha-L-fucosidase. Analysis of the  digestion mixtures by t.l.c. and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry suggests  that canine alpha-L-fucosidase acts preferentially on the alpha-(1-3)-linked  fucose at the non-reducing end and that removal of alpha-(1-6)-linked  asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine is rate-limiting in the lysosomal  catabolism of fucosylated N-linked glycans.","1988-09-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","861-868","","3","254","","Biochem J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3196299  PMCID: PMC1135162","","","","Animals; Dogs; Isoenzymes/metabolism; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, Thin Layer; alpha-L-Fucosidase/immunology/*metabolism; Blotting, Western; Chemical Precipitation; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Fucosidosis/*metabolism; Liver/enzymology; Tissue Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This study evaluated seven cases from different ophthalmology referrals  submitted for histopathological analysis between 2013 and 2022. RESULTS: EMPs  were diagnosed in a 9-year-old domestic short-haired cat and in six dogs (median  age, 10 years): three English Cocker Spaniels, a Golden Retriever, a Maltese, and  a Pinscher. EMPs affected the third eyelid conjunctiva in five cases (5/7),  followed by the superior bulbar (1/7) and palpebral conjunctivae (1/7),  respectively, and were presented mostly as well-defined, salmon-colored nodules.  Histopathologically, the masses were composed of sheets and packets of round  cells morphologically consistent with mature plasma cells with mild anisocytosis  and anisokaryosis; mitosis and binucleated giant cells were rarely observed.  Follow up for 6/7 cases ranged from 6 months to 2 years. No signs of recurrence  or systemic involvement (multiple myeloma) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: EMP should  be included in the differential diagnoses of canine and feline conjunctival  masses. Staging recommendations should include multiple myeloma diagnostic  evaluation. Our results suggest that primary conjunctival EMP does not appear to  be locally aggressive and has low systemic involvement behavior. The local  surgical excision alone or combined with cryotherapy should be curative.","2022-11-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","21","12","","Animals (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36359139  PMCID: PMC9653729","","","","dog; cat; conjunctiva; extramedullary plasmacytoma; eye","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe the clinical signs, imaging and histopathological  findings, management and outcome of four dogs diagnosed with IOI. METHODS:  Multicentric retrospective study. RESULTS: A total of four dogs (five orbits) of  three different breeds (three cases were English Springer Spaniels [ESS] or  ESS-cross) and ages ranging from 3 to 12 years were included. Initial presenting  signs were unilateral and included exophthalmos, enophthalmos, globe deviation,  thickening and protrusion of the third eyelid and conjunctival hyperemia.  Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identified heterogeneous  space-occupying, contrast-enhancing orbital lesions in all cases. Sparing of the  retrobulbar space was detected in four of five orbits. Histopathology revealed  mixed inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.  Immunohistochemistry was performed in two cases highlighting the presence of  histiocytes and lymphocytes, predominantly T cells. Resolution of clinical signs  was achieved in two cases managed with oral immunosuppressant medication  (corticosteroids alone or combined with cyclosporine or azathioprine), one went  into spontaneous remission, one resolved with topical corticosteroids, and one  underwent exenteration. Recurrence occurred in two cases within 15 months of  initial diagnosis and required further immunosuppressant medication. One case  developed signs in the contralateral orbit within 8 months of presentation.  CONCLUSIONS: IOI is an uncommon condition in dogs. Its diagnosis relies on the  combination of advanced imaging and histology.

Despite its clinical importance, there is limited  epidemiological information available, particularly in South America. AIM: The  main objective of this study was to perform a retrospective, and prospective  analysis of PRA in dogs admitted at the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal  University of Paraná, Brazil. METHODS: Medical records of dogs admitted between  2014 and 2018 were selected through the archives of the Comparative Ophthalmology  Laboratory. A total of 130 dogs with medical records indicating clinical signs  suggestive of PRA, independent of the electroretinography confirmation, were  selected. In order to investigate common characteristics, each patient's clinical  history, ophthalmic examination, and visual status were reviewed (obstacle  course, pupillary light reflex, dazzle reflex, visual tracking to a cotton ball,  and menace responses). Additionally, a prospective study was performed, where  flash electroretinography was performed on 30 animals with clinical signs  suggestive of PRA, and 14 animals were selected for fundus photography. Data were  assessed through descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: A total of  2,055 dogs were evaluated between January 2014 and December 2018. Of those, 130  animals were presumptively diagnosed with PRA (6.33%), consisting of 18 different  breeds and 27 dogs with a mixed pedigree. Poodles were the most prevalent breed  (n = 26; 20.00%), followed by Cocker Spaniels (n = 19; 14.62%). In the reported  caseload, Pomeranians showed a considerably higher odds ratio for PRA development  (15.36%). CONCLUSION: Pomeranians presented a high odds ratio, suggesting that  further studies may be performed with breeds with a high potential for developing  this disease.","2021-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","370-378","","3","11","","Open Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Libya PMID: 34722198  PMCID: PMC8541721","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Prospective Studies; *Dog Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology; Atrophy/veterinary; *Hospitals, Animal; Brazil/epidemiology; ERG; PRA; Retinal dystrophy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Idiopathic canine chronic hepatitis has recognised breed-related  differences in predisposition and prognosis, but reasons behind this are poorly  understood. This retrospective study using archived post mortem tissue aimed to  provide insight into liver ageing in 51 microscopically normal canine livers  across seven breed categories, including those with and without increased risk of  chronic hepatitis. Immunohistochemistry was conducted for γH2AX, p21, and cell  proliferation marker Ki67, and the mean number of positive hepatocytes per high  power field was determined. All three markers were strongly correlated to each  other, but no age-dependent expression was seen in the combined study population.  Overall expression levels were low in most dogs, with median values representing  less than 1.5% of hepatocytes, but this increased to 20-30% in individual dogs at  the upper end of the range. Individual breed differences were noted in two breeds  that have increased risk of chronic hepatitis, with English Springer Spaniels  having lower expression of Ki67 than other dogs, and Labradors having higher  expression of Ki67 and γH2AX than other dogs. These results warrant further  investigation in these breeds and highlight a need to validate reliable markers  of cellular senescence in dogs.","2021-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","21-30","","1","45","","Vet Res Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 33301127  PMCID: PMC7819948","","","","Animals; Retrospective Studies; Canine; Liver; Ageing; Aging/genetics/*physiology; Cellular Senescence; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism; Dogs/classification/genetics/*metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/physiology; Histones/genetics/*metabolism; Ki-67 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism; Ki67; Liver/*metabolism; Senescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN:  Medical records (2008-2019) of dogs with  isolated articular talar fractures were reviewed. RESULTS:  Fourteen dogs met the  inclusion criteria; affected breeds were four German Pointer (three shorthair and  one wirehaired), three Labrador Retrievers, two Rottweilers, two Springer  Spaniels, one cross breed, one Greyhound and one Great Münsterländer. The age  range was 1 to 8 years with a median of 4.7 years. Lameness was usually acute in  onset and had been present for a range of 4 to 540 days prior to referral.The  most common fracture configuration involved the lateral trochlear ridge only  (n = 9). Two of the fourteen fractures affected both trochlear ridges. Thirteen  dogs were initially assessed radiographically with classic orthogonal views, but  a fracture was only visible in five cases. The remainder were confirmed with  further radiographic projections (n = 4) or computed tomography (n = 5). In one  case, the lameness was located to the tarsus by scintigraphy. CONCLUSION:  Isolated articular fracture of the talus is rare and may prove a diagnostic  challenge due to the varied presentations and complex anatomy of the bone.  Pathology of the talus may be suspected in any case of lameness localized to the  tarsus and oblique/skyline radiographic views or advanced imaging should be  performed if standard radiographic views are unremarkable.","2021-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","68-73","","1","34","","Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol","","","","","","","","eng","Thieme.

Its outcome and possible risk  factors are investigated to prognosticate and aid design of diagnostic and  treatment plans. DESIGN: Retrospective case study. METHODS: Client-owned dogs  presented to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Sydney (UVTHS), between  2001 and 2016 with FNP were included (n = 122). The incidence of each cause of  FNP was investigated. A reference population of noncases seen at the UVTHS during  the same time period was used to study the association between idiopathic facial  nerve paralysis (IFNP) and gender, age and breed. RESULTS: IFNP (29.5%) was the  most common diagnosis. Male dogs (odds ratio [OR], 2.3) had increased odds of  IFNP compared with female dogs. Age was a significant risk factor for both the  occurrence of FNP and IFNP. There was higher occurrence of IFNP among middle-aged  dogs (5-13 years) and reduced risk in juvenile dogs (less than 2 years). Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels were over-represented for FNP (OR, 6.9) and IFNP (OR,  17.5). For IFNP, 6 of 16 dogs with known follow-up showed definitive resolution  within 3 years of diagnosis. Concurrent vestibular signs were common in dogs with  middle/inner ear abnormality and intracranial disease; and were also seen in 50%  of dogs with IFNP. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate statistical  predilections in age, gender and breed for IFNP.

Method: This case series included six  consecutive client-owned dogs with mitral regurgitation. All dogs underwent a  combined protocol, including the modified loop technique and De Vega annuloplasty  (MODEL surgery), in 2021. Artificial loops covering 80% of the length of the  strut chordae tendineae were used for chordal replacement. Mitral annuloplasty  was subjectively performed, targeting the circumference of the septal leaflet.  Results: The breeds were Chihuahua-mixed breed, Spitz, Pomeranian, Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel, and Chihuahua, with average ages and weights of 11.4 ± 2.3 years  and 5.49 ± 2.98 kg, respectively. The aortic cross-clamp, pumping, and surgery  times were 64.0 ± 7.5 min, 168.5 ± 39.1 min, and 321.0 ± 53.1 min, respectively.

In this  report, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections associated  with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) is reported. However, there have  been no reports on the treatment of MRSA infection following TPLO in dogs. This  case report describes the use of a combination of vancomycin and rifampicin to  treat MRSA infection following TPLO in a dog. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old  spayed female American cocker spaniel was referred for right hind limb lameness  that did not improve with conservative treatment. The dog was diagnosed with  cranial cruciate ligament rupture, for which TPLO was performed. Once the  surgical wound was closed, the dog licked the skin on the surgical site, causing  the injury to dehisce. MRSA was detected from the purulent discharge, and  chloramphenicol was then administered based on the drug sensitivity test results.  Because of the continued drainage, the implants were removed after the bone union  of the osteotomy site was observed. Since this did not provide any relief to the  existing condition, the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin at 132 days after  TPLO surgery, and the infected location was cleaned many times through a drain  tube placed into the tibia. However, the infection could not be controlled. Thus,  a rifampicin and vancomycin combination was started. As a result, the purulent  discharge disappeared and the fistula entirely closed on the 154th day after TPLO  surgery. CONCLUSION: A combination of rifampicin and vancomycin may be effective  for treating MRSA infection at the surgical site following TPLO surgery that does  not heal despite implant removal and administration of vancomycin.","2021-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","728-733","","4","11","","Open Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Libya PMID: 35070870  PMCID: PMC8770174","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; *Dog Diseases/surgery; *Dog; *Infection; *Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; *MRSA; *Rifampicin; *TPLO; Anterior Cruciate Ligament/surgery; Osteotomy/adverse effects/veterinary; Rifampin/therapeutic use; Stifle/surgery; Vancomycin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cases of afibrinogenemia have been reported in Bernese Mountain, Bichon Frise, Cocker Spaniel, Collie,  Lhasa Apso, Viszla, and St. Bernard dogs. In the present study, we examined four  miniature wire-haired Dachshunds with afibrinogenemia and ascertained their  pedigree. Homozygosity mapping and a genome-wide association study identified a  candidate genomic region at 50,188,932-64,187,680 bp on CFA15 harboring FGB  (fibrinogen beta chain), FGA (fibrinogen alpha chain), and FGG (fibrinogen  gamma-B chain). Sanger sequencing of all three fibrinogen genes in two cases and  validation of the FGA-associated mutation (FGA:g.6296delT,  NC_006597.3:g.52240694delA, rs1152388481) in pedigree members showed a perfect  co-segregation with afibrinogenemia-affected phenotypes, obligate carriers, and  healthy animals. In addition, the rs1152388481 variant was validated in 393  Dachshunds and samples from 33 other dog breeds. The rs1152388481 variant is  predicted to modify the protein sequence of both FGA transcripts  (FGA201:p.Ile486Met and FGA-202:p.Ile555Met) leading to proteins truncated by 306  amino acids. The present data provide evidence for a novel FGA truncating  frameshift mutation that is very likely to explain the cases of severe bleeding  due to afibrinogenemia in a Dachshund family. This mutation has already been  spread in Dachshunds through carriers before cases were ascertained. Genetic  testing allows selective breeding to prevent afibrinogenemia-affected puppies in  the future.","2021-07-13","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","7","12","","Genes (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 34356081  PMCID: PMC8304930","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; dog; Pedigree; Dog Diseases/genetics/*pathology; Genome-Wide Association Study; Dachshund; *Frameshift Mutation; afibrinogenemia; Afibrinogenemia/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; association; fibrinogen alpha chain gene; Fibrinogen/*genetics; mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessed parameters  included clinical signs, laboratory findings, results of thoracic radiography,  autopsy, histopathology, methods for the detection of Pneumocystis, as well as  medical therapy. Pneumocystosis was diagnosed most often in certain breeds  (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Miniature Dachshund) with a predisposition for  impaired immunity. The median age of the dogs was 1 y. Chronic therapy-resistant  respiratory signs, such as tachypnea, dyspnea, and cough, along with  leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and hypogammaglobulinemia, were the most frequently  described clinical and clinicopathologic abnormalities. Pneumocystosis can be  masked by coinfections with other respiratory pathogens, and the successful  detection of Pneumocystis organisms is of major relevance. Several detection  methods have been used in the past, but only a few provide reliable results. In  2017, the cytologic evaluation of Giemsa-stained bronchoalveolar lavage samples  is generally used, even if sensitivity is only moderate.

CLINICAL FINDINGS The dog had no  history of previous illness, and findings of physical examination and laboratory  tests were unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed that the dog was  ambulatory with severe ataxia of the hind limbs. Proprioception was decreased in  the right and left hind limbs (right affected more than left), and spinal  reflexes were bilaterally unremarkable. Moderate signs of pain were detected  during palpation of the lumbar portion of the vertebral column. Findings  suggested a lesion within the thoracolumbar or lumbar segments of the spinal  cord. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extradural spinal cord compression  attributable to an extradural space-occupying lesion originating from or  infiltrating the L4 lamina on the right side. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME  Hemilaminectomy was performed to remove the extradural lesion. Histologic  findings for tissue samples collected during the procedure were consistent with a  neurenteric cyst. The late onset and progression of clinical signs of this rare  congenital malformation were suspected to have been the result of enlargement of  the neurenteric cyst through continuous production of mucus by goblet cells. The  dog responded favorably to surgical decompression and was clinically normal 1  year after surgery. It was euthanized 2 years after surgery for an unrelated  reason (end-stage heart disease), and no neurologic deficits were evident before  that point.

CLINICAL FINDINGS: A temporary  tracheotomy tube was placed prior to referral. Results of physical examination at  our facility, including thoracic auscultation, were unremarkable. Examination of  the larynx revealed a 2 x 2-cm nodular mass on the lateral aspect of the  epiglottis and left arytenoid cartilage. Cytologic examination of the mass  indicated septic suppurative inflammation and intracellular rod-shaped bacteria.  During the procedures, decreased air movement through the temporary tracheotomy  tube was detected, and the tube was replaced. A thrombus was found on the distal  end of the temporary tracheotomy tube; the thrombus obstructed 90% of the tube  lumen. Approximately 12 hours later, auscultation revealed decreased sounds in  all lung fields. Cervical and thoracic radiography revealed an intraluminal soft  tissue opacity distal to the tracheotomy tube. A thrombus that contained hair and  plant material was removed from the trachea by use of an embolectomy catheter and  videogastroscope. Approximately 30 hours after removal of the initial thrombus,  the dog had an episode of respiratory distress. Cervical radiography revealed  another intraluminal opacity.

Slides were digitally  photographed and positive cells were manually counted. Signalment, duration of  illness, affected eye(s), treatment, and therapeutic outcome were reviewed for  each dog. Dogs were divided into groups based on clinical presentation  (unilateral episcleritis, bilateral episcleritis or nodular granulomatous  episclerokeratitis (NGE). RESULTS: Twenty-four cases were evaluated. There were  19 episcleritis (13 unilateral, six bilateral) and five NGE cases. The mean age  for clinical manifestations of unilateral episcleritis was 6.8 years, bilateral  episcleritis was 8.7 years, and NGE was 3.8 years. The Cocker Spaniel was  over-represented in the episcleritis groups. All NGE cases were Collies.  Approximately 50% of the unilateral episcleritis cases resolved and did not  require long-term therapy. Almost all cases of bilateral episcleritis and NGE  required continuous medical therapy to maintain remission. There was a  significantly higher percentage of B lymphocytes in biopsies from lesions that  required ongoing medical therapy to maintain lesion remission than in the lesions  that resolved, and for which medications were discontinued (P = 0.0471).  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for resolution of NGE and bilateral episcleritis  without long-term medical therapy is poor. There is a significant difference in  the inflammatory cell population in episcleritis that resolved with medical  therapy vs. episcleritis that required ongoing medical therapy.","2007-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","168-172","","3","10","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17445078","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Records/veterinary; Immunohistochemistry/veterinary; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/*pathology; Alberta/epidemiology; B-Lymphocytes/cytology; Scleritis/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary; T-Lymphocytes/cytology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extent, shape, number, and location of mineralization were recorded.  Five of the dogs had additional alternate imaging examinations, including bone  scintigraphy, echocardiography, and thoracic computed tomography. A necropsy was  done on one dog, and the area of mineralization was evaluated using routine  histology. The median age was 10 (mean 9.7; SD +/- 2.7) years. There were five  males, seven neutered males, one female, and seven neutered females. The breeds  were: Irish setter (6); rottweiler (7); chow-chow (1); miniature dachshund (1);  borzoi (1); English setter (1); English springer spaniel (1); great Dane (1); and  greyhound (1). Dogs with both right and left lateral radiographs (n = 17) had  mineralization visible on both views, more conspicuously on the right lateral  radiograph (n = 12). Aortic bulb mineralization was identified on the  ventrodorsal radiograph of only one dog. On lateral radiographs, the aortic bulb  mineralization was localized within the 4th intercostal space and in the  craniodorsal quadrant of the cardiac silhouette. In nine of the dogs, there were  complex or multiple mineralizations and in 11 dogs, there was a single  curvilinear mineral opacity oriented in a caudoventral to craniodorsal direction.  In all radiographs, the mineralization was in the expected position of the aortic  bulb, and echocardiography (n = 4), spiral computed tomography (n = 2), and  necropsy (n = 1) confirmed that the mineralization was within the aortic bulb.  Clinical pathologic data of the dogs suggested no reason for metastatic  mineralization. Exact etiopathogenesis of the lesions were not determined in this  study. Based on the histologic findings in one dog, the mineralization seen in  the aortic root is similar to a form of dystrophic mineralization called  Monckeberg's calcific arteriosclerosis in humans. No clinical signs attributable  to the mineralization were observed.","2003-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","20-27","","1","44","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12620045","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Radiography; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; *Calcification, Physiologic; Aortic Valve/*diagnostic imaging/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The liver and  kidney activities of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase and serine:pyruvate  aminotransferase in two Tibetan Spaniel pups with familial oxalate nephropathy  were markedly reduced when compared with a variety of controls. There were no  obvious deficiencies in a number of other enzymes including D-glycerate  dehydrogenase/glyoxylate reductase which have been shown previously to be  deficient in primary hyperoxaluria type 2. Immunoblotting of liver and kidney  homogenates from oxalotic dogs also demonstrated a severe deficiency of  immunoreactive alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase. The developmental expression  of alanine:glyoxylate/serine:pyruvate aminotransferase was studied in the livers  and kidneys of control dogs. In the liver, enzyme activity and immunoreactive  protein were virtually undetectable at 1 day old, but then increased to reach a  plateau between 4 and 12 weeks. During this period the activity was similar to  that found in normal human liver. The enzyme activities and the levels of  immunoreactive protein in the kidneys were more erratic, but they appeared to  increase up to 8 weeks and then decrease, so that by 36 weeks the levels were  similar to those found at 1 day. The data presented in this paper suggest that  these oxalotic dogs have a genetic condition that is analogous, at least  enzymologically, to the human disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1.","1991-02-22","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","134-138","","2","1096","","Biochim Biophys Acta","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 1672096","","","","Animals; Dogs; Blotting, Western; Liver/enzymology; Alanine Transaminase/deficiency/immunology/metabolism; Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism; D-Amino-Acid Oxidase/metabolism; Dog Diseases/*enzymology; Hyperoxaluria/enzymology/*veterinary; Kidney/enzymology; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism; Transaminases/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amount of  myelin basic protein (MBP) in the brainstem of affected 4-week-old pups was 2.6%  of that in age-matched controls, while the levels of 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide  phosphodiesterase (CNP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) were 10% and 15%  of the control levels, respectively. Similar results were obtained in the spinal  cord and hemispheres, and the amounts of these proteins in the mutant pups did  not change substantially between 4 and 16 weeks of age. The amount of the 21 kDa  MBP compared to the 18 kDa MBP was relatively increased in the shaking pups,  suggesting that the small amount of myelin formed was immature. The yields of  myelin fractions from the mutant pups were very low; e.g., the yield from the  brainstems of 4-week-old mutants was only 2.4% of that from age-matched controls  and the yield did not increase by 16 weeks. The isolated myelin fractions  contained very little MBP (less than 0.5% of total protein) or proteolipid  protein, indicating that they were a very immature form of myelin or consisted  largely of non-myelin contaminants. MAG in the 'myelin fractions' from the mutant  brainstems were 9-15 fold higher and CNP levels were 2-3 fold higher than those  in whole homogenates, suggesting that the isolated fractions were enriched in  oligodendroglia-derived membranes. Overall, the biochemical results are  consistent with a severe hypomyelination of the CNS in which a small amount of  immature myelin is formed.","1986-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","43-50","","1-2","392","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 3708384","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Brain Stem/analysis; Central Nervous System Diseases/*genetics/metabolism; Central Nervous System/*analysis; Myelin Proteins/*isolation & purification; Myelin Sheath/*analysis; Spinal Cord/analysis; Telencephalon/analysis; Tremor/*genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OME has been reported  in a brachycephalic breed (boxer), and the same condition is described as primary  secretory OM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. These dogs can be asymptomatic or  present with pain, facial nerve paralysis and reduced hearing. This report  describes two cases of OME with associated neurologic signs in Boston terriers  with no previous history of OE, normal external ear canals and tympanic  membranes. Neurologic evaluation revealed right head tilt along with vestibular  ataxia and frequent walking tight circles to the right in case 1, and a dull  mentation with a right-sided head tilt and torticollis, vestibular tetra-ataxia,  ambulatory tetraparesis and circling to the right in case 2. MRI imaging of the  brain was performed. Results showed bilateral OM with right-sided otitis interna  and equivocal associated otogenic meningitis in case 1 and right-sided OM in case  2. Myringotomy was performed, and both dogs' ME sampled for cytology that only  revealed inflammatory cells; and bacterial cultures which revealed a light growth  of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in case 1. ME were flushed with sterile saline. Oral  glucocorticoids and antibiotics based on the susceptibility results, and a  compound antibiotic and glucocorticoid ear solution were prescribed to case 1.  Neurologic improvement was observed a few days after the appointment, but a mild  right-sided head tilt remained evident. Owner of case two elected humane  euthanasia due to patient respiratory difficulties upon anaesthetic recovery and  other concurrent healthy concerns. Current findings reinforce that brachycephalic  dogs may be prone to develop OME, and advanced imaging tests are key to the  diagnosis.","2023-02-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","","","","Vet Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

METHODS: Incidence of leptospirosis diagnosis in dogs during 2016 was  estimated from dogs in primary-care practices from the VetCompass Programme  (n = 905,543). A case-control study of laboratory cases (n = 362) versus  VetCompass controls explored factors (age, sex, neutering, breed, Kennel Club  group, urban-rural location, indices of deprivation) associated with  leptospirosis diagnosis through multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS:  Annual incidence risk of leptospirosis in the VetCompass population was 0.8 cases  per 100,000 dogs (0.0008%, 95% CI 9.1 × 10(-8) -5.2 × 10(-5) ). Adult dogs,  especially 1- < 5 years olds (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.54), and dogs  attending urban clinics (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.35) had reduced odds of  leptospirosis versus dogs < 1 year old and rural dogs, respectively. Dogs  attending clinics in less deprived areas had increased odds of diagnosis  (OR = 3.63, 95% CI 2.28-5.78) compared to crossbreds, Cocker Spaniels (OR = 4.25,  95% CI 2.65-6.84), Collies (OR = 3.53, 95% CI 2.22-5.62) and Lurchers (OR = 3.49,  95% CI 1.50-8.11) had increased odds of diagnosis.

This study's objective was to describe the  incidence of, and strategies for the management of post-operative respiratory  complications in brachycephalic dogs undergoing surgical correction of one or  more components of BAS. METHODS: Medical records of 248 brachycephalic dogs  treated surgically for BAS were retrospectively reviewed for demographic  information, procedures performed, post-operative complications and treatment  implemented, hospitalisation time, and necessity for further surgery. RESULTS:  Pugs, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and British Bulldogs were the most commonly  encountered breeds. Dogs which experienced a complication were significantly  older (mean was 5.5 years, compared with 4.1 years [P < 0.01]). Fifty-eight dogs  (23.4%) had complications which included: dyspnoea managed with supplemental  oxygen alone (7.3%, n = 18), dyspnoea requiring anaesthesia and re-intubation  (8.9%, n = 22), dyspnoea necessitating treatment with a temporary tracheostomy  (8.9%, n = 22), aspiration pneumonia (4%, n = 10), and respiratory or cardiac  arrest (2.4%, n = 6). Five of the 22 dogs requiring anaesthesia and re-intubation  deteriorated 12 or more hours after post-surgical anaesthetic recovery. The  overall mortality rate in this study was 2.4% (n = 6). Age, concurrent airway  pathology, and emergency presentation significantly predicted post-operative  complications. CONCLUSION: Our data show the importance of close monitoring for a  minimum of 24 h following surgery by an experienced veterinarian or veterinary  technician. Surgical intervention for BAS symptomatic dogs should be considered  at an earlier age as an elective procedure, to reduce the risk of post-operative  complications.","2020-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","173-180","","5","98","","Aust Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 Australian Veterinary Association.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32037517","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Retrospective Studies; *Dog Diseases; dogs; Postoperative Complications/veterinary; Postoperative Period; airway obstruction; Airway Obstruction/*veterinary; Craniosynostoses/*veterinary; dyspnoea; post-operative complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS STUDIED: 83 dogs (119 eyes) with PRH. PROCEDURES: Medical records  of dogs evaluated by the Cornell University ophthalmology service with a clinical  diagnosis of PRH between 2006 and 2015 were reviewed. For this study, PRH was  defined as retinal hemorrhages ≤ 1 optic disk diameter in size and dogs with  other posterior segment ocular diseases were excluded. Signalment and clinical  features of the dogs were recorded, including concurrent ocular and systemic  diseases. RESULTS: Punctate retinal hemorrhage was identified in 119 eyes of 83  dogs. The mean (±standard deviation) age of dogs was 10.0 (±3.8) years.  Mixed-breed dogs, Golden Retrievers, Jack Russell Terriers, and English Springer  Spaniels were statistically overrepresented relative to the ophthalmology service  canine referral population during the same period. Hemorrhages were found in all  retinal locations and varied in number. Concurrent ocular disease was present in  78 eyes (66%) including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, uveitis, and cataracts. Fifty  dogs (60%) suffered from concurrent systemic disease and diabetes mellitus,  multiple myeloma, and systemic hypertension were statistically overrepresented in  the PRH population. Less frequently, other serious systemic diseases were present  in dogs with PRH including immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, leptospirosis,  metastatic neoplasia, and thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of PRH in  dogs may be increased by certain ocular and systemic diseases. As the presence of  PRH can be associated with underlying systemic disease in dogs, it may prompt  further clinical investigation and diagnostics.","2018-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","233-239","","3","21","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28799185","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*etiology; dog; diabetes mellitus; Neoplasms/complications/veterinary; Diabetes Complications/veterinary; Adrenocortical Hyperfunction/complications/veterinary; Eye Diseases/complications/*veterinary; hemorrhage; hypertension; Hypertension/complications/veterinary; Hyperthyroidism/complications/veterinary; multiple myeloma; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/veterinary; retina; Retinal Hemorrhage/etiology/*veterinary; Thrombocytopenia/complications/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No relevant inter-breed  differences were observed for serum 5-HT concentrations regarding CIPF  predisposition. VEGF values from 89.3% of samples tested were below the kit  detection limit. In conclusion, high CXCL8 blood concentrations and possibly CCL2  concentrations might be related to the breed predisposition of the WHWT for CIPF  and warrants further investigations.","2015-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","57-62","","","101","","Res Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In humans, a defect of the two main cobalamin-dependent  intracellular enzymes (i.e., methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase)  may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and hypermethylmalonic acidemia. The aim of this  retrospective study was to evaluate serum homocysteine (HCY) and methylmalonic  acid (MMA) concentrations in cobalamin-deficient Shar-Peis and dogs of six other  breeds. Serum samples (n=297) from cobalamin-deficient dogs (Shar-Peis, German  Shepherd dogs, Labrador Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, Boxers, Cocker Spaniels,  and Beagles) were analyzed for serum HCY and MMA concentrations. A Fisher's exact  test was used to evaluate if cobalamin deficiency in Shar-Peis is associated with  hyperhomocysteinemia. Serum HCY and MMA concentrations were higher in  cobalamin-deficient Shar-Peis compared to cobalamin-deficient dogs of the six  other breeds (P<0.0001). Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with cobalamin  deficiency in Shar-Peis (P=0.009). In addition, serum HCY and MMA concentrations  did not differ between cobalamin-deficient German Shepherd dogs with and without  exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a potential cause of secondary cobalamin  deficiency. These findings suggest that the function of the two intracellular  cobalamin-dependent enzymes is impaired in Shar-Peis with cobalamin deficiency.","2013-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","420-426","","2","197","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23499543","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Cobalamin; Deficiency; Dog Diseases/*blood/genetics/metabolism; Homocysteine; Homocysteine/*blood/metabolism; Methylmalonic acid; Methylmalonic Acid/*blood/metabolism; Shar-Pei dog; Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/blood/genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their effects on asymptomatic heart  disease remain controversial. HYPOTHESIS: Benazepril (BNZ), an ACEI, could have  beneficial effects at the asymptomatic stage of degenerative mitral valve disease  (MVD). ANIMALS: Dogs with ISACHC class Ia MVD and moderate-to-severe mitral  regurgitation (MR) assessed by the color Doppler mapping technique at entry (Day  0) were retrospectively included. METHODS: Dogs were assigned to the treated  group (BNZ group) if they received BNZ (and no other cardiac medication) from Day  0 or to the untreated group (UT group) if they did not receive any cardioactive  treatment until occurrence of CHF. RESULTS: A total of 141 dogs were included in  the study, 66 in the BNZ group (dosage: 0.30 +/- 0.13 mg/kg) and 75 in the UT  group. In the population (n = 93) including all breeds except Cavalier (CKC) and  King Charles Spaniels (KC), median survival time to all causes of death in the  BNZ group (n = 34, 3.3 years) was significantly longer than in the UT group (n =  59, 1.9 years) as was time to cardiac event (P < .05). Conversely, no effect of  the BNZ treatment was observed in the CKC and KC population. CONCLUSIONS AND  CLINICAL RELEVANCE: BNZ had beneficial effects in asymptomatic dogs other than  CKC and KC affected by MVD with moderate-to-severe MR.

Compared to the general hospital  population Yorkshire terriers, Chinese Shar-Peis and cocker spaniels showed a  strong predilection. No such predilection was found regarding the sex of the  animals. The age of the dogs at the onset of the clinical signs ranged from 2  months to 8 years (median: 2.5 years). Moderate to severe pruritus, noticed in  all the 91 dogs, was either localized (29/91) or generalized (64/91) and  non-seasonal (43/91), seasonal (19/91) or of unknown seasonality (29/91). The  most common cutaneous lesions included erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypotrichosis  and crusts; their body distribution was generalized (64%) or localized (36%) with  the feet as the most common site of involvement. Five dogs that had unlesional  skin were significantly younger and had been pruritic for a shorter period of  time compared to the majority of our study population. Otitis externa (43/91) and  bacterial pyoderma (30/91) were the most common conditions associated with atopic  dermatitis, while the prevalence of Malassezia dermatitis was very low (2/91). Of  the other allergic skin diseases flea allergic dermatitis was the most common  (29/91) followed by food hypersensitivity (2 out of the 15 dogs tested). The  majority of the dogs demonstrated multiple sensitivities to the 50 aeroallergens  tested, while domestic mites (77/91), and particularly Dermatophagoides farinae  (64/91), were the most commonly implicated. The total number of the positive  intradermal test reactions was increasing parallel to the age of the dogs but it  was negatively associated with the presence of skin lesions on the carpal and  tarsal joints.","1999-07-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","61-73","","1","69","","Vet Immunol Immunopathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 10490235","","","","Animals; Dogs; Prevalence; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology; Greece/epidemiology; Skin Tests/veterinary; Dermatitis, Atopic/epidemiology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary genetic  characterisation of Pneumocystis carinii f.sp.'canis' (P. canis) in dogs and  thereby develop a reliable molecular protocol to definitively diagnose canine  PCP. We investigated P. canis in a variety of lung specimens from dogs with  confirmed or strongly suspected PCP (Group 1, n = 16), dogs with non-PCP lower  respiratory tract problems (Group 2, n = 65) and dogs not suspected of having PCP  or other lower respiratory diseases (Group 3, n = 11). Presence of Pneumocystis  DNA was determined by nested PCR of the large and small mitochondrial subunit  rRNA loci and by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay  developed using a new set of primers. Molecular results were correlated with the  presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes detected in cytological/histological  preparations. Pneumocystis DNA was amplified from 13/16 PCP-suspected dogs (Group  1) and from 4/76 dogs of control Groups 2 and 3 (combined). The latter four dogs  were thought to have been colonized by P. canis. Comparison of CT values in  'infected' versus 'colonized' dogs was consistent with this notion, with a  distinct difference in molecular burden between groups (CT ≤ 26 versus CT range  (26 <CT < 35), respectively). Phylogenetic analyses showed that P. canis is  specifically 'canine' associated, being separated from other mammalian  Pneumocystis species, thereby confirming the accuracy of qPCR amplicon for  Pneumocystis in dogs. Using qPCR, Pneumocystis DNA can be detected in specimens  from the respiratory tract and a CT value can be interpreted to distinguish  infection versus colonization.","2017-11-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","828-842","","8","55","","Med Mycol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2017.

METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of CT examinations of tympanic  bullae performed over a six year period. Medical records were reviewed for  signalment, clinical signs and cytological evaluation of the external ear canal.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose  of this work was to evaluate for the presence of a genetic defect in the  β1-tubulin gene in macrothrombocytopenic NT and CT. METHODS: Samples from 20  healthy dogs (13 NT and 7 CT) were collected at different institutions in Italy  (n = 8), United Kingdom (n = 3), and United States (n = 9). Genomic DNA was  harvested from EDTA-anticoagulated blood and all coding areas and exon-intron  splice sites in the gene encoding β1-tubulin were amplified and sequenced.  RESULTS: Twelve dogs (9 NT and 3 CT) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) in exon 1 at nucleotide position 5 (G5A) that would result in the change of  an arginine to a histidine at amino acid position 2 (R2H). Four dogs (3 NT and  one Cairn Terrier) were heterozygous for the SNP, and 4 dogs (one Norfolk Terrier  and 3 CT) matched the normal canine genome. Homozygous dogs for the SNP were  macrothrombocytopenic with platelet counts ranging from 19,000 to 110,000/μL.  Heterozygous and normal dogs had normal platelet counts and morphology. None had  the CKCS point mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The β1-tubulin N-terminal amino acids form  the nucleotide-binding domain and thus this mutation could affect GTP binding  enough to influence platelet formation in homozygous but not in heterozygous  dogs. The presence of macrothrombocytopenia only in homozygous affected dogs  reveals an association between the SNP and the phenotype.","2014-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","317-321","","3","43","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology and European Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25060661","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Pedigree; Phenotype; Dog; Tubulin/*genetics; Dog Diseases/blood/*genetics; Thrombocytopenia/blood/genetics/*veterinary; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; *Point Mutation; Blood Platelets; GTP binding; platelets; Protein Structure, Tertiary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence for a major autosomal recessive locus.","Human genetics","","0340-6717","10.1007/s004390050491","","Although several studies have demonstrated familial aggregation of nonsyndromic cleft palate (CP), the mode of inheritance still remains uncertain. We report the  results of complex segregation analysis performed in families of 357 consecutive  newborns affected with nonsyndromic CP (i.e., CP not a component feature of  malformation syndrome, sequence or association), and registered in the North East  Italy and Emilia Romagna congenital malformation registries in the period  1981-1993. This sample, based on a large number of consecutive births, in a  well-defined geographical area, with quality control to detect associated  anomalies and malformation syndromes, is independent of the number of affected  subjects in the family and of CP severity, fitness, and survival. We have  analyzed, using the mixed model, the whole sample of nonsyndromic CP, including  isolated (i.e., without other anomalies) CP (CPI) and CP associated with at least  one other anomaly (CPA), for which a diagnosis of malformation syndrome was not  possible. When nonsyndromic CP (including CPA) are considered in the analysis,  there is no heterogeneity between CPA and CPI nor between CP including hard  palate (CPH) and CP of the soft palate only (CPS). POINTER and COMDS programs  cannot discriminate between alternative genetic models; only the hypothesis of  non-genetic transmission is rejected. The COMDS analysis two-locus model, which  indicates that a modifier locus (or loci) operates in addition to a single major  locus (SML), does not show evidence of better fit than SML, polygenic, and  multifactorial models. When the severity parameter (defined as CPH and CPS) is  added, CPI and CPA show heterogeneity. Eventually, when the analysis is limited  to CPI and includes information on severity, a recessive SML, with low penetrance  and determining CPH, provides a significant best fit. To have defined a genetic  model for CPI and provided evidence for SML inheritance suggests that genetic  linkage studies could be implemented. This conclusion is in agreement with  previous studies which showed a significant association between alleles of  transforming growth factor alpha and CP only in humans, and that single recessive  genes may play a crucial role during palatogenesis in mice as well as in Brittany  spaniels. Application of the candidate genes to human CPH families could reveal  whether these genes are involved.","1997-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","204-209","","2","100","","Hum Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 9254850","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Prevalence; Pedigree; Genotype; Phenotype; Alleles; *Genes, Recessive; Models, Genetic; Cleft Palate/epidemiology/*genetics; Infant, Newborn; Italy/epidemiology; Meiosis; Software; Statistics as Topic/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the first months of its life, the dog  had exhibited constant serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, productive cough,  sneezing, reverse sneezing, otitis, and recurrent episodes of fever. The  respiratory signs had been treated several times with antibiotics, without ever  achieving a complete resolution. Clinical examination revealed normal rectal  temperature (38.3°C), increased respiratory rate (40breaths/min), a copious  mucous nasal discharge and right deviation of the heart apex beat (ictus cordis).  Increased respiratory sounds with moist rales and crackles were found on chest  auscultation. An increase in serum creatinine, urea and phosphorus,  hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria were found. Lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs  of the thorax and of the abdomen showed the transposition of the heart, with the  cardiac apex pointing toward the right (dextrocardia), bronchointerstitial lung  pattern, areas of consolidation, lesions consistent with bronchiectasis caves and  a mirror-image of abdominal organs, confirming the diagnosis of complete situs  inversus (CSI). Respiratory signs, combined with CSI, suggested the diagnosis of  Kartagener syndrome (KS). Abdominal ultrasound showed an increase in the  echogenicity of the renal parenchyma, a loss of definition of the  corticomedullary line, slight bilateral pyelectasis, and decreased cortical  perfusion. The dog died 2 months later because of a further worsening of the  clinical condition. Necroscopy demonstrated the existence of CSI, rhinosinusitis,  bronchitis, and bronchiectasis, so confirming the diagnosis of KS, and renal  amyloidosis. This is the first case reported in veterinary medicine of the  presence of renal amyloidosis together with KS in a dog.","2017-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","61-65","","2","32","","Top Companion Anim Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Malignant PNSTs (MPNSTs) are uncommon in  domestic animals. This report describes the concomitant occurrence of PNSTs in a  10-year-old female cocker spaniel with a clinical history of respiratory  impairment. Grossly, there was a large infiltrative mass in the caudal lobe of  the right lung; smaller nodules were observed in the other lobes of the right  lung. Furthermore, a small encapsulated cutaneous nodule was observed on the left  hindlimb. Histopathology of the pulmonary tumours revealed the proliferation of  pleomorphic spindle-shaped cells with moderate mitotic index arranged in  interwoven bundles and concentric Antoni A and Antoni B patterns; invasion of the  adjacent pulmonary tissue was observed. The cutaneous nodule consisted of  neoplastic mesenchymal cells in interwoven bundles with concentric whorls, but  without the marked anisokaryosis, binucleation and infiltrative growth seen in  the pulmonary tumour. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both tumours were  immunoreactive for vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100 protein,  but were negative for factor VIII. These findings are indicative of a MPNST in  the lung with a concomitant benign PNST in the limb. This case represents the  first report of a primary MPNST in the lung of a dog. This neoplastic growth  should be included in the differential diagnosis of primary malignant pulmonary  tumours of dogs.","2017-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","46-50","","1","157","","J Comp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Thyroid disease is typically  absent. A monoclonal gammopathy is usually present, as are other comorbidities.  Descriptions of scleromyxoedema in the veterinary literature are limited to a  single feline case. One dog, previously reported as having papular mucinosis,  exhibited features that matched the more current diagnostic criteria of  scleromyxoedema. OBJECTIVES: To describe generalized papular mucinosis in a dog  with systemic illness and to compare the signs with those of human lichen  myxoedematosus conditions, specifically scleromyxoedema. RESULTS: A nine-year-old  female, spayed English springer spaniel dog presented with generalized papules  and nodules (0.5-5 cm) on the body and proximal fore and hind limbs, sparing the  face and distal limbs distal to carpi/tarsi. Larger nodules were erythematous.  Nodules occurred in proximal limb muscles. The dog had concurrent osteoarthritis  of the elbows and coxofemoral joints, developed generalized weakness, declined in  health and was euthanized. Thyroid disease was lacking and a monoclonal  gammopathy was not present. Histopathological evaluation revealed the classic  triad of mucin, fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis with very mild  inflammation, as described for humans. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We  document scleromyxoedema in a dog with significant morbidity and features of the  human disease. Recognizing the typical histopathology is important for  identifying cases and to establish a diagnosis. Systemic evaluation is important  to identify evidence of internal disease and associated comorbidities, which are  common, variable, and impact classification and prognosis in humans.","2017-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","503-e119","","5","28","","Vet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 ESVD and ACVD.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28439995","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology; Skin/pathology; Scleromyxedema/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary; Skin Diseases/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AIM: To investigate the  association between serum 5-HT concentration and MMVD severity in dogs, and to  assess potential associations between serum 5-HT concentrations and dog  characteristics, echocardiographic variables, heart rate, systolic blood  pressure, presence of macrothrombocytosis, and plateletcrit. ANIMALS: A total of  120 client-owned dogs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dogs were prospectively recruited  and were classified by standard echocardiography into healthy (dogs of breeds  predisposed to MMVD, but without echocardiographic evidence of the disease),  mild, moderate, or severe MMVD groups. Serum 5-HT concentrations were analyzed  using an ELISA. RESULTS: Dogs with severe MMVD had lower serum 5-HT  concentrations than healthy dogs (P = .0025) and dogs with mild MMVD (P = .0011).  Unilinear and multiple regression analyses showed that serum 5-HT concentrations  decreased with increasing left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao), were higher  in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs compared to dogs of other breeds,  and were higher in female dogs than in male dogs. The LA/Ao was the variable most  strongly associated with serum 5-HT concentration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL  IMPORTANCE: The finding of higher serum 5-HT concentrations in dogs of breeds  predisposed to the early onset of MMVD (CKCS) and dogs with mild MMVD suggests  that alterations in 5-HT signaling might play a role in progression of early  stages of MMVD.","2013-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1105-1112","","5","27","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23865457","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Cardiology; Dog Diseases/*blood; Predictive Value of Tests; Biomarkers/blood; Serotonin/*blood; Mitral Valve Prolapse/blood/*veterinary; Canine myxomatous disease; Platelet function; Valvular disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The polymorphisms of monoamine  oxidase B gene (MAOB) were detected by PCR-RFLP. Statistics analysis indicated  that genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms were significantly  different among three breeds (P < 0.01). With GLM analysis of SAS software,  association analysis was conducted between MAOB gene polymorphisms and locomotion  and vocalization behavior parameters in the open-field test. The results showed  that MAOB gene polymorphisms had a significant effect on walking time, squares  crossed, lying time, the times of standing up against walls(P < 0.01 or P < 0.05)  and were associated with the times of posture change (P=0.064). Walking time and  squares crossed were higher in TT genotype puppies than those in TC and CC  puppies (P < 0.05) and the times of posture change and standing up against walls  were also higher than those in CC (P < 0.05). In addition, lying time in CC  genotype puppies were higher than that in TT (P < 0.05). MAOB had a positive  effect on walking time, lying time, squares crossed, the times of posture change,  the times of standing up against walls in the three dog breeds that was highly  statistically significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05).

The  clinical signs were consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS): there were no  target or arciform lesions typical of erythema multiforme minor and major; more  than one mucosal surface was affected; epidermal detachment affected less than 10  per cent of the body surface area; and there was a clear history of drug  exposure. Systemic signs included a severe hepatopathy, dyspnoea, pyrexia and  cachexia. Glucocorticoid therapy was associated with secondary infection by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The clinical signs rapidly resolved following a single  intravenous infusion of 0.51 g/kg human immunoglobulin (ivHIG) as a 5 per cent  solution. By blocking FAS/FAS ligand (CD95/CD95L) interactions, ivHIG is thought  to prevent keratinocyte apoptosis. It also binds to immunoglobulin G Fc  receptors, inhibiting cell activation and cytokine synthesis, neutralises  autoantibodies and immune complexes, blocks complement activity, is antimicrobial  and increases colloid osmotic pressure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the  first report of successful treatment of canine SJS using ivHIG, although it has  been used to treat erythema multiforme in a cat and toxic epidermal necrolysis in  a dog.","2004-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","357-361","","7","45","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15266858","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Diagnosis, Differential; Anti-Infective Agents/*adverse effects; Dog Diseases/chemically induced/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*therapeutic use; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary; Surgical Wound Infection/drug therapy/veterinary; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN:  Clinical case report. SAMPLE POPULATION: An 11-month-old female Brittany spaniel.  RESULTS: A PDA was diagnosed in the dog after referral for a grade IV/IV cardiac  murmur. Diagnostic tests performed included a minimum database, thoracic  radiography, and echocardiography. Conventional surgical ligation of the PDA was  performed. The postoperative recovery from anesthesia was uneventful.  Approximately 5 hours after surgery, the dog vocalized once and collapsed. All  resuscitative efforts failed. Necropsy showed a large, spiral rupture of the  cranial and dorsal wall of the aorta that extended from the left subclavian  artery to 2 cm distal to the PDA-aorta junction. No evidence of intramural,  perianeurysmal hemorrhage or inflammation was noted. Histopathologic examination  of the ruptured aneurysm showed that the wall lacked a defined tunica intima and  endothelial cell layer. A distinct separation of the thinned tunica media  parallel to the elastic fibers was noted. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  Dilatation of the aorta near the area of a PDA is one of the recognized  abnormalities associated with the condition. Aneurysmal dilatation results from  and contributes to abnormal blood flow dynamics and increased aortic wall  tension, which promotes expansion. Although an unusual and previously unreported  sequela, rupture of the aneurysm should be considered a possible complication  when ligation of a PDA with a conspicuous aortic aneurysmal dilation is  performed.","2002-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","259-265","","3","31","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2002 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11994854","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Ultrasonography; Radiography; Fatal Outcome; Postoperative Complications/veterinary; Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/surgery/*veterinary; Aortic Rupture/etiology/*veterinary; Dilatation/adverse effects/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PDE6B gene was  isolated from a genomic library. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis  revealed eight intronic variations in different subsets of the 14 dog breeds  investigated. In addition, we identified an 8-bp insertion after codon 816 in  certain Sloughi dogs. Analysis of PRA-affected and obligatory carrier Sloughis  showed that this mutation cosegregates with disease status in a large pedigree.  All other exchanges identified were not located in functionally relevant parts of  the gene (e.g., in the splice signal consensus sites). In most dog breeds  (Labrador retriever, Tibetan mastiff, dachshund, Tibetan terrier, miniature  poodle, Australian cattle dog, cocker spaniel, collie, Saarloos wolfhound,  Chesapeake Bay retriever, and Yorkshire terrier), PDE6B was excluded as a  candidate gene for gPRA because heterozygous allele constellations were detected  in diseased animals. Therefore, the PDE6B sequence variations did not segregate  together with the mutation(s) causing gPRA. Direct and indirect DNA tests  concerning gPRA can be offered now for a variety of different dog breeds.","2000","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","261-267","","3-4","90","","Cytogenet Cell Genet","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2000 S.

OBJECTIVES: Clinically and genetically characterize HSAN  in a family of mixed breed dogs. ANIMALS: Five 7-month-old mixed breed dogs from  2 related litters were presented for evaluation of a 2-month history of acral  mutilation and progressive pelvic limb gait abnormalities. METHODS: Complete  physical, neurological, electrodiagnostic, and histopathological evaluations were  performed. Whole genome sequencing of 2 affected dogs (1 from each litter) was  used to identify variants that were homozygous or heterozygous in both cases, but  wild type in 217 control genomes of 100 breeds. Immunohistochemistry was used to  assess protein expression. RESULTS: Complete physical, neurological,  electrodiagnostic, and histopathological evaluations confirmed a disorder  affecting sensory and autonomic nerves.

The natural history of the disease is wide ranging and includes  patients without clinical signs as well as those with significant clinical  consequences from cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension and/or congestive  heart failure. The factors that determine which dogs remain asymptomatic and  which develop clinical disease are not known. Disease characteristics could be  breed or family related; some breeds of dogs, particularly the Cavalier King  Charles spaniels, develop MMVD at an early age. The purpose of this study was to  retrospectively characterize MMVD in the miniature poodle, a commonly affected  breed in which MMVD has not been well characterized. Thirty-two miniature poodles  met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 11±three years. Clinical signs included  exercise intolerance, syncope and coughing. Eighteen dogs were classified as  ACVIM Stage B1, 12 as stage B2, and two as stage C. Mean vertebral heart scale  (VHS) was 10.2 (±standard deviation of 0.9); 15 of 28 dogs had a VHS <10.3. One  dog had radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure. Mean diastolic left  ventricle dimension normalized to body weight was 1.6 (±0.4) and mean systolic  was 0.8 (±0.3). Mitral valve prolapse was subjectively classified as mild or  moderate in 19 dogs and severe in two. In the miniature poodles reported here,  MMVD appears to be a fairly late onset disease and often is a mild phenotype.","2019-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","94-97","","","244","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the Gly661Arg  variant of ADAMTS10 causes glaucoma by genotyping dogs of various breeds affected  and unaffected by primary glaucoma. METHODS: Dogs of various breeds, affected or  unaffected with primary glaucoma, were genotyped for the Gly661Arg variant of  ADAMTS10, as well as 7 other nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in other genes in the beagle POAG locus that segregate with disease. Alternate  allele frequencies were calculated with 95% confidence intervals and comparisons  made to expected allele frequency relative to disease prevalence or between cases  and controls. RESULTS: For the nonsynonymous SNPs other than the ADAMTS10  variant, control dogs were identified that were homozygous for the alternative  alleles, ruling out those variants as causative. None of the nonsynonymous SNPs  were found associated with primary glaucoma in American cocker spaniels. The  Gly661Arg variant of ADAMTS10 was the only variant with minor allele frequency  consistent with the prevalence of primary glaucoma in the general beagle  population. The only dog found homozygous for the Gly661Arg variant of ADAMTS10  was an affected beagle, unrelated to the POAG colony.

ANIMALS: 216  CKCSs and 58 non-CKCS dogs. PROCEDURES: Magnetic resonance and computed  tomographic images of the head and craniocervical junction region of patients  evaluated because of suspected CLM were assessed for cerebellar compression (CC),  ventral spinal cord compression at the C1-C2 articulation (medullary kinking),  and dorsal spinal cord compression at the C1-C2 articulation (dorsal  compression). A compression index was calculated for each of these 3 locations in  each dog. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine  whether breed (CKCS vs non-CKCS) and compression index values were associated  with the presence of other craniocervical junction abnormalities. RESULTS: All  274 dogs had CC; medullary kinking was identified in 187 (68.2%) and dorsal  compression was identified in 104 (38.0%). Atlantooccipital overlapping (AOO) was  identified in 76 (27.7%) dogs. Breed of dog (CKCS vs non-CKCS) and value of CC  index were the only significant predictors of AOO. The CKCSs had an almost 5-fold  decrease in risk of AOO, compared with the non-CKCS dogs, and the risk of AOO  nearly doubled for every 10% increase in CC index.

DESIGN: Retrospective study of 110 diagnosed with primary IMHA at the University  of Melbourne Veterinary Clinic and Hospital. RESULTS: In total, 80 of the dogs  (72.7%) were discharged from hospital and 48 of 65 (73.8%) dogs available for  follow-up were known to be alive at 1 year, giving an overall 1-year survival of  48 (50.5%) of 95 dogs for which survival data were available.

This case report describes the first encephalitis  associated with antibodies against the γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA(A)R)  in a dog. A young male intact Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was presented with  recent onset of initial multiple generalized tonic-clonic seizures progressing  into a status epilepticus.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed breed-specific anatomical  abnormalities. Standard CSF analysis was unremarkable. Despite treatment with  multiple antiseizure medications (ASMs) seizures and behavior abnormalities  sustained. Immunotherapy with dexamethasone was started on the fifth day after  disease manifestation. This led to rapid improvement of clinical signs. An  extensive antibody search in CSF and serum demonstrated a neuropil staining  pattern on a tissue-based assay compatible with GABA(A)R antibodies. The  diagnosis was confirmed by binding of serum and CSF antibodies to GABA(A)R  transfected Human Embryonic Kidney cells. The serum titer was 1:320, the CSF  titer 1:2. At the control visit 4.5 weeks after start of immunotherapy, the dog  was clinically normal. The GABA(A)R antibody titer in serum had strongly  decreased.

Thus, for  example, the pug keeps a snub nose like that observed in neonate dogs in general.  However, little is known how far intranasal structures like the turbinal skeleton  are also affected. In the present study, we provide the first detailed  morphological and morphometric analyses on the turbinal skeleton of pug, Japanese  chin, pekingese, King Charles spaniel, and Cavalier. In order to elucidate how a  shortened snout affects turbinal shape, size, and density, our sample covers  different degrees of brachycephaly. Macerated skulls of 1 juvenile and 17 adult  individuals were investigated by μCT and virtual 3D reconstructions. In addition,  histological serial sections of two prenatal and one neonate whippet were taken  into account. All investigated postnatal stages show three frontoturbinals and  three ethmoturbinals similar to longer snouted breeds, whereas the number of  interturbinals is reduced. The shape of the entire turbinal skeleton simplifies  with decreasing snout length, that is, within a minimized nasal cavity the  turbinals decrease proportionally in surface area and surface density due to a  looser arrangement. We interpret these apparent reductions as a result of spatial  constraint which affects postnatal appositional bone growth and the position of  the turbinals inside the nasal cavity. The turbinal skeleton of brachycephalic  dogs arrests at an early ontogenetic stage, corresponding with previous studies  on the dermal bones. Hence, we assume an association between the growth of  intranasal structures and facial elongation.","2021-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","154-189","","1","304","","Anat Rec (Hoboken)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The Authors.

PROCEDURE: A  7 year old neutered male English springer spaniel (case 1) and a 7 year old  neutered male Labrador mix (case 2) were presented for evaluation of an  intrairidal mass OS. RESULTS: Complete ophthalmic examination revealed a large,  dorsonasal, well-demarcated, intrairidal mass OS. A tan to pink intrairidal mass  extending into the iridocorneal angle (case 1) and a pigmented intrairidal mass  (case 2) were present. B-mode ultrasonography showed a focal, soft tissue,  homogenous mass within the uvea adjacent to and contacting the lens. Neither pars  plana involvement nor vitreal extension was present. A postero-anterior  cyclo-iridectomy was performed through a polyhedral scleral flap. Thermocautery  was used to complete the cyclo-iridectomy (case 1) and partial iridectomy (case  2) to excise the mass en bloc. Histopathology revealed a completely excised  iridociliary adenoma (case 1) and iris melanocytoma (case 2). The surgery sites  healed without complication.

Neuropsychological studies outlined the cognitive profile of patients  with schizophrenia, that embodied the substantial disturbances in perceptual and  motor processes, spatial functions, verbal and non-verbal memory, processing  speed and executive functioning. Standardized scoring in the majority of the  neurocognitive tests renders the index scores or the achievement indicating the  severity of the cognitive impairment rather than the actual performance by means  of errors. At the same time, the quantitative evaluation may lead to the  situation when two patients with the same index score of the particular cognitive  test, demonstrate qualitatively different performances. This may support the view  why test paradigms that habitually incorporate different cognitive variables  associate weakly, reflecting an ambiguity in the interpretation of noted  cognitive constructs. With minor exceptions, cognitive functions are not  attributed to the localized activity but eventuate from the coordinated activity  in the generally dispersed brain networks. Functional neuroimaging has  progressively explored the connectivity in the brain networks in the absence of  the specific task and during the task processing. The spatio-temporal  fluctuations of the activity of the brain areas detected in the resting state and  being highly reproducible in numerous studies, resemble the activation and  communication patterns during the task performance. Relatedly, the activation in  the specific brain regions oftentimes is attributed to a number of cognitive  processes. Given the complex organization of the cognitive functions, it becomes  crucial to designate the roles of the brain networks in relation to the specific  cognitive functions. One possible approach is to identify the commonalities of  the deficits across the number of cognitive tests or, common errors in the  various tests and identify their common ""denominators"" in the brain networks. The  qualitative characterization of cognitive performance might be beneficial in  addressing diffuse cognitive alterations presumably caused by the dysconnectivity  of the distributed brain networks. Therefore, in the review, we use this approach  in the description of standardized tests in the scope of potential errors in  patients with schizophrenia with a subsequent reference to the brain networks.","2018","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1027","","","9","","Front Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 30026711  PMCID: PMC6042473","","","","fMRI; schizophrenia; brain networks; cognitive deficits; cognitive tests; errors; lesions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although participants with  schizophrenia show aberrant functional connectivity in brain networks, these  between-group differences have a limited diagnostic utility. Novel methods of  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses, such as machine learning (ML), may  help bring neuroimaging from the bench to the bedside. Here, we used ML to  differentiate participants with a first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum  disorder (FES) from healthy controls based on resting-state functional  connectivity (rsFC). METHOD: We acquired resting-state functional MRI data from  63 patients with FES who were individually matched by age and sex to 63 healthy  controls. We applied linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) to rsFC within  the default mode network, the salience network and the central executive network.  RESULTS: The SVM applied to the rsFC within the salience network distinguished  the FES from the control participants with an accuracy of 73.0% (p = 0.001),  specificity of 71.4% and sensitivity of 74.6%. The classification accuracy was  not significantly affected by medication dose, or by the presence of psychotic  symptoms. The functional connectivity within the default mode or the central  executive networks did not yield classification accuracies above chance level.  CONCLUSIONS: Seed-based functional connectivity maps can be utilized for  diagnostic classification, even early in the course of schizophrenia. The  classification was probably based on trait rather than state markers, as symptoms  or medications were not significantly associated with classification accuracy.  Our results support the role of the anterior insula/salience network in the  pathophysiology of FES.","2016-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2695-2704","","13","46","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27451917","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; machine learning; Adult; Young Adult; Connectome/*methods; salience network; *Support Vector Machine; Cerebral Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; First-episode schizophrenia spectrum; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Schizophrenia/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Canine  mammary cancer is an example of such a disease. However, the underlying inherited  risk factors for canine mammary tumours (CMTs) are still largely unknown. In this  study, 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ten human cancer-associated  genes were genotyped in two different datasets in order to identify genes/alleles  associated with the development of CMTs. The first dataset consisted of English  Springer Spaniel (ESS) CMT cases and controls. ESS is a dog breed known to be at  increased risk of developing CMTs. In the second dataset, dogs from breeds known  to have a high frequency of CMTs were compared to dogs from breeds with a lower  occurrence of these tumours. RESULTS: We found significant associations to CMT  for SNPs and haplotypes in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene in the ESS  material (best PBonf = 0.021). A large number of SNPs, among them several SNPs in  ESR1, showed significantly different allele frequencies between the high and low  risk breed groups (best PBonf = 8.8E-32, best PBPerm = 0.076). CONCLUSIONS: The  identification of CMT-associated SNPs in ESR1 in two independent datasets  suggests that this gene might be involved in CMT development. These findings also  support that CMT may serve as a good model for human breast cancer research.","2013-04-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","69","","","9","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23574728  PMCID: PMC3637093","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Risk Factors; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Alleles; Haplotypes/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics; Genetic Association Studies/veterinary; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*genetics; Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics; Sequence Alignment/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical, histological and genetic approaches were used  in the study of an 8-month-old Cocker Spaniel dog and a 3-year-old mixed-breed  Pitbull, both showing a female phenotype, clitoromegaly and male behavior. A  normal female karyotype (2n = 78,XX) was noticed, and polymerase chain reaction  failed to detect SRY in genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes of  both dogs. The reproductive tract was removed by standard ovariohysterectomy and  processed for histology. Thereafter, a normal female phenotype was reconstructed  by vaginoplasty. Histological examination revealed bilateral ovotestis in both  cases: the gonads showed immature testicular parenchyma containing seminiferous  tubules, Sertoli and Leydig cells, but no signs of spermatogenesis, together with  differently developed ovarian follicles containing oocytes. In the ovotestes,  steroidogenesis was detected by P450c17-immunoreactivity in Leydig cells as well  as in theca cells, whereas no MIS-immunoreactivity was shown by the Sertoli  cells. Genital tracts of Wolffian and Müllerian origin co-existed in both  subjects. Both dogs belong to the very rare cases in which testicular tissue  develops in the absence of the key gene, SRY. Up to date very few genetic events  have been associated with this abnormal sexual differentiation: SOX9  over-expression and RSPO1 mutation. Nevertheless, neither of them has been found  in these dogs.","2012","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","135-142","","1-3","6","","Sex Dev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 S.

High circulating 5HT concentration is a potential source of increased  signaling, and serum 5HT concentrations have not been previously reported in dogs  with DMVD. HYPOTHESIS: Dogs with DMVD and small breed dogs predisposed to DMVD  have higher serum 5HT concentrations than large breed controls. ANIMALS: Fifty  dogs affected with DMVD, 34 dogs predisposed to DMVD but without cardiac murmur  or echocardiographic evidence of DMVD, and 36 healthy large breed control dogs.  METHODS: Prospective analysis. Serum 5HT concentration was measured by an ELISA  test. RESULTS: Median serum 5HT concentration was significantly higher in dogs  with DMVD and in dogs predisposed to DMVD as compared with controls (DMVD, 765.5  ng/mL [interquartile range, 561.3-944.4]; predisposed, 774.9 ng/mL [528.3-1,026];  control, 509.8 ng/mL [320.8-708.8]; P= .0001). Subgroup analysis of predisposed  dogs indicated significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs than in other breeds (CKCS, 855.0 ng/mL  [635.8-1,088]; non-CKCS, 554.2 ng/mL [380.6-648.4]; P= .0023). Age, platelet  count, and platelet morphology were not correlated with 5HT concentration in any  group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Dogs with DMVD had significantly  higher serum 5HT concentrations when compared with large breed control dogs.  Healthy CKCS dogs had significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations than other  healthy dogs predisposed to DMVD.

PROCEDURES: Two dogs (English  Springer Spaniel--ESS, Golden Retriever--GR) and one cat (Domestic Long Haired)  were presented with a 2-14-day history of visual deficits and reduced pupillary  light reflexes. Investigations included physical, ophthalmologic and neurological  examination as well as hematology, serum biochemistry, MRI of the head and  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. RESULTS: MRI changes included thickening of  the sphenoid bone and a loss of normal bone marrow signal on T1W MRI. Enhancement  of the sphenoid bones, ventral meninges and ventral surface of the brain was  present using paramagnetic contrast medium. CSF analysis was abnormal in the two  dogs with increased cellularity, neutrophilic pleocytosis, intracellular bacteria  and increased total protein in one, and with lymphocytic pleocytosis in another.  CSF analysis was normal in the cat. An underlying cause for the osteomyelitis  could not be identified. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3-6 weeks  combined with anti-inflammatory medications proved effective. Full clinical  recovery occurred with no relapse during the follow up time of 7 (ESS) and 4  (Domestic Long Haired) years. The GR relapsed 10 months after treatment and  recovered following a second 3-week course of broad-spectrum antibiotics with no  relapse during the following 3 years. CONCLUSION: Visual pathway deficits in dogs  and cats may be due to sphenoid bone osteomyelitis. MRI and CSF analysis can  assist diagnosing this potentially treatable condition. To the authors' knowledge  this is the first report of sphenoid bone osteomyelitis in these species.","2009-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","71-77","","2","12","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19261160  PMCID: PMC7169348","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prednisolone/therapeutic use; Dog Diseases/drug therapy/*pathology; Cats; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use; Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use; Carbazoles/therapeutic use; Blindness/complications/pathology/*veterinary; Cat Diseases/drug therapy/*pathology; Osteomyelitis/complications/drug therapy/pathology/*veterinary; Sphenoid Bone/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical case report. ANIMALS: A  4-year-old male castrated cocker spaniel. METHODS: Immediate reconstruction of  the left mandible (5 cm gap) was performed after complete excision of a complex  odontoma. Locking plate fixation was applied immediately before complete excision  of the mass. Fixation was removed, then after partial mandibulectomy, including  all abnormal tissue, restored to achieve occlusion. The resulting mandibular  defect was filled with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2)  delivered in an absorbable collagen sponge containing hydroxyapatite/tricalcium  phosphate granules (compression resistant matrix [CRM]). RESULTS: New bone growth  was evident radiographically and on palpation at 3 months. Bony remodeling was  evident during follow-up examinations up to 26 months. Bone collected by biopsy  at the graft site at 7 months had robust new bone formation and evidence of  continued remodeling. Only minor complications (repeated intraoral plate  exposure) were encountered postoperatively and were easily resolved. CONCLUSIONS:  An osteoinductive factor (rhBMP-2/CRM) was successfully used as a graft  substitute in immediate reconstruction of a large mandibular defect. CLINICAL  RELEVANCE: Immediate reconstruction of large mandibular defects with  osteoinductive materials as a graft substitute may be a viable alternative to  partial mandibular resection or radiation therapy for benign odontogenic tumors  in dogs.","2007-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","752-759","","8","36","","Vet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18067615","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Treatment Outcome; Dog Diseases/*surgery; Bone Plates/veterinary; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*therapeutic use; Mandible/*growth & development/surgery; Mandibular Neoplasms/surgery/*veterinary; Odontoma/surgery/*veterinary; Transforming Growth Factor beta/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three and a half percent of the suction biopsies  and 22.6 percent of the forceps biopsies were unsuitable for examination, making  a diagnosis impossible in 9 dogs, and in 0.4 percent antral mucosa was present.  Biopsies could be obtained from the proximal one third of the small intestine.  The normal histology, including mean villous length, its standard deviation and  its range is described in the 17 control dogs. A classification of enteritis in  dogs is given. Villous atrophy without enteritis was found in 55 dogs with  chronic diarrhea; 51 dogs had moderate and four severe villous atrophy. Villous  atrophy combined with enteritis was found in 93 dogs, 57 of which had  lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, 14 had eosinophilic enteritis, six catarrhal,  four ulcerative, 11 a combination of lymphocytic-plasmacytic and eosinophilic  enteritis and one dog had a combination of lymphocytic-plasmacytic and catarrhal  enteritis. Enteritis without villous atrophy was found in 50 dogs: 39 had  lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, four eosinophilic, two catarrhal, one purulent  (microabscesses), three a combination of lymphocytic-plasmacytic and eosinophilic  enteritis and one dog had focal necrosis. Twelve dogs showed a lymphosarcoma and  in eight other dogs a differential diagnosis of lymphosarcoma and/or enteritis  was made. One carcinoma was found. Other findings were hemorrhages, oedema,  erosions, muscular hypertrophy in the villi, an increased or decreased number of  intraepithelial lymphocytes, an increased or decreased number of goblet cells,  lymphangiectasia, crypt cysts, crypt abscesses and gastric metaplasia. Some  breeds, such as the German Shepherd dog, Bouvier des Flandres, Spaniel, Collie,  Great Dane and Retriever appear to be more susceptible than other breeds for  villous atrophy and enteritis. A slight prevalence of the German Shepherd dog,  Doberman Pinscher and Rottweiler was also observed for eosinophilic enteritis.  Mild villous atrophy is mostly found in dogs aged 0-4 years, whereas severe  villous atrophy is found in dogs older than 4 years. Further breed, age or sex  predisposition could not be found. The method appears especially useful for  diffuse mucosal lesions of the proximal small intestine.","1990-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","401-416","","6","37","","Zentralbl Veterinarmed A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 2120863","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Chronic Disease; Biopsy/veterinary; Diarrhea/pathology/*veterinary; Duodenum/*pathology; Jejunum/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, CR may contribute to the heterogeneity of cognitive deficits  observed in schizophrenia. This study aimed to assess the relationships between  CR, cognition and quality of life in first-episode (FES) patients. A total of 137  patients with either ICD-10 schizophrenia or ""acute and transient psychotic  disorders"" diagnosis, and 62 healthy controls had completed a comprehensive  assessment of six cognitive domains: speed of processing, attention, working  memory/flexibility, verbal memory, visual memory, and abstraction/executive  functioning. CR was calculated from the participants' education, premorbid IQ,  and socioeconomic status. The results suggested that in patients, CR was  positively related to cognitive performance in all domains, explaining 42.6% of  the variance observed in cognition overall. Effects of CR in the control group  were limited to three domains: speed of processing, abstraction/executive  function and working memory/flexibility. These results suggest that CR largely  contributes to cognitive variations present in FES patients. In addition, CR was  negatively related to the social construct of patients' quality of life, and  positively to symptom severity and general functioning.","2022-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","114479","","","310","","Psychiatry Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to explore whether motor  activity alone, as assessed by longitudinal actigraphy, can be used to classify  accurately BD patients and healthy controls (HCs) into their respective groups.  METHODS: Ninety-day actigraphy records from 25 interepisode BD patients (ie,  Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale  (YMRS) < 15) and 25 sex- and age-matched HCs were used in order to identify  latent actigraphic biomarkers capable of discriminating between BD patients and  HCs. Mean values and time variations of a set of standard actigraphy features  were analyzed and further validated using the random forest classifier. RESULTS:  Using all actigraphy features, this method correctly assigned 88%  (sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 91%) of BD patients and HCs to their respective  group. The classification success may be confounded by differences in employment  between BD patients and HCs. When motor activity features resistant to the  employment status were used (the strongest feature being time variation of  intradaily variability, Cohen's d = 1.33), 79% of the subjects  (sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 81%) were correctly classified. CONCLUSION: A  machine-learning actigraphy-based model was capable of distinguishing between  interepisode BD patients and HCs solely on the basis of motor activity. The  classification remained valid even when features influenced by employment status  were omitted. The findings suggest that temporal variability of actigraphic  parameters may provide discriminative power for differentiating between BD  patients and HCs while being less affected by employment status.","2022-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","82-92","","1","27","","CNS Spectr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32883376","","","","Humans; Biomarkers; Circadian Rhythm; Motor Activity; *Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis; actigraphy; Actigraphy; Bipolar disorder; circadian rhythm; classification; sleep","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Repeated treatment with  appropriate antimicrobials selected on the basis of bacterial culture and  antimicrobial susceptibility results would result in clinical improvement, but  recurrence of clinical signs was observed within days after discontinuation of  treatment. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Ultrasound examination revealed a tubular,  fluid-filled structure dorsal to the bladder that extended from the midlevel of  the bladder to the cranial pole of the prostate. Mineralized foci within a  heterogeneous prostatic parenchyma were also noted. Dilation of the right ductus  deferens (DD) was observed during exploratory laparotomy. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME:  Both DD were surgically removed, and the prostate was biopsied. The  histopathological diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma involving the right  DD and the prostate. The dog was treated with meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg [0.05 mg/lb],  p.o., q 24 h) for 9 months after diagnosis before being euthanized. CLINICAL  RELEVANCE: Because the normal DD is rarely visualized during abdominal  ultrasonography in dogs, identification of a tubular, fluid-filled structure  dorsal to the bladder may indicate an abnormal DD. Transitional cell carcinoma of  the DD should be included in the differential diagnoses of affected patients  examined for clinical signs involving the urinary tract.","2012-02-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","446-449","","4","240","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22309017","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Euthanasia, Animal; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy; *Vas Deferens; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Meloxicam; Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary; Testicular Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary; Thiazines/therapeutic use; Thiazoles/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A  third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (59%) and sick sinus syndrome (SSS; 27%)  were the most common indications, along with a high-grade second-degree AV block  (9%) and atrial standstill (5%). The most common breeds identified were Labrador  Retriever (n = 16; 11 with a third-degree AV block), American Cocker Spaniel (n =  14; 10 with SSS), and Miniature Schnauzer (n = 13; all with SSS). Common  presenting complaints were syncope (n = 66) and exercise intolerance or lethargy  (n = 25). Half of the dogs (n = 52) had a history of acute onset of clinical  signs (<2 weeks). Mean survival time for the 60 dogs who died during the study  period was 2.2 years (range, 0.1-5.8 years). Major complications occurred in 13%  of dogs and included lead displacement (n = 7), sensing problems that led to  syncope (n = 3), infection at the pacemaker site (n = 1), bleeding (n = 1), and  ventricular fibrillation during implantation (n = 1; successfully defibrillated).  Minor complications occurred in 11 dogs (11%). The success rate of transvenous AP  implantation was comparatively high (all dogs survived the first 48 hours), and  the complication rate was comparatively low when compared with a previous  multicenter study, most likely because of how commonly the procedure was  performed and supervisory experience.","2006-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","877-884","","4","20","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16955812","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Time Factors; Dog Diseases/*therapy; Sick Sinus Syndrome/therapy/*veterinary; Heart Block/therapy/*veterinary; Pacemaker, Artificial/adverse effects/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also claimed that more scientific evidence is needed  to demonstrate to what extent dogs actually detect drugs. The aim of this  research was to assess experimentally, but in actual training and testing  environments used by the Polish police, how effective dogs trained by the police  were at illicit substance detection depending on factors such as type of drug,  dog breed, dog experience with the searching site, and drug odor residuals. 68  Labrador retrievers, 61 German shepherds, 25 Terriers and 10 English Cocker  Spaniels, of both sexes in each breed, were used. Altogether 1219 experimental  searching tests were conducted. On average, hidden drug samples were indicated by  dogs after 64s searching time, with 87.7% indications being correct and 5.3%  being false. In 7.0% of trials dogs failed to find the drug sample within 10min.  The ranking of drugs from the easiest to the most difficult to detect was:  marijuana, hashish, amphetamine, cocaine, heroin. German shepherds were superior  to other breeds in giving correct indications while Terriers showed relatively  poor detection performance. Dogs were equally efficient at searching in  well-known vs. unknown rooms with strange (i.e., non-target novelty) odors (83.2%  correct indications), but they were less accurate when searching outside or  inside cars (63.5% and 57.9% correct indications respectively). During police  examination trials the dogs made more false alerts, fewer correct indications and  searching time was longer compared to the final stage of the training. The drug  odor may persist at a site for at least 48h. Our experiments do not confirm the  recent reports, based on drug users' opinions, of low drug detection efficiency.  Usefulness of drug detection dogs has been demonstrated here, even if their  effectiveness may not be 100%, but different factors have to be taken into  consideration to assure maximum effectiveness.","2014-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","112-118","","","237","","Forensic Sci Int","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this  study was to establish canine hematologic reference intervals according to  International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical and Laboratory  Standards Institute guidelines using the Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzer.  METHODS: Blood samples from 132 healthy purebred dogs from France, selected to  represent the most prevalent canine breeds in France, were analyzed. Blood smears  were scored for platelet (PLT) aggregates. Reference intervals were established  using the nonparametric method. PLT and RBC counts obtained by impedance and  optical methods were compared. Effects of sex and age on reference intervals were  determined. RESULTS: The correlation between impedance (I) and optical (O)  measurements of RBC and PLT counts was excellent (Pearson r=.99 and .98,  respectively); however, there were significant differences between the 2 methods  (Student's paired t-test, P<.0001). Differences between sexes were not  significant except for HCT, PLT-I, and PLT-O. WBC, lymphocyte, and neutrophil  counts decreased significantly with age (ANOVA, P<.05). Median eosinophil counts  were higher in Brittany Spaniels (1.87 × 10(9) /L), Rottweilers (1.41 × 10(9)  /L), and German Shepherd dogs (1.38 × 10(9) /L) than in the overall population  (0.9 × 10(9) /L).

Hereditary canine spinal muscular  atrophy (HCSMA), a fatal inherited motor neuron disease in Brittany spaniels,  shares many clinical and pathological features with human motor neuron disease,  including FALS.

Extending this analysis, we  have evaluated SOD1 as a candidate for HCSMA. The 462 bp SOD1 coding region in  the dog encodes 153 amino acid residues and exhibits more than 83% and 79%  sequence identity to other mammalian homologues at both the nucleotide and amino  acid levels, respectively. The canine SOD1 gene maps to CFA31 close to syntenic  group 13 on the radiation hybrid (RH) map in the vicinity of sodium myo/inositol  transporter (SMIT) gene. The human orthologous SOD1 and SMIT genes have been  localized on HSA 21q22.1 and HSA 21q21, respectively, confirming the conservation  of synteny between dog syntenic group 13 and HSA 21.

Smaller breeds and older dogs were  overrepresented, with 4/14 Cocker Spaniels. Most dogs presented for nonspecific  clinical signs such as vomiting, anorexia and lethargy. Abdominal pain, icterus  and hyperthermia were the most common findings on physical examination. All dogs  except one had serum elevation of total bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase,  alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase. All dogs were diagnosed  with a gallbladder mucocele upon histologic and/or macroscopic evaluation.  Ultrasonographically, mucoceles are characterized by the appearance of the  stellate or finely striated bile patterns and differ from biliary sludge by the  absence of gravity dependent bile movement. On ultrasound, gallbladder wall  thickness and wall appearance were variable and nonspecific. The cystic or common  bile duct were normal sized in 5 dogs although all 5 had evidence of biliary  obstruction at surgery or necropsy. Loss of gallbladder wall integrity and/or  gallbladder rupture were present in 50% of the dogs, all located in the fundus.  Gallbladder wall discontinuity on ultrasound indicated rupture whereas neither  bile patterns predicted the likelihood of gallbladder rupture. Pericholecystic  hyperechoic fat or fluid were suggestive of but not diagnostic for a gallbladder  rupture. Cholecystectomy appears to be an appropriate treatment for mucoceles, if  not to treat a gallbladder rupture, at least in most dogs to prevent it since  gallbladder wall necrosis was identified by histology in 9 of 10 dogs. Mucosal  hyperplasia was present in all gallbladders examined histologically. Positive  aerobic bacterial culture was obtained from bile in 6 of 9 dogs. Cholecystitis  was diagnosed histologically in 5 dogs and 4 dogs had signs of gallbladder  infection solely upon bacterial bile culture. Gallbladder infection was not  present with all the mucoceles suggesting that biliary stasis and mucosal  hyperplasia may be the primary factors involved in mucocele formation. Based on  the results of our study, we suggest two alternate courses of action in the  presence of a distended gallbladder with an immobile ultrasonographic stellate or  finely striated bile pattern: a cholecystectomy when clinical or biochemical  signs of hepatobiliary disease are present or a medical treatment (antibiotics  and choleretics) and patient monitoring by follow-up ultrasound examinations when  the patient does not have clinical or biochemical abnormalities.

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an  important cofactor for production of the endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric  oxide (NO). Under conditions of oxidative stress, BH4 is oxidized to the  biologically inactive form dihydrobiopterin (BH2). Thus, plasma concentrations of  BH2 and BH4 may reflect ED and oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: To determine plasma  concentrations of BH2 and BH4 in dogs with different degrees of MMVD. ANIMALS:  Eighty-four privately owned dogs grouped according to ACVIM guidelines (37  healthy control dogs including 13 Beagles and 24 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  [CKCSs], 33 CKCSs with MMVD of differing severity including 18 CKCSs [group B1]  and 15 CKCSs [group B2], and 14 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of  congestive heart failure [CHF] because of MMVD [group C]). METHODS: Dogs  underwent clinical examination including echocardiography. Plasma concentrations  of BH2 and BH4 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with  fluorescence detection. RESULTS: Higher plasma BH4 and BH2 concentrations were  found with dogs in CHF compared with all other groups (control, B1 and B2; P ≤  .001). Females had higher concentrations of BH4 and BH4/BH2 (P ≤ .0003). BH4/BH2  was found to decrease with age (P < .0001). Cardiovascular risk factors in humans  such as passive smoking (P ≤ .01) and increased body weight (P ≤ .009) were  associated with lower BH4 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:  Age, sex, body weight, passive smoking, and cardiac status are associated with  plasma biopterin concentration in dogs. Additional studies should clarify the  clinical implications of the findings.","2014-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1520-1526","","5","28","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25274442  PMCID: PMC4895593","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Risk Factors; Echocardiography/veterinary; Severity of Illness Index; Dog Diseases/*blood; *Mitral Valve; Heart Valve Diseases/blood/*veterinary; Mitral regurgitation; Endothelial dysfunction; Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/blood; Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/veterinary; Oxidative stress; Tetrahydrobiopterin; Tobacco Smoke Pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: Ninety privately owned dogs: 70 CKCS with  variable MMVD severity and 20 non-CKCS in CHF secondary to MMVD. METHODS: Dogs  were prospectively recruited and divided into 5 MMVD severity groups based on  history, breed, and physical and echocardiographic examination findings.  Holter-derived variables included heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR),  and arrhythmia evaluated from 24-hour Holter recordings. RESULTS: In CKCS, 18 of  26 HRV (all P < .0002) and 3 of 9 arrhythmia (all P < .0004) variables decreased  with increasing MMVD, whereas minimum and mean HR (all P < .0001) increased with  increasing MMVD severity. An arrhythmia variable representing sinus arrhythmia  (""premature normals"") (P < .0001) and the HRV variable triangular index (TI) (P <  .0001) could distinguish CKCS with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation from  CKCS in CHF in specific intervals.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to  investigate platelet function in clinically healthy dogs of 4 different breeds by  whole-blood aggregometry and with a point-of-care platelet function analyzer  (PFA-100), and to evaluate the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)  administration on the results from both methods. METHODS: Forty-five clinically  healthy dogs (12 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [CKCS], 12 Cairn Terriers, 10  Boxers, and 11 Labrador Retrievers) were included in the study. Platelet function  was assessed by whole-blood aggregation with ADP (1, 5, 10, and 20 microM) as  agonist and by PFA-100 using collagen and epinephrine (Col + Epi) and Col + ADP  as agonists. Plasma thromboxane B(2) concentration was determined by an enzyme  immunoassay. To investigate the effect of ASA, 10 dogs were dosed daily (75 or  250 mg ASA orally) for 4 consecutive days. RESULTS: A higher platelet aggregation  response was found in CKCS compared to the other breeds. Longer PFA-100 closure  time (Col + Epi) was found in Cairn Terriers compared to Boxers. Plasma  thromboxane B(2) concentration was not statistically different between groups.  Administration of ASA prolonged the PFA-100 closure times, using Col + Epi (but  not Col + ADP) as agonists. Furthermore, ASA resulted in a decrease in  whole-blood platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet function is influenced by  breed, depending upon the methodology applied. However, the importance of these  breed differences remains to be investigated. The PFA-100 method with Col + Epi  as agonists, and ADP-induced platelet aggregation appear to be sensitive to ASA  in dogs.","2007-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","267-273","","3","36","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17806075","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Cells, Cultured; Dogs/*classification/genetics/*physiology; Aspirin/*pharmacology; Blood Platelets/*drug effects/*physiology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Health; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/pharmacology; Point-of-Care Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirteen Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs (Group A) were  evaluated over an eight year period (1990-1998), each with a history of either a  unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness. The cause of lameness was localized to  the elbow region. Of the thirteen pigs, twenty-one elbows were evaluated  radiographically. Pigs ranged in age from six months to four years old. All pigs  over the age of seven months showed radiographic evidence of elbow degenerative  joint disease. Fractures involving the medial aspect of the humeral condyle were  identified in 8/21 studies (38%). A well-defined linear intracondylar articular  lucency was identified in 7/21 studies (33%) on the craniocaudal projection. The  site of this lucency corresponded to the location of the articular component of  the fractures seen involving the humeral condyle. The elbows of five pot-bellied  pigs with no known history of forelimb lameness or trauma (Group B) were  evaluated radiographically following euthanasia. All five pigs were of unknown  age and gender. An intracondylar vertical linear lucency was identified  bilaterally in three pigs (60%). Concurrent degenerative joint disease was  present in all instances. The remaining two pigs were radiographically normal.  Computed tomography of the elbows was performed in one affected pig from Group B.  The radiographic findings in this pig were verified. Histopathology of the right  elbow of this affected pig was diagnostic for incomplete endochondral  ossification of the humeral condyle. A similar condition involving the humeral  condyle has been previously described in Cocker and Brittany Spaniels. These  canine breeds also have a high incidence of humeral condylar fractures. It is  postulated that Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs are similarly prone to humeral  condylar fractures, even in the absence of known trauma, due to incomplete  ossification of the humeral condyle.","2000-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","147-153","","2","41","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10779075","","","","Animals; Radiography; Forelimb/diagnostic imaging; Swine; *Swine, Miniature; Bone Diseases, Developmental/complications/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary; Humeral Fractures/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*veterinary; Lameness, Animal/*diagnostic imaging/etiology; Swine Diseases/*diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Histopathologically,  degeneration is confined to motor neurons with accumulation of phosphorylated  neurofilaments in axonal internodes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a kinase  related to the cell cycle kinase cdc2, phosphorylates neurofilaments and  regulates neurofilament dynamics. We examined CDK5 activity, protein levels, and  cellular immunoreactivity in nervous tissue from dogs with HCSMA, from closely  age-matched controls and from dogs with other neurological diseases. On  immunoblot analysis, CDK5 protein levels were increased in the HCSMA dogs (by  approximately 1.5-fold in both the cytosolic and the particulate fractions). CDK5  activity was significantly increased (by approximately 3-fold) in the particulate  fractions in the HCSMA dogs compared to all controls. The finding that CDK5  activity was increased in the young HCSMA homozygotes with the accelerated form  of the disease, who do not show axonal swellings histologically, suggests that  alterations in CDK5 occurs early in the pathogenesis, prior to the development of  significant neurofilament pathology. Immunocytochemically, there was strong CDK5  staining of the nuclei, cytoplasm and axonal processes of the motor neurons in  both control dogs and dogs with HCSMA. Further immunocytochemical studies  demonstrated CDK5 staining where neurofilaments accumulated, in axonal swellings  in the dogs with HCSMA. Our observations suggest phosphorylation-dependent events  mediated by CDK5 occur in canine motor neuron disease.","1998-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1070-1077","","11","57","","J Neuropathol Exp Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9825944","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Reference Values; Immunohistochemistry; Tissue Distribution; *Cyclin-Dependent Kinases; Axons/enzymology; Brain/enzymology; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5; Dog Diseases/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology; Immunoblotting; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/*veterinary; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism; Spinal Cord/enzymology/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A considerable number of  epidemiological studies performed in a variety of canine communities revealed  varied prevalence, and identified associated risk factors, including neutering.  Associations between excessive body weight and certain diseases, including  orthopedic diseases, were also reported. However, risk factors and disease  associations of overweight and obesity in a larger population of dogs seen in  recent years at a single referral veterinary hospital remains undefined. The  present study utilized descriptive statistics and logistic regression models to  characterize prevalence, risk factors, and disease associations of excessive body  weight (both overweight and obesity) in 40,038 dogs that visited the Veterinary  Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis from January  2006 to December 2015. The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity in 40,038  dogs were 21.1% (n = 8461) and 20.2% (n = 8089) respectively. Dogs that were  neutered, female, and considered middle-aged or senior were at increased risk of  overweight and obesity. Certain breed types, including Retriever and Spaniel, and  certain disease processes, including orthopedic diseases, were also at increased  risk of overweight and obesity. Overweight and obesity are prevalent problems,  which can benefit from continual education to raise awareness of the scale of the  problem to both the veterinary community and the general public. Structured  disease surveillance plans monitoring these associated factors also help to guide  further research and to better prevent overweight and obesity.","2022-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","100640","","","48","","Top Companion Anim Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  retrospective study design was used to estimate the 1-year (2016) period  prevalence of overweight status. The clinical records were randomly ordered and  manually validated for dogs with overweight status during 2016. Univariable and  multivariable logistic regression modelling were used to evaluate associations  between risk factors (breed, brachycephalic status, adult bodyweight, bodyweight  relative to breed-sex mean, age, sex-neuter and insurance) and overweight status.  RESULTS: There were 1580 of 22,333 dogs identified as overweight during 2016. The  estimated 1-year period prevalence for overweight status recorded in dogs under  veterinary care was 7.1% (95% confidence interval 6.7-7.4). After accounting for  confounding factors, eight breeds showed increased odds of overweight status  compared with crossbred dogs. The breeds with the highest odds included the Pug  (OR 3.12, 95% confidence interval 2.31 to 4.20), Beagle (OR 2.67, 1.75 to 4.08),  Golden Retriever (OR 2.58, 1.79 to 3.74) and English Springer Spaniel (OR 1.98,  1.31 to 2.98). Being neutered, middle-aged and insured were additionally  associated with overweight status. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Targeted overweight  prevention strategies should be prioritised for predisposed breeds, such as Pugs  and Beagles. The findings additionally raise questions about further preventative  efforts following neutering. The prevalence estimate suggests veterinary  professionals are underreporting overweight status and therefore could be missing  key welfare opportunities.","2021-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","521-530","","7","62","","J Small Anim Pract","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

Corneal swabs yielded  465 bacterial isolates and 220 cultures (46.2%) with no apparent growth (0-5  isolates per culture). The most frequent bacterial genera were Staphylococcus  (32.3%), Streptococcus (19.1%), and Pseudomonas (12.5%), while the most common  bacterial species were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (26.7%), Streptococcus  canis (12%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%). Compared to mixed-breed dogs,  canine breeds most likely to be examined for ulcerative keratitis included Boston  terrier, Cavalier King Charles spaniel, miniature pinscher, pug, rat terrier,  Saint Bernard, shih tzu, and silky terriers. In summer, the likelihood to yield a  negative culture was reduced while the likelihood to culture Pseudomonas species  was increased. Bacteria considered multidrug resistant (MDR, resistant to ≥ 3  antibiotic classes) represented 20% of all canine isolates and were most  prevalent for Staphylococcus species (33%). An alarming, escalating trend of MDR  prevalence was noted between 2016 (5%) and 2020 (34%). Individual ophthalmic  preparations (i.e., single antibiotics or commercially available antibiotic  combinations) with highest efficacy against all bacterial isolates included  chloramphenicol (83%), ceftiofur (79%), amikacin (77%), neomycin-polymyxin  B-bacitracin (77%), and gentamicin (74%). Efficacy of systemic antibiotics and  combinations of ophthalmic preparations was also evaluated. Based on the present  findings, triple antibiotic (Neo-Poly-Bac) is recommended as empirical  monotherapy for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in dogs with simple corneal  ulcers, while a chloramphenicol-ciprofloxacin combination is empirically  recommended for therapeutic management of infected corneal ulcers.

Clinical examination revealed left-eye cataract with a  nonvisible left and a normal right retina on ophthalmoscopy. Neurological  examination revealed absent left-sided menace response and cataract-related  ipsilateral visual impairment, and intermittent left-sided abnormal eye movements  consisted of intermittent, slow, coarse, variable amplitude, vertical movements  of the eye that they were giving the impression of random movements of the eye  within the globe as it was floating (""wandering"" eye) interchangeable with  periods of rest. Blood and infectious diseases tests were unremarkable. Magnetic  resonance imaging of the brain was unremarkable, whilst cerebrospinal fluid  analysis revealed mildly inflammatory in the light of blood contamination. A  presumptive diagnosis of meningoencephalitis of unknown origin was established  and trial with dexamethasone was performed, however nystagmus remained unchanged  2 weeks post-treatment. Therefore, based on the fact that monocular nystagmus  existed since youth and remained static, and the dog was otherwise  neurological-sign-free regardless the discontinuation of steroids, the diagnosis  of meningoencephalitis was considered as unlikely and a presumptive diagnosis of  Heimann - Bielschowsky phenomenon of the left eye due to cataract-related  ipsilateral visual impairment was established. This vergence eye movement  abnormality also known as searching, wandering or amaurotic nystagmus is a  constant or intermittent benign eye movement abnormality mostly related with  vision impairment due to ophthalmological or neurological disease. Heimann -  Bielschowsky phenomenon is an underreported eye abnormality in veterinary  medicine. Although the most common type of eye movement abnormalities seen in  veterinary practice is the bilateral conjugate jerk nystagmus, monocular  nystagmus representing Heimann - Bielschowsky phenomenon exists in animals, it  has been related with partial or complete vision impairment and it should be  recognised by the clinicians.","2020-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","100439","","","40","","Top Companion Anim Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Results from a routine  neurological examination were normal. Examination of histologic sections of  skeletal muscle revealed large accumulations of material in some myofibers. These  deposits were pale, basophilic, somewhat flocculent, and slightly granular with  hematoxylin and eosin stain. Most fascicles examined in sections of limb and  trunk muscles were affected to some degree, with up to 10% of muscle fibers being  involved. Deposits stained strongly with periodic acid-Schiff and were resistant  to digestion by alpha amylase but were removed by incubation with gamma amylase.  Deposits were faintly positive with Gomori's methenamine silver technique and  alcian blue (pH 2.5) and were brown-gray with Lugol's iodine solution but were  negative with other stains. Based on staining characteristics, the deposits  seemed to consist primarily of an amylopectin-like polysaccharide(s). Alcian blue  staining (pH 2.5) was removed by treatment with neuraminidase but not with  hyaluronidase, indicating that some sialic acid residues were also present.  Electron microscopically, the deposits were composed of short granular filaments,  small granules and amorphous material. They were not membrane bound. The  morphologic appearance and staining characteristics of the deposits were  remarkably similar to deposits previously described in human PFK-deficient  myopathy. As expected, total PFK activities were markedly reduced when assayed in  skeletal muscles of this dog. In contrast with other PFK-deficient dogs, muscle  glycogen in this animal was not increased above that of normal dogs.","1990-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1-8","","1","27","","Vet Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2137952","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Dog Diseases/*pathology; Microscopy, Electron; Atrophy; Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII/pathology/*veterinary; Glycogen Storage Disease/*veterinary; Glycogen/analysis; Muscles/analysis/*pathology/ultrastructure; Phosphofructokinase-1/analysis/*deficiency; Polysaccharides/analysis; Splenomegaly/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about the relationship between myxomatous mitral valve  disease (MMVD) and oxidative stress in dogs. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether  clinical stage of MMVD is associated with changes in the plasma concentrations of  certain markers of oxidative stress in clinically healthy dogs and dogs with  MMVD. ANIMALS: Seventy five privately owned dogs: 59 cavalier King Charles  Spaniels (CKCS) with different severities of MMVD and 16 dogs of different breeds  with clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by MMVD. METHODS:  Markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized low-density  lipoprotein (oxLDL), and vitamin E (α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol) were measured  in plasma and their association with clinical stage of MMVD was assessed by  regression analyses. RESULTS: Plasma oxLDL concentration was significantly lower  in female dogs compared with males (P = .01). Significantly higher plasma  γ-tocopherol concentrations were found in neutered (P = .003) dogs. Vitamin E  (α-tocopherol [P = .0004] and γ-tocopherol [P = .003]) was associated with body  condition score (BCS), but the association disappeared when cholesterol was  included in the analyses. All markers of oxidative stress (MDA, oxLDL, and  vitamin E) were positively associated with serum cholesterol concentration (P ≤  .04), but none were associated with clinical stage of MMVD. CONCLUSIONS: In  conclusion, markers of oxidative stress are associated with sex, BCS, neuter  status, and cholesterol. The results cannot confirm a relationship between  oxidative stress and clinical stage of the disease in dogs with MMVD.","2017-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","295-302","","2","31","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Fifty clinically healthy dogs older than I  year (median 5.0 years; interquartile interval 2.6-8.2 years) were studied,  including 9 controls of various breeds, 23 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs)  with no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 9 CKCSs with mild MR (regurgitant  jet occupying 15-50% of the left atrial area), and 9 CKCS with moderate to severe  MR (jet >50%) due to myxomatous valve disease. None of the dogs received  medication. The dogs were given NOx-free water and a diet with a low  concentration of NOx for 96 hours before blood sampling. Multiple linear  regression analysis revealed that dog group, but not gender, age, serum  creatinine concentration, and platelet count, was associated with NOx  concentrations. Control dogs had the same NOx concentration (median 20.0 microM;  interquartile interval 15.1-25.5 microM) as CKCSs without MR (median 18.7 microM;  interquartile interval 15.5-25.9 microM).

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine cytological and bacteriological  features of middle ear effusions in dogs, provide information on histological  features, and further assess the dog as a model of the human disease. ANIMALS:  Sixteen live dogs, 3 postmortem cases of middle ear effusion, and 2 postmortem  controls.

Based on the cytologic,  histologic, and immunohistochemical evaluation of the spleen and liver, the  diagnosis was hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) of GLs. Postoperatively, the  dog was maintained in good condition with chemotherapy (ACNU [nimustine],  L-asparaginase, and prednisolone). However, on day 85, ultrasound-guided  fine-needle aspiration of the liver revealed a proliferation in neoplastic mast  cells not associated with the GLs. The dog was diagnosed with a visceral mast  cell tumor (MCT) originating from the liver. The chemotherapy was switched to  vinblastine and toceranib.

At its  final evolutionary step, treatments are limited to the percutaneous or surgical  valve replacement, whatever the original cause of the degeneration. Understanding  early molecular mechanisms that regulate valve interstitial cells remodeling and  disease progression is challenging and could pave the way for future drugs aiming  to prevent and/or reverse the process. Some valve degenerative processes such as  the carcinoid heart disease, drug-induced valvulopathy and degenerative mitral  valve disease in small-breed dogs are clearly linked to serotonin. The carcinoid  heart is typically characterized by a right-sided valve dysfunction, observed in  patients with carcinoid tumors developed from serotonin-producing gut  enterochromaffin cells. Fenfluramine or ergot derivatives were linked to mitral  and aortic valve dysfunction and share in common the pharmacological property of  being 5-HT(2B) receptor agonists. Finally, some small-breed dogs, such as the  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel are highly prone to degenerative mitral valve  disease with a prevalence of 40% at 4 years-old, 70% at 7 years-old and 100% in  10-year-old animals. This degeneration has been linked to high serum serotonin,  5-HT(2B) receptor overexpression and SERT downregulation. Through the  comprehension of serotonergic mechanisms involved into these specific situations,  new therapeutic approaches could be extended to HVD in general. More recently, a  serotonin dependent/ receptor independent mechanism has been suggested in  congenital mitral valve prolapse through the filamin-A serotonylation. This  review summarizes clinical and molecular mechanisms linking the serotonergic  system and heart valve disease, opening the way for future pharmacological  research in the field.","2019-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","33-42","","","140","","Pharmacol Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The  same data were obtained for dogs with SARD described in the veterinary  literature. RESULTS: Three hundred and two dogs were included from the  ophthalmology practices and 193 dogs from the veterinary literature. Sixty breeds  were present in the study.

We used a  genome-wide association study (GWAS) and targeted resequencing of DNA from just  five dogs to simultaneously map and identify mutations for two distinct inherited  disorders that both affect a single breed, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. We  investigated episodic falling (EF), a paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia,  alongside the phenotypically distinct condition congenital keratoconjunctivitis  sicca and ichthyosiform dermatosis (CKCSID), commonly known as dry eye curly coat  syndrome. EF is characterised by episodes of exercise-induced muscular  hypertonicity and abnormal posturing, usually occurring after exercise or periods  of excitement. CKCSID is a congenital disorder that manifests as a rough coat  present at birth, with keratoconjunctivitis sicca apparent on eyelid opening at  10-14 days, followed by hyperkeratinisation of footpads and distortion of nails  that develops over the next few months. We undertook a GWAS with 31 EF cases, 23  CKCSID cases, and a common set of 38 controls and identified statistically  associated signals for EF and CKCSID on chromosome 7 (P(raw) 1.9×10(-14);  P(genome) = 1.0×10(-5)) and chromosome 13 (P(raw) 1.2×10(-17);  P(genome) = 1.0×10(-5)), respectively. We resequenced both the EF and CKCSID  disease-associated regions in just five dogs and identified a 15,724 bp deletion  spanning three exons of BCAN associated with EF and a single base-pair exonic  deletion in FAM83H associated with CKCSID.

The dog was febrile and, in addition to anterior  uveitis, multifocal hyporeflective lesions were present in the tapetal fundus of  both eyes. The antibody titer for Bartonella vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi was  positive (1 : 512). Aqueous paracentesis was performed for PCR in an attempt to  detect B. vinsonii in the eye but was unsuccessful. The ocular manifestations of  Bartonella infection in humans are currently expanding as more sensitive  serologic and PCR techniques are being developed to identify Bartonella spp. In  addition to optic neuritis and neuroretinitis, retinochoroidal lesions are one of  the most common manifestations of B. henselae infection, and are frequently  accompanied by vitreous or anterior segment inflammation. Diagnosis of a  Bartonella infection in humans can be made on serology alone, in conjunction with  ocular examination findings. The ultimate proof of B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) as a  direct cause of ocular disease would be detection of the infectious agent in the  eye. However, it is unknown at this time whether Bartonella causes ocular disease  primarily, secondarily via an autoimmune reaction, or both. Due to the  difficulties associated with culture of Bartonella spp. and the limitations of  PCR, serology is currently the most useful tool for screening dogs for possible  Bartonella spp. infection. In the case presented here, even though the PCR was  negative, the clinical signs of anterior uveitis and choroiditis might reasonably  be associated with B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) seroreactivity, which was repeatable  on three separate occasions. Clinical improvement was also accompanied by a  post-treatment decrease in B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) seroreactivity, potentially  supporting resolution of Bartonella infection in this dog. This is the first  reported case of a possible association between uveitis, choroiditis and  Bartonella infection in the dog, without clinical manifestations of other organ  or tissue involvement. Future studies based on PCR analysis of intraocular fluids  may clarify the involvement of B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) in dogs with intraocular  inflammatory disease. Furthermore, performing fluorescein angiography in dogs  with elevated Bartonella titers may also prove useful in the identification and  characterization of lesions.","2003-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","299-304","","4","6","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 14641826","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Diagnosis, Differential; Bartonella Infections/diagnosis/*veterinary; Bartonella/*isolation & purification; Choroiditis/diagnosis/*veterinary; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/microbiology/pathology; Uveitis, Anterior/diagnosis/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.","Large animal models of heart failure.","Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine","","0004-8291","10.1111/j.1445-5994.1999.tb00734.x","","Congestive heart failure (HF) is a major focus of medical research. Its incidence has greatly increased in recent decades because of an aging population base and  the increasingly successful treatment of other forms of chronic cardiac disease.  Relevant large animal models of HF should reflect the complex interactions of  cardiac dysfunction, neurohumoral dynamics and peripheral vascular abnormalities  found in human HF. A number of large animal models have been developed,  especially in dogs, sheep and swine, using naturally occurring HF, or single or  combinations of interventions, as instruments to trigger the development of HF.  Naturally occurring HF models are not commonly used because of ethical or  perceived ethical grounds, however, King Charles Cavalier Spaniel and Yucatan  Mini Pig models have been described. Tachycardia induced HF is the most commonly  used HF model. Ventricular pacing at 220-240 bpm results in profound low output,  biventricular, oedematous failure in two to three weeks. Lower pacing rates  result in a more stable, sustainable, lesser degree of failure. Positive features  of this model include 'acceptance', aetiological relevance to patient tachycardia  induced HF, neurohumoral and functional profile similar to most human HF,  relatively low cost simple preparation, ability to manipulate the degree of  failure with pacing rate, reversibility, reliability and a large amount of  published multi species data. Limitations to the use of the model are the rapid  onset, the fact that reversibility is only relevant to the tachycardia induced  patient HF, the absence of hypertrophy in failure, the diminished plasma atrial  natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, absence of ANP of ventricular origin, and the  interference between rapid pacing and therapeutic interventions. Myocardial  damage models of HF include those models induced by ischaemia, eg due to coronary  occlusion (ligation or aneroid) or intracoronary microembolism, transmyocardial  DC shock, toxic cardiomyopathy from adriamycin, doxorubicin or catecholamines.  Overload models of HF may be induced by high pressure from aortic constriction,  aortic regurgitation, renal artery constriction, pulmonary stenosis or aortocaval  shunts, or by induction of mitral regurgitation from chordae or leaflet damage.  No single, all-encompassing, large animal model of HF exists to date. Selection  of the type of model to be used should be based primarily on the hypotheses to be  tested and secondarily on the available resources and facilities.","1999-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","395-402","","3","29","","Aust N Z J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 10868511","","","","Animals; Humans; *Disease Models, Animal; *Heart Failure/physiopathology/therapy; Cardiac Pacing, Artificial; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dog breed  potentially is 1 such factor. OBJECTIVE: To investigate breed variation in plasma  concentrations of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide 31-67 (proANP 31-67) and  N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 535  healthy, privately owned dogs of 9 breeds were examined at 5 centers as part of  the European Union (EU) LUPA project. METHODS: Absence of cardiovascular disease  or other clinically relevant organ-related or systemic disease was ensured by  thorough clinical investigation. Plasma concentrations of proANP 31-67 and  NT-proBNP were measured by commercially available ELISA assays. RESULTS: Overall  significant breed differences were found in proANP 31-67 (P < .0001) and  NT-proBNP (P < .0001) concentrations. Pair-wise comparisons between breeds  differed in approximately 50% of comparisons for proANP 31-67 as well as  NT-proBNP concentrations, both when including all centers and within each center.  Interquartile range was large for many breeds, especially for NT-proBNP. Among  included breeds, Labrador Retrievers and Newfoundlands had highest median  NT-proBNP concentrations with concentrations 3 times as high as those of  Dachshunds. German Shepherds and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels had the highest  median proANP 31-67 concentrations, twice the median concentration in Doberman  Pinschers. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Considerable interbreed variation  in plasma NP concentrations was found in healthy dogs. Intrabreed variation was  large in several breeds, especially for NT-proBNP. Additional studies are needed  to establish breed-specific reference ranges.","2014-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","451-457","","2","28","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24495256  PMCID: PMC4857989","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Canine; Plasma; Dogs/*blood/physiology; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary; Interbreed variation; Intrabreed variation; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/blood; Natriuretic Peptides/*blood; NT-proBNP; Peptide Fragments/blood; proANP 31-67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coagulation data of 32 patients were evaluated for mortality or  thromboembolism risk factors. Cocker Spaniels were at increased risk for IMHA (P  = .012). Timing of vaccination was not associated with development of IMHA. PCV  ranged from 5 to 33%, with a mean of 16 +/- 5%. Autoagglutination was present in  42% of the dogs.

CASE REPORT: An 18-week-old male entire Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel-Poodle was referred following 3 days of neurologic abnormalities after  cardiopulmonary arrest. After resuscitation, the animal had decerebrate rigidity,  a stuporous mentation and intermittent episodes of vocalisation and apnoea. A  brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken 4 days after  cardiopulmonary arrest, with standard sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and  fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) as well as diffusion-weighted imaging to  better discern ischaemic injury and cytotoxic oedema for prognostic reasons. MRI  findings were consistent with global brain ischaemia affecting the hippocampus,  cerebellum and substantia nigra, the latter two not previously identified in  canine cases of global brain ischaemia. The patient was euthanased on day eight  post-cardiopulmonary arrest due to a lack of neurological improvement and  developing sepsis as a complication. Ante-mortem identification of affected areas  of the brain was confirmed on histological examination, with evidence of  ischaemic injury seen in the cerebrum, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal nuclei and  thalamus. CONCLUSION: This report describes ante-mortem MRI and postmortem  findings in a dog with global brain ischaemia following cardiopulmonary arrest. A  multimodal approach to neuroprognostication in patients recovering from  cardiopulmonary arrest is recommended.","2022-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","433-439","","9","100","","Aust Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

The canine P2RX7 gene, coding the ATP-gated P2X7 receptor ion channel,  contains four known missense variants. The current study aimed to examine the  presence of these variants in a random sample of pedigree and mixed-pedigree  dogs. Exons 3, 8, 11 and 13 of the P2RX7 gene, encoding these four respective  variants, in 65 dogs were assessed by Sanger sequencing and combined with  existing sequencing data from another 69 dogs. The distribution of these variants  was then evaluated in all 134 dogs combined and separately within individual  breeds including 35 different pure breeds. The rs23314713 (p.Phe103Leu) and  rs23315462 (p.Pro452Ser) variants were present in 47 and 40% of all dogs studied  respectively, with the rs23314713 variant associated with brachycephalic breeds.  Among pedigree dogs, the rs23314713 and rs23315462 variants were associated with  brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic breeds respectively. The rs851148233  (p.Arg270Cys) and rs850760787 (p.Arg365Gln) variants were present only in dogs of  Cocker Spaniel and Labrador Retriever pedigrees respectively. No other missense  variants were found in exons 3, 8, 11 and 13 of the P2RX7 gene within the dogs.  In conclusion, the rs23314713 and rs23315462 missense variants of the P2RX7 gene  are present in a large proportion of dogs, with the rs23314713 variant associated  with a number of brachycephalic breeds.

Canine medical records from a veterinary teaching hospital and private referral  practice over a 17-year period were reviewed for a diagnosis of eosinophilic oral  disease. Twenty-four dogs with 26 lesions met the inclusion criteria. Patient  mean age and body weight were 6.8 (3.8) years and 13.4 kg, respectively. Fifteen  breeds were represented including Cavalier King Charles spaniel (16.7%), Labrador  retriever (12.5%), and West Highland white terrier (12.5%). Eosinophilic lesions  were found in the palate (65.4%), tongue (26.9%), and other oral locations  (7.7%). Median follow-up time was 5 months. Analysis revealed statistically  significant associations between lesion location and body weight (palatal and  tongue lesions were more likely in smaller dogs, whereas lesions in the other  category [lip or mucosa] were more likely in larger dogs). There was a  correlation in lesion location and resolution (all dogs with palatal lesions  became asymptomatic at their last recheck), and resolution and the use of  antibiotics plus prednisone (greater likelihood of resolution without the use of  this combination). Seventy percent of asymptomatic dogs resolved without  medication or with allergen therapy alone, suggesting that asymptomatic dogs may  respond well to conservative management. No associations were found between  lesion location and breed, signalment and response to therapy, lesion resolution  and the use of glucocorticoids, or significance of peripheral eosinophilia.","2019-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","25-31","","1","36","","J Vet Dent","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31138045","","","","Animals; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Risk Factors; canine; dog; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy; Dogs/genetics; eosinophilic disease; eosinophilic granuloma; eosinophilic granuloma complex; Eosinophilic Granuloma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary; eosinophilic palatitis; eosinophilic stomatitis; Mouth Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary; New Jersey; oral; Pennsylvania; veterinary dentistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An English Cocker Spaniel dog with the history of urinary tract infection was  physically examined and laboratory findings identified chronic renal  insufficiency and urinary tract infection. Attempts to culture organisms from  pyuric urine failed, and empirical antibiotic therapy did not resolve the pyuria.  A mycoplasma species most closely resembling Ureaplasma canigenitalium was  identified in urine samples by conventional PCR and sequencing. A quantitative  PCR method was developed to monitor and finally verify successful treatment. This  novel approach to monitoring mycoplasma urinary tract infections is conceptually  simple, and provides rapid results. It may have wider application in monitoring  treatment efficacy for infections with other Mycoplasma spp. as well as  additional organisms that are difficult to culture.

Multiplex screening of  such variants is now technologically feasible, but its practical potential as a  supportive tool for canine breeding, disease diagnostics, pet care, and genetics  research is still unexplored. RESULTS: To demonstrate the utility of  comprehensive genetic panel screening, we tested nearly 7000 dogs representing  around 230 breeds for 93 disease-associated variants using a custom-designed  genotyping microarray (the MyDogDNA® panel test). In addition to known breed  disease-associated mutations, we discovered 15 risk variants in a total of 34  breeds in which their presence was previously undocumented. We followed up on  seven of these genetic findings to demonstrate their clinical relevance. We  report additional breeds harboring variants causing factor VII deficiency,  hyperuricosuria, lens luxation, von Willebrand's disease, multifocal retinopathy,  multidrug resistance, and rod-cone dysplasia. Moreover, we provide plausible  molecular explanations for chondrodysplasia in the Chinook, cerebellar ataxia in  the Norrbottenspitz, and familiar nephropathy in the Welsh Springer Spaniel.  CONCLUSIONS: These practical examples illustrate how genetic panel screening  represents a comprehensive, efficient and powerful diagnostic and research  discovery tool with a range of applications in veterinary care, disease research,  and breeding. We conclude that several known disease alleles are more widespread  across different breeds than previously recognized. However, careful follow up  studies of any unexpected discoveries are essential to establish  genotype-phenotype correlations, as is readiness to provide genetic counseling on  their implications for the dog and its breed.","2016","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0161005","","8","11","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27525650  PMCID: PMC4985128","","","","Animals; Dogs; Species Specificity; Dog Diseases/*genetics; *Mutation; *Genetic Testing; Collagen Type IV/genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics; Dwarfism/genetics/veterinary; Factor VII/genetics; Genetic Counseling; Integrin alpha Chains/genetics; Uric Acid/urine; Urolithiasis/genetics/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 5 affected dogs tested, platelet counts and measurements of  plasma coagulant function and von Willebrand factor were normal. However,  bleeding times were prolonged in 4 of the 5 affected dogs tested, and platelet  aggregation in response to ADP and collagen was consistently abnormal in 3,  suggesting that the bleeding disorder was due to abnormal platelet function.  Measurements of 14C-serotonin uptake and retention by the affected platelets were  normal. However, their ADP content was decreased, while their ATP content was  normal, resulting in a mean ATP/ADP ratio of 8.32, compared to a mean ratio of  1.9 in normal canine platelets. Electron microscopy revealed that the number and  appearance of the dense granules in the affected platelets were indistinguishable  from those of normal controls. These studies suggest that this bleeding disorder  results from a deficient delta-granule storage pool of ADP; given the normal  serotonin uptake and retention by affected platelets and the apparently normal  number of dense granules, the ADP deficiency may be the consequence of a  selective defect in delta-granule ADP transport. Additional studies of this  unique platelet disorder will provide an opportunity to understand the mechanism  of adenine nucleotide storage in platelet delta-granules.","1995-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","949-953","","3","74","","Thromb Haemost","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8571327","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Platelet Aggregation/drug effects; Adenine Nucleotides/blood; Adenosine Diphosphate/*deficiency; Blood Platelets/metabolism/ultrastructure; Hemorrhage/genetics/physiopathology/*veterinary; Hemostasis/physiology; Platelet Storage Pool Deficiency/genetics/physiopathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to the best of  author's knowledge, there are no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis owing to  decreased tear production following removal of the NM gland. This case study  demonstrates the tear production changes in a dog for a year after removal of the  nictitating membrane (NM) due to suspicion of a malignant tumour. A 13-year-old  spayed female English Cocker Spaniel who had suffered from severe ocular  discharge, discomfort, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), and NM enlargement in  the right eye was brought to our hospital. The dog could not tolerate treatment  with topical 0.2% cyclosporine or corticosteroids. The dog's right eye had NM  gland prolapse, severe follicular conjunctivitis and a very low Schirmer tear  test-1 (STT-1) value of 3 mm/min. Furthermore, the result of fine needle  aspiration of the enlarged NM gland suggested a risk of malignancy. Despite the  risk of KCS, complete NM resection was performed to diagnose the tumour.  Fortunately, the final histopathological evaluation revealed chronic inflammation  without any evidence of malignancy. Contrary to concerns that the STT-1 value  would further decrease after the removal of the NM gland, the STT-1 value  remained elevated compared to that before surgery, and the clinical symptoms  improved for a year. It is generally known that NM gland resection is not  recommended due to the risk of developing iatrogenic KCS unless a malignant  tumour is suspected. In this case, surgical removal of the inflammatory NM gland  that was not responsive to medications had a positive effect on KCS. Since the  inflammatory and structural disease of the NM was strengthening KCS, the outcome  was thought to be different from that when the normal third eyelid was removed.","2022-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2268-2272","","6","8","","Vet Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

Aural polyps with ciliated epithelium are common in cats  but are rarely reported in dogs. In a previous case, a mass filled the tympanic  cavity alone, and it was surgically removed. OBJECTIVES: To report a case of a  canine aural polyp with ciliated epithelium extending from the dorsal tympanic  cavity to the external auditory canal with detailed otological features and to  demonstrate the usefulness of the transcanal endoscopic procedure (TEP) with a  diode laser as a less-invasive therapy. METHODS: A 12-year-old castrated male  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with a 6-month history of unilateral  chronic otorrhoea. Video-otoscope examination revealed a protruding, reddish and  soft-to-rubbery round mass in the right horizontal ear canal. Computed tomography  and magnetic resonance imaging further revealed a smooth mass extending from the  dorsal portion of the tympanic cavity into the horizontal part of the external  auditory canal. However, it showed no lesions in the dorsal tympanic cavity.  RESULTS: The mass was removed using aural forceps by a traction-torsion  manoeuvre. The suspected base of the mass on the caudal side of the upper  tympanic cavity was confirmed by a rigid scope, and it was completely vaporised  with a diode laser. Histopathology revealed foci of columnar ciliated epithelium  embedded in the connective tissue encapsulated by stratified squamous epithelium.  No recurrence was observed at 3 years and 8 months. CONCLUSION: We describe a  rare case of an aural polyp with ciliated epithelium extending from the  upper-middle ear to the external auditory canal in a dog. The TEP using a diode  laser may be a useful minimally invasive treatment option for managing external  auditory canal polyps.","2022-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1862-1866","","5","8","","Vet Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown that  self-monitoring and sense of agency (SoA, i.e., the ability to recognize one's  own actions correctly) are altered in schizophrenia patients. However, research  findings are inconclusive in regards to how SoA alterations are linked to  clinical symptoms and their severity, or cognitive factors. Methods: In a  longitudinal study, we examined 161 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 154  controls with a continuous-report SoA task and a control task testing general  cognitive/sensorimotor processes. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: In comparison to controls,  patients performed worse in terms of recognition of self-produced movements even  when controlling for confounding factors. Patients' SoA score correlated with the  severity of PANSS-derived ""Disorganized"" symptoms and with a priori defined  symptoms related to self-disturbances. In the follow-up, the changes in the two  subscales were significantly associated with the change in SoA performance.  Conclusion: We corroborated previous findings of altered SoA already in the early  stage of schizophrenia. Decreased ability to recognize self-produced actions was  associated with the severity of symptoms in two complementary domains:  self-disturbances and disorganization. While the involvement of the former might  indicate impairment in self-monitoring, the latter suggests the role of higher  cognitive processes such as information updating or cognitive flexibility. The  SoA alterations in schizophrenia are associated, at least partially, with the  intensity of respective symptoms in a state-dependent manner.","2020","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","570570","","","11","","Front Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Kozáková, Bakštein, Havlíček, Bečev, Knytl, Zaytseva and Španiel.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 33391045  PMCID: PMC7775529","","","","schizophrenia; follow-up; positive and negative symptoms; self-disturbances; sense of agency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diagnostic cytology is a useful technique and is usually used to establish a  definitive diagnosis of some tumors in veterinary medicine. This report describes  an extremely rare case of a deep dermal and subcutaneous canine hemangiosarcoma  in the perianal area. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old intact male spaniel was  presented for evaluation of a 4 × 4 cm, ulcerated, and hemorrhagic mass presented  in the right perianal region. In cytologic evaluation, malignant mesenchymal  tumor with inflammation was diagnosed, and incidental heart worm microfilaremia  was identified. Based on the cytologic evaluation, a punch biopsy (3 mm, three  sites) was conducted under anesthesia and deep dermal and subcutaneous  hemangiosarcoma (3 mitotic figures/10 high power field (400×)) was diagnosed by  histopathological evaluation. It was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry  results for cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and factor VIII-related antigen  marker. CONCLUSIONS: Deep dermal and subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma in the perianal  region is a rare condition, and its prognosis is usually poor. Perianal gland  adenoma and anal sac adenocarcinoma are the two most common tumors in the  perianal region, but other different types of tumors may also occur as in this  case; therefore, accurate diagnosis is required using cytology and/or  histopathological examination.","2019-04-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","115","","1","15","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30987633  PMCID: PMC6466795","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology; Dog; Skin/pathology; Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary; Anal Canal; CD31; Diagnostic cytology; Factor VIII-related antigen; Hemangiosarcoma; Hemangiosarcoma/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary; Perianal mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, no studies have been conducted to evaluate  potential relationships between these serum biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of  this study was to evaluate the relationship between HCY and MMA, 2  cobalamin-dependent metabolites, and both serum albumin and cα1 -PI  concentrations in hypocobalaminemic dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from 285 dogs  including 7 different breeds (Beagle, Boxer, Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd,  Labrador Retriever, Chinese Shar-Pei, and Yorkshire Terrier) with  hypocobalaminemia were used. Serum HCY, MMA, albumin, and cα1 -PI concentrations  were determined. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between serum HCY  and albumin concentrations, as well as serum HCY and cα1 -PI concentrations  (ρ = 0.62 and ρ = 0.37, respectively; P < .0001). No correlations were observed  between serum MMA and albumin concentrations, or cα1 -PI concentrations (ρ = 0.01  and ρ = 0.08, respectively; P > .05). In addition, significant breed-specific  correlations were observed between serum MMA and albumin concentrations in German  Shepherds, and serum HCY and MMA concentrations in Chinese Shar-Peis with  hypocobalaminemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a correlation between serum  albumin and cα1 -PI and HCY concentrations, but not with serum MMA concentration  in dogs with hypocobalaminemia. In addition, significant breed-specific  correlations were observed between serum MMA and albumin concentrations in German  Shepherds, as well as serum HCY and MMA concentrations in Chinese Shar-Peis,  emphasizing the unique metabolic interactions in those dog breeds affected by  hypocobalaminemia.","2014-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","561-566","","4","43","","Vet Clin Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25331651","","","","Animals; Breeding; Female; Male; Species Specificity; Biomarkers/blood; Dog Diseases/*blood/metabolism; Dogs/blood; alpha-Macroglobulins/*analysis; Antitrypsin; homocysteine; Homocysteine/*blood; methylmalonic acid; Methylmalonic Acid/*blood; Serum Albumin/*analysis; Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/blood/metabolism/*veterinary; vitamin B12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the third eyelids from both  eyes were everted, lobulated masses were present on the bulbar surface. The left  third eyelid had a larger protrusion. There was no apparent associated ocular or  systemic involvement. The tumor of left third eyelid was removed and referred for  histological examination. Histologically, there were proliferations of lymphoid  follicles surrounded by lymphoid cells forming a marginal zone. Those lymphoid  cells occasionally infiltrated into conjunctival epithelium. A few apoptotic  bodies with karyopyknotic and karyorrhexic nuclei were observed in the germinal  center of lymphoid follicles. Mitotic figures were rare. On immunohistochemistry,  tumor cells expressed CD79a but not CD3. A diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone  B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the third eyelid  was established based on the histological and immunophenotypical features. At the  1-year follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence of the mass at the area of  excision of the left third eyelid and the remaining tumor of the right third  eyelid was still a similar size.

DESIGN:  Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 124 dogs. PROCEDURES: Data were gathered from  ECGs, veterinarian questionnaires, echocardiograms, and radiographs submitted for  review; compared with data from a large control group; and examined for  association between variables and duration of survival. A new classification  system for AVB was evaluated. RESULTS: Afghan, Catahoula Leopard Dog, Chow Chow,  Cocker Spaniel, German Wirehaired Pointer, and Labrador Retriever breeds were  predisposed to high-grade second- or third-degree AVB. Heavier, older, and  sexually intact female dogs were overrepresented in the study group. Weakness,  lethargy, exercise intolerance, and syncope were the most common clinical signs.  The presence of clinical signs was not associated with duration of survival. Dogs  with high-grade second-degree AVB had a duration of survival similar to that of  dogs with third-degree AVB. Dogs with high-grade second- or third-degree AVB were  at high risk for sudden death in the first 6 months after diagnosis. High  ventricular escape rhythm rate and narrow escape-complex QRS width were  negatively associated with duration of survival. Pacemaker implantation had a  significant positive association with survival. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL  RELEVANCE: Pacemaker implantation should be strongly considered in all dogs with  high-grade second- or third-degree AVB regardless of whether clinical signs are  evident. If medical treatment is warranted, vagolytic medications may be the best  choice. A new classification system for AVB may merit further investigation.","2006-06-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1710-1717","","11","228","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16740072","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Male; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Age Factors; Pacemaker, Artificial/*veterinary; Prognosis; Body Weight/physiology; Electrocardiography/methods/veterinary; Survival Analysis; Death, Sudden/etiology/veterinary; Dog Diseases/classification/mortality/*pathology; Heart Block/classification/mortality/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing evidence indicates that CM and SM also occur in other small and toy  breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas. OBJECTIVES: To describe the presence of SM and  craniocervical junction (CCJ) abnormalities in Chihuahuas and to evaluate the  possible association of CCJ abnormalities with SM. To describe CM/SM-related  clinical signs and neurologic deficits and to investigate the association of  CM/SM-related clinical signs with signalment, SM, or CCJ abnormalities. ANIMALS:  Fifty-three client-owned Chihuahuas. METHODS: Prospective study. Questionnaire  analyses and physical and neurologic examinations were obtained before magnetic  resonance and computed tomography imaging. Images were evaluated for the presence  of SM, CM, and atlantooccipital overlapping. Additionally, medullary kinking,  dorsal spinal cord compression, and their sum indices were calculated. RESULTS:  Scratching was the most common CM/SM-related clinical sign and decreased postural  reaction the most common neurologic deficit in 73 and 87% of dogs, respectively.  Chiari-like malformation and SM were present in 100 and 38% of dogs,  respectively. Syringomyelia was associated with the presence of CM/SM-related  clinical signs (P = 0.034), and medullary kinking and sum indices were higher in  dogs with clinical signs (P = 0.016 and P = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND  CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Syringomyelia and CCJ abnormalities are prevalent in  Chihuahuas. Syringomyelia was an important factor for the presence of  CM/SM-related clinical signs, but many dogs suffered from similar clinical signs  without being affected by SM, highlighting the clinical importance of CCJ  abnormalities in Chihuahuas.","2017-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1771-1781","","6","31","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

STUDY DESIGN: Historical  cohort with a nested case-control study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Nine hundred and  fifty-three dogs diagnosed with CCL disease from 171,522 dogs attending 97  primary-care practices in England. METHODS: Medical records of dogs attending  practices participating in the VetCompass project that met selection criteria  were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used  to evaluate association of possible risk factors with diagnosis of CCL disease.  RESULTS: The prevalence of CCL disease diagnosis was estimated at 0.56% (95%  confidence interval 0.52-0.59). Compared with crossbred dogs, Rottweilers, West  Highland White Terriers, Golden Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, and Staffordshire  Bull Terriers showed increased odds of CCL disease diagnosis while Cocker  Spaniels showed reduced odds. Increasing bodyweight within breeds was associated  with increased odds of diagnosis. Dogs aged over 3 years had increased odds of  diagnosis compared with dogs aged less than 3 years. Neutered females had 2.1  times the odds of diagnosis compared with entire females. Insured dogs had 4  times the odds of diagnosis compared with uninsured dogs.

ANIMALS: 11  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with advanced MR attributable to chronic valvular  disease. PROCEDURE: Dogs were subjected to repeated examinations at 6-month  intervals until signs of decompensation had developed (end point). Data acquired  at end point were compared with data obtained from examinations 1 year and 1 to 6  months before decompensation. Each examination included physical examination,  collection of venous blood, thoracic radiography, and echocardiography. RESULTS:  Echocardiographic measurements of left atrial-to-aortic root ratio and left  ventricular end diastolic diameter increased considerably during the study,  whereas left ventricular end systolic diameter remained unchanged. The increase  in cardiac size was associated with increased plasma concentration of NT-proANP.  In contrast, plasma concentrations of aldosterone and angiotensin II were reduced  at decompensation (aldosterone compared with the 2 earlier examinations and  angiotensin II compared with values obtained 1 to 6 months before), despite  decreased plasma protein concentration and hematocrit, suggesting fluid  retention. The urine-to-plasma creatinine ratio was reduced at end point.  CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Early decompensated MR in dogs was not  associated with increased circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  activity, which may be caused by increased activity of ANP, and may be important  for future therapeutic strategies of MR.","1997-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","77-82","","1","58","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8989501","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Echocardiography/methods/veterinary; Aldosterone/blood; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/blood/physiopathology/*veterinary; Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology; Blood Pressure/physiology; Dog Diseases/*blood/*physiopathology; Angiotensin II/blood; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*blood/physiology; Creatinine/blood/urine; Heart Failure/blood/physiopathology/veterinary; Hematocrit; Radiography, Thoracic/methods/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: A nested case-control  study within UK primary care veterinary electronic patient record surveillance  programme, VetCompass, including over 300 UK veterinary practices. ANIMALS: A  total of 157,318 dogs undergoing GA/sedative events. METHODS: Cases included dogs  undergoing GA/sedative events between January 2010 and December 2013 with  GA/sedative-related death recorded within 48 hours or 2 weeks of the event.  Controls were randomly selected from dogs undergoing GA/sedation that did not die  within these time periods. Risks of GA/sedative-related death for all surgeries  and neuter-specific surgeries were estimated. Demographic and clinical  associations with GA/sedative-related death were reported as odds ratios  following multivariable logistic regression modelling. Statistical significance  was set at 5%. RESULTS: From 157,318 dogs with a GA/sedative event, there were  159 (0.10%) within 48 hours and 219 (0.14%) GA/sedative-related deaths within 2  weeks. Within 89,852 dogs that underwent a neuter surgery, there were eight  GA/sedative related (0.009%).

Ten CKCSs  with mild to severe untreated MR were treated with 2 ACE inhibitors, quinapril  and enalapril (each at 0.5 mg/kg PO q24h for 7 days), in a double-blind,  crossover study with a washout period of 7 days between treatments. Blood samples  were drawn and echocardiography was performed on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Both  treatments reduced ACE activity (P < .001) and increased renin activity (P <  .001) and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration (P < .005). The ACE inhibitors  had no effect on the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite (NOx) or asymmetric  dimethylarginine (ADMA). On day 0, a lower NOx concentration (P = .02) was found  in samples taken in the clinic as compared to samples taken in the homes of the  dogs. Quinapril caused a significant reduction in more variables that reflect the  severity of MR (eg, jet size and left ventricular end diastolic diameter) than  did enalapril. However, in terms of specific variables, no significant difference  was identified between the effects of the 2 treatments on MR. These results  suggest that ACE inhibitors do not affect NOx and ADMA concentrations in  asymptomatic dogs, but exercise, stress, or some combination may influence NOx  concentrations in these dogs.","2005-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","712-719","","5","19","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16231716","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Echocardiography/veterinary; Double-Blind Method; Arginine/analogs & derivatives/blood; Cross-Over Studies; Nitric Oxide/blood; Renin/blood; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Dog Diseases/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology; Enalapril/*therapeutic use; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/blood/drug therapy/enzymology/*veterinary; Natriuretic Agents/blood; Quinapril; Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, using a broad metabolite fingerprinting  approach, lipids appear to dominate inter- and intra- breed discrimination. The  purpose here was to use Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-High  Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) to identify in more detail, inter-breed  signatures in plasma lipidomic profiles of home-based, client-owned dogs  maintained on different diets and fed according to their owners' feeding  regimens. METHODS: Nine dog breeds were recruited in this study (Beagle,  Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, Dachshund, Golden Retriever, Greyhound, German  Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Maltese: 7-12 dogs per breed). Metabolite  profiling on a MTBE lipid extract of fasted plasma was performed using  UHPLC-HRMS. RESULTS: Multivariate modelling and classification indicated that the  main source of lipidome variance was between the three breeds Chihuahua,  Dachshund and Greyhound and the other six breeds, however some intra-breed  variance was evident in Labrador Retrievers. Metabolites associated with dietary  intake impacted on breed-associated variance and following filtering of these  signals out of the data-set unique inter-breed lipidome differences for  Chihuahua, Golden Retriever and Greyhound were identified. CONCLUSION: By using a  phenotypically diverse home-based canine population, we were able to show that  high accurate mass lipidomics can enable identification of metabolites in the  first pass plasma profile, capturing distinct metabolomic variability associated  with genetic differences, despite environmental and dietary variability.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","15","","2","13","","Metabolomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28111530  PMCID: PMC5216087","","","","Metabolomics; Plasma; Accurate mass metabolomic profiling; Canine breeds; Lipidomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CLINICAL FINDINGS: On physical examination, mild splenomegaly and prominent  submandibular and popliteal lymph nodes were detected. Complete blood cell count  revealed a high WBC count, characterized by a moderate lymphocytosis with 62%  unclassified cells and severe thrombocytopenia with macroplatelets. On cytologic  evaluation, the unclassified cells were described as large, neoplastic lymphoid  cells containing a large nucleus with lacy chromatin and a large amount of blue  vacuolated cytoplasm containing sparse, very fine azurophilic granules. A  diagnosis of acute large granular lymphocytic leukemia of splenic origin was  made. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Following induction chemotherapy, the affected dog  underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with dog leukocyte  antigen-matched CD34+ cells harvested from a sibling of the same litter.  Chimerism analysis revealed full donor engraftment within 2 weeks after  transplantation that remained stable for at least 2 years, with the dog remaining  apparently healthy at home. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Acute leukemias in dogs are  rapidly fatal diseases. If an appropriate donor can be located, allogeneic  hematopoietic cell transplantation may offer a feasible treatment, although  peripheral blood CD34+ cell harvesting requires the availability of cell  separator machines and management of graft-versus-host disease with  immunosuppressive agents.","2015-05-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","994-997","","9","246","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25875671","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; Dog Diseases/*therapy; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*veterinary; Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/therapy/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the 3 months  since hospital discharge, the dog had been receiving 1.3 mg/kg prednisolone and  2.6 mg/kg ciclosporin, both administered orally twice daily. Physical examination  revealed hepatomegaly and multiple, purulent, crusting, erosive to ulcerative  lesions over different body areas. Onychorrhexis had occurred on one digit and  the underlying corium had blackened. There were two proliferative and one  plaque-like lesions in the mouth. Thick walled fungal hyphae were detected in  impression smears from all skin lesions and staining with periodic acid-Schiff's  stain confirmed the presence of multiple fungal hyphae and spores in all biopsies  examined. Fungal culture isolated a heavy, pure growth of an Alternaria sp. which  was identified as A. infectoria by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer 1  region of the rRNA gene. The animal's condition prevented detailed investigation  of the oral lesions. Withdrawal of the ciclosporin and reduction of the  prednisolone dosage resulted in spontaneous resolution of the skin lesions within  40 days. Further gradual decrements in the prednisolone dosage to zero were  carried out without recurrence of the immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. After  12 months, there has been no recurrence of either the skin lesions or the  anaemia.

Environmental and genetic factors are frequently incriminated both in humans and  dogs. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to study the geographic distribution of canine  NHL (CNHL) in France and to evaluate genetic and environmental influences.  ANIMALS: Six hundred and eight cases of CNHL, diagnosed throughout France over 1  year, were collected from 7 Veterinary Histopathologic Laboratories. METHODS:  Retrospective study. Breeds affected by lymphomas were compared with the national  population and associations between breed and immunophenotype were studied. The  distribution of CNHL and canine T-cell NHL per 100,000 dogs per department was  compared with the distribution of waste incinerators, polluted sites, and  radioactive waste. RESULTS: The breeds significantly overrepresented among  lymphoma cases were Boxer, Setter, and Cocker Spaniel (P < .001). There was a  significant association between Boxer and T-cell NHL (P < .001), and between  German Shepherd and Rottweiler and B-cell NHL (P < .01). The geographic  distribution of CNHL and canine T-cell NHL indicated significant heterogeneity.  Significant association between distributions of CNHL and waste incinerators  (rho= 0.25, P < .05), polluted sites (rho= 0.36, P < .001), and radioactive waste  (rho= 0.51, P < .001) was found. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Influence  of genetics in the development of CNHL was supported by the existence of an  association between breed and immunophenotype. Waste incinerators, polluted  sites, and radioactive waste could just be considered as risk indicators of CNHL,  but not as risk factors. Case-control studies around critical sites are necessary  to confirm the implication of those environmental factors in the development of  CNHL.","2009-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","301-310","","2","23","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19192140","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Risk Factors; Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/genetics; France/epidemiology; *Environment; Immunophenotyping; Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/*veterinary; Lymphoma, T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R.","Analysis of candidate susceptibility genes in canine diabetes.","The Journal of heredity","","0022-1503","10.1093/jhered/esm048","","Canine diabetes is a complex genetic disease of unknown aetiology. It affects 0.005-1.5% of the canine population and shows a clear breed predisposition with  the Samoyed being at high risk and the Boxer being at low risk of developing the  disease. Canine diabetes is considered to be a disease homologue for human type 1  diabetes (T1D). It results in insulin deficiency as a consequence of autoimmune  destruction of islet beta-cells in the pancreas and is believed to be mediated by  Th1 cytokines (IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL-2). A number of genes have been  associated with type 1 diabetes in humans, including the human leukocyte antigen  region, the insulin variable number tandem repeat, PTPN22, CTLA4, IL-4, and  IL-13. As yet, these genes have not been evaluated in canine diabetes. In this  study, 483 cases of canine diabetes and 869 controls of known breed were analyzed  for association with IFNgamma, IGF2, IL-10, IL-12beta, IL-6, insulin, PTPN22,  RANTES, IL-4, IL-1alpha and TNFalpha. Minor allele frequencies were determined  for these genes in each breed. These data were used for comparative analyses in a  case-control study, and clear associations with diabetes were identified in some  breeds with certain alleles of candidate genes. Some associations were with  increased susceptibility to the disease (IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-12beta, IL-6,  insulin, PTPN22, IL-4, and TNFalpha), whereas others were protective (IL-4,  PTPN22, IL-6, insulin, IGF2, TNFalpha). This study demonstrates that a number of  the candidate genes previously associated with human T1D also appear to be  associated with canine diabetes and identifies an IL-10 haplotype which is  associated with diabetes in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. This suggests that  canine diabetes is an excellent comparative and spontaneously occurring disease  model of human T1D.","2007","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","518-525","","5","98","","J Hered","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17611256","","","","Animals; Dogs; Humans; Species Specificity; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Genotype; *Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Base Sequence; *Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*genetics/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The affected dogs had abnormalities on MRI,  including a relative increase in gray matter and an abnormal signal intensity of  cerebral and cerebellar white matter observed on T2-weighted MRI. White matter  changes on MRI were similar to white matter abnormalities observed in a  15-month-old boy with GM1 gangliosidosis. The weight ratio of white to gray  matter from the frontal lobe was markedly reduced. Microscopic examination  revealed characteristic ballooned neurons which stained lightly with Luxol-fast  blue. The central cerebral and cerebellar folia white matter exhibited pallor and  gliosis, while the corpus callosum and fornix stained normally with Luxol-fast  blue. Axons appeared intact on Bodian staining. Ultrastructural studies revealed  fewer myelinated axons in affected puppies. Total gangliosides in gray matter  were elevated. Thin-layer chromatography demonstrated GM1 ganglioside as the  predominant ganglioside. The amount of cerebrosides and sulfatides was reduced in  the gray and white matter when compared to controls but the ratio in gray and  white matter remained unchanged. Immunostaining of neutral glycolipids disclosed  increased amounts of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 glycolipid in gray  matter.

In different species, excessive 5-HT has been linked to valvular  lesions, similar to those seen in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.  Previous studies suggest higher 5-HT in healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  (CKCSs), a breed highly affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease, compared to  other breeds. OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential interbreed variation in serum  5-HT in healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 483 healthy dogs of nine breeds aged 1-7 years.  METHODS: Dogs were examined at five European centers. Absence of cardiovascular,  organ-related, or systemic diseases was ensured by thorough clinical  investigations including echocardiography. Serum was frozen and later analyzed by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Median 5-HT concentration was  252.5 (interquartile range = 145.5-390.6) ng/mL. Overall breed difference was  found (p<0.0001), and 42% of pairwise breed comparisons were significant.  Univariate regression analysis showed association between serum 5-HT  concentration and breed, center of examination, storage time, and sex, with  higher 5-HT in females. In multiple regression analysis, the final model had an  adjusted R(2) of 0.27 with breed (p<0.0001), center (p<0.0001), and storage time  (p=0.014) remaining significant. Within centers, overall breed differences were  found at 3/5 centers (p≤0.028), and pairwise comparisons within those centers  showed breed differences in 42% of comparisons. Among the included breeds,  Newfoundlands, Belgian Shepherds and CKCSs had highest 5-HT concentrations.

HYPOTHESIS: A  diet formulated to contain a high content of both protein and fiber is more  satiating than diets that contain only high fiber or high protein. ANIMALS: Six  entire female adult dogs (2 Shetland Sheepdogs, 2 Brittany Spaniels, 2 Labrador  Retrievers) participated in the satiety studies; 105 adult female dogs of various  breeds and ages were used for the palatability studies. METHODS: Three diets  (high protein [103 g/1,000 kcal] high fiber [60 g/1,000 kcal] [HPHF]; high  protein [104 g/1,000 kcal] moderate fiber [35 g/1,000 kcal] [HP]; moderate  protein [86 g/1,000 kcal] high fiber [87 g/1,000 kcal] [HF]) were tested.  Voluntary food intake was measured in 5 sequential crossover studies, and  palatability was assessed with food preference tests.

Medium-term intake (food  ingested when offered 3 hours after first meal) was lower for both HPHF (27 +/-  22.2 kcal/kg(0.73)) and HF (41 +/- 6.8 kcal/kg(0.73)) than for HP (57 +/- 18.8  kcal/kg(0.73)) (P = .041). Voluntary food intake 3 hours after feeding a  restricted meal (25% daily maintenance energy requirements) was significantly  lower on the HPHF diet than on either the HP (-51%, P = .0051) or HF (-47%, P =  .014) diets. However, there was no significant difference between the energy  intake on the HP and HF diets (7%, P = .37). The HPHF and HP diets had equivalent  palatability, and both were more palatable than the HF diet (P < .001).  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The HPHF diet had a satiating effect as  evidenced by reduced voluntary intake compared with HP and HF diets, and has the  potential to lead to greater compliance in weight-loss programs.","2007-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1203-1208","","6","21","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18196727","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Animal Feed/*analysis; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Diet/*veterinary; Dietary Fiber/*pharmacology; Dietary Proteins/*pharmacology; Satiety Response/*drug effects; Weight Loss/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that the prevalence of incidental HIF in French Bulldogs  may be greater than that of other brachycephalic breeds. A retrospective,  observational, prevalence study was performed using CT examinations of French  bulldogs and other brachycephalic breed dogs presenting for an unrelated  condition. Two European College of Veterinary Diagnostic and Imaging-certified  radiologists reviewed the images of the humeral condyles of these dogs. A  classification system was devised to grade the findings. We considered a Score 1  to be normal, Score 2 to have centralised sclerosis, Score 3 to have a partial  fissure and Score 4 to have a complete fissure. A total of 228 elbows were  reviewed from 122 dogs. Of this population, 145 elbows were from French Bulldogs,  54 were from Pugs, and the remainder were from a mix of other brachycephalic  breeds. The prevalence of HIF (score 3 or 4) in elbows of the French bulldog, pug  and other breed groups was 6.9% (CI 2.8-11%), 5.6% (CI 0-11.7%), and 3.4% (CI  0-10.15%), respectively. At a dog level, the prevalence of HIF (score 3 or 4  present in at least one elbow) was found to be 11.8% (CI 4.6-19%) in French  Bulldogs, 11.1% (CI 0-22.9%) in Pugs, and 5.26% (CI 0-15%) in the other breed  group.

One functional mutation that leads to expression of a less functional form  of P-gp, ABCB1-1Δ, has been described in dogs. Individuals with this mutation can  have severe adverse reactions to common veterinary pharmaceuticals that are known  substrates of this pump. We investigated the detection of this mutation in  samples submitted to two Australian diagnostic laboratories. METHODS: A total of  4842 dogs across 27 breeds were tested for the ABCB1-1Δ mutation from buccal  swabs or EDTA blood using standard PCR, multiplex PCR, or genotyping chip.  Statistical analysis was applied to determine the proportions and odds ratios of  the ABCB1-1Δ mutation in herding breeds compared with non-herding breeds.  RESULTS: The ABCB1-1Δ mutation was detected in nine breeds. The most commonly  affected breeds were collies, Australian shepherds, white Swiss shepherds, and  Shetland sheepdogs. Of 32 dogs in 18 non-herding breeds tested, one cocker  spaniel and one labradoodle were positive for the mutation, both heterozygous.  CONCLUSION: The most frequently affected breeds for ABCB1-1Δ mutation are the  collie, Australian shepherd, white Swiss shepherd and Shetland sheepdog. As the  mutation is associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions to  commonly used pharmaceuticals, veterinarians need to be aware of the breeds at  most risk of carrying this mutation and consider testing these individuals prior  to administering these medications.","2020-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","79-83","","3","98","","Aust Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 Australian Veterinary Association.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31743433","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Australia; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Mutation; Gene Frequency; breed; mutation; ABCB1; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/veterinary; MDR1; veterinary oncology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a  combination of mutations in the RDS/Peripherin and the ROM1 genes leads to the  phenotype of retinitis pigmentosa in man we first performed mutation analysis to  screen these genes for disease causing mutations followed by the investigation of  a digenic inheritance in dogs. We cloned the RDS/Peripherin gene and investigated  the RDS/Peripherin and ROM1 genes for disease causing mutations in 13  gPRA-affected dog breeds including healthy animals, obligate gPRA carriers and  gPRA-affected dogs. We screened for mutations using single strand conformation  polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Sequence analysis revealed several sequence  variations. In the coding region of the RDS/Peripherin gene three nucleotide  exchanges were identified (A277C; C316T; G1255A), one of which leads to an amino  acid substitution (Ala339Thr). Various silent sequence variations were found in  the coding region of the ROM1 gene (A536G, G1006A, T1018C, T1111C, C1150T,  C1195T), as well as an amino acid substitution (G252T; Ala54Ser). By excluding  the respective gene as a cause for gPRA several sequence variations in the  intronic regions were investigated. None of these sequence variations  cosegregated with autosomal recessively (ar) transmitted gPRA in 11 breeds. The  candidate gene RDS/Peripherin obviously does not harbour the critical mutation  causing the autosomal recessive form of gPRA because diseased individuals show  heterozygous genotypes for sequence variations in the Miniature Poodle,  Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog, Cocker Spaniel, Chesapeake Bay Retriever,  Entlebucher Sennenhund, Sloughi, Yorkshire Terrier, Tibet Mastiff, Tibet Terrier  and Labrador Retriever breeds. In the following breeds the ROM1 gene was also  excluded indirectly for gPRA: Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog,  Sloughi, Collie, Tibet Terrier, Labrador Retriever and Saarloos/Wolfhound.  Digenic inheritance for gPRA is practically excluded for both these genes in four  breeds: Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Labrador Retriever and Saarloos/Wolfhound.","2000-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","223-227","","3","31","","Anim Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10895316","","","","Animals; Dogs; Species Specificity; Dog Diseases/*genetics; Amino Acid Substitution; Point Mutation; Base Sequence; DNA Primers/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Eye Proteins/*genetics; Cats; Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics; Genetic Variation; Retinal Degeneration/genetics/*veterinary; Cattle; Cloning, Molecular; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; *Membrane Glycoproteins; Intermediate Filament Proteins/*genetics; Membrane Proteins/*genetics; Peripherins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CASE SUMMARY: A 9-year-old intact male Field Spaniel  presented for acute onset abdominal pain following a possible syncopal episode.  Abdominal ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and computed tomography  (CT) revealed right-sided perirenal hemorrhage that extended into the peritoneum.  The dog was discharged following stabilization with analgesia, fluid therapy, and  tranexamic acid. One month later, the patient presented with identical clinical  signs. A CT scan at this stage revealed bilateral kidney infarcts with new  left-sided perirenal hemorrhage. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced  ultrasound were repeated and showed similar findings. Follow up with  four-dimensional CT angiography revealed bilateral renal arterial malformations,  likely causing spontaneous renal hemorrhage and secondary subcapsular hematomas ,  retroperitoneal and peritoneal hemorrhage. UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: This is  the first reported case of both bilateral renal arterial malformations and  bilateral spontaneous subcapsular and perirenal hemorrhage in the absence of  neoplasia, coagulopathy, or trauma in a dog. Advanced imaging modalities,  including selective angiography, were required to diagnose this condition  successfully. Arterial malformations should be considered as a differential  diagnosis in cases of hemoretroperitoneum. Nephrectomy due to perirenal  hemorrhage should be cautiously considered, especially in the absence of  angiography, because of the sequential bilateral nature of this case.  Conservative management in this case resulted in a good long-term outcome 10  months later.","2022-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","267-273","","2","32","","J Vet Emerg Crit Care (San Antonio)","","","","","","","","eng","© Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2022.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35080123","","","","Animals; Dogs; Male; canine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/veterinary; Ultrasonography; *Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Kidney Diseases/diagnostic imaging/etiology/veterinary; hemoperitoneum; Hemoperitoneum/complications/veterinary; Kidney/diagnostic imaging; perirenal hemorrhage; Wunderlich syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seasonality and risk factors for GSFB  occurrence were investigated using electronic health records from a sentinel  voluntary network of 245 veterinary practices in the United Kingdom between 17th  March 2014 and 18th September 2020. Clinical narrative text mining of 4,580,503  canine consultations produced a final case dataset of 1,037 consultations where  GSFBs had been recorded in individual dogs. Cases of GSFBs were recorded in all  months, with 940 (90.6 %) recorded between June and September. In particular, the  odds of GSFBs in July was almost 176 times more than that of January (Odds ratio,  OR, 175.6, 95 % Confidence interval, CI, 43.5-707.7, P < 0.001). Compared to the  retriever breed type, spaniel breed types were 7.7 times more likely to present  with a GSFB (CI 5.4-11.0, P < 0.001). Other significant risk factors associated  with recorded GSFBs for this population included being male (OR = 1.4, CI  1.2-1.6, P < 0.001), and geographical location. When compared to the South East  of England, risk was lowest in Wales (OR = 0.1, CI 0.0-0.3, P=<0.001), and  highest in the East of England (OR = 1.9, 1.2-2.9, P = 0.003), and overall risk  in urban areas was reduced (OR = 0.8, CI 0.7-1.0, P = 0.024). These observations  provide a number of areas for temporally targeted health campaigns at specific  types of dogs, to reduce the impact of GSFBs on canine welfare.","2021-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","105499","","","197","","Prev Vet Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Regularly exercised dogs (N = 12) were evaluated on  five separate occasions. The population consisted of eight males and four females  ranging in age from 8 to 23 months, which included six Labrador retrievers, three  German shepherds, and one each English springer spaniel, German wirehaired  pointer, and Dutch shepherd. The exercise period was up to 30 min with 5 min of  intermittent rest between the exercise bouts or until a designated trainer  determined that the dog appeared fatigued (e.g., curled tongue while panting,  seeking shade, or voluntary reluctance to retrieve). At the end of the exercise  period, pulse rate (PR), core temperature, blood lactate, and venous blood gas  were collected. The median outdoor temperature was 28.9°C (84°F) (IQR;  27.2-30°C/81-86°F) and median humidity was 47% (IQR; 40-57%). Median duration of  exercise was 27 min (IQR; 25-29). No dog showed signs of heat stress that  required medical intervention. The components used to measure stamina in this  study were total activity, post-exercise core body temperature (CBT), and  increase in CBT. When controlling for breed, total activity, as measured by  omnidirectional accelerometer device, could be predicted from a linear  combination of the independent variables: pre-exercise activity (p = 0.008),  post-exercise activity (p < 0.001), outdoor temperature (p = 0.005), reduction in  base excess in extracellular fluid compartment (BEecf) (p = 0.044), and decrease  in TCO(2) (p = 0.005). When controlling for breed and sex, increase in CBT could  be predicted from a linear combination of the independent variables: study day  (p = 0.005), increase in PR (p < 0.001), increase in lactate (p = 0.001),  reduction in BEecf (p = 0.031), increase in glucose (p = 0.044), increase in  hematocrit (p = 0.032), and increase in hemoglobin (p = 0.038). This study  suggests that the influence of outdoor temperature, pre- and post-exercise  activity, and the metabolic parameters are important components of stamina  associated with exertion.","2017","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","144","","","4","","Front Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 28955711  PMCID: PMC5600973","","","","blood gas; core body temperature; detection dogs; exercise; outdoor temperature; stamina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Truncating mutations in the DMD gene  cause loss of dystrophin and the classical DMD clinical syndrome. Spontaneous DMD  gene mutations and associated phenotypes occur in several other species. The mdx  mouse model and the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine model have  been used extensively to study DMD disease pathogenesis and show efficacy and  side effects of putative treatments. Certain DMD gene mutations in high-risk, the  so-called hot spot areas can be particularly helpful in modeling molecular  therapies. Identification of specific mutations has been greatly enhanced by new  genomic methods. Whole genome, next generation sequencing (WGS) has been recently  used to define DMD patient mutations, but has not been used in dystrophic dogs. A  dystrophin-deficient Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dog was evaluated at  the functional, histopathological, biochemical, and molecular level. The affected  dog's phenotype was compared to the previously reported canine  dystrophinopathies. WGS was then used to detect a 7 base pair deletion in DMD  exon 42 (c.6051-6057delTCTCAAT mRNA), predicting a frameshift in gene  transcription and truncation of dystrophin protein translation. The deletion was  confirmed with conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing.

METHODS:  Basic clinical details were reviewed retrospectively in 73 dogs. Presence of  laryngeal collapse and short-term outcomes after surgery were determined for 64  dogs with complete medical records. Long-term outcomes were reviewed for 46 dogs  by telephone survey between 19 and 77 months following surgery. RESULTS: Stenotic  nares were present in 31 dogs (42.5 per cent), elongated soft palate in 63 (86.3  per cent) and everted laryngeal saccules in 43 (58.9 per cent). The most common  breeds were the pug (19 dogs, 26 per cent), Cavalier King Charles spaniel (15  dogs, 20.5 per cent), British bulldog (14 dogs, 19.2 per cent) and Staffordshire  bull terrier (4 dogs, 5.5 per cent). Laryngeal collapse was present in 34 of 64  (53 per cent) dogs. No dogs died perioperatively and only one dog was euthanased  as a result of its respiratory disease three years after surgery. Telephone  interviews indicated that 26 dogs (56.5 per cent) were much improved after  surgery, 15 (32.6 per cent) had some improvement and 5 (10.9 per cent) showed no  improvement. Signs that persisted after surgery were snoring during sleep (34  dogs, 73.9 per cent), stertor/stridor while conscious (23 dogs, 50 per cent),  excessive panting (13 dogs, 28.3 per cent) and dyspnoea (10 dogs, 21.7 per cent).

Recent works report sexual dimorphism of neurons in  the hippocampal formation and specialization of hemispheres in rats. Our  experiments indicate for the first time functional lateralization of the  high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) system directly associated with a synthesis  of acetylcholine in the hippocampus of Wistar rats. The markedly increased HACU  activity was found in the left compared to the right hippocampus of adult male  but not female animals. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed a statistically  significant increase of Vmax in the left hippocampus of 14-day-old when compared  to 7-day-old males. It appears that laterality of HACU occurs during late  postnatal maturation, and its degree is markedly enhanced after puberty and  attenuated during aging. Quinolinic acid (QUIN), an endogenous agonist of  N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptors, was used in this study to evaluate  the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. It is known that elevated  levels of QUIN accompany viral infections, increasing the risk of developing  schizophrenia. Bilateral intracerebroventricular application of QUIN (250  nmoles/ventricle) to pups aged 12 days significantly impaired the cholinergic  hippocampal system of adolescent male and female rats and reversed lateralization  of male HACU. Morphological analysis indicated marked changes in brain lesion  sizes (extensive 24 h and moderate 38 days after the operation). Asymmetry of  lesions was observed in the majority of cases, but the left hemisphere was not  generally more vulnerable to QUIN effects than the right side. Moreover, no  lateral differences were found between lesioned hippocampi in the specific  binding of [3H]hemicholinium-3 (10%-15% loss of binding sites when compared to  sham-operated animals). In summary, our results indicate a symmetrical drop in  the number of choline carriers of lesioned male rats but a asymmetrical decrease  in the activity of remaing carriers, suggesting defects in processes of sexual  brain differentiation, leading under normal conditions to the higher activity of  carriers in the left hippocampus. The data demonstrate viral infection-mediated  alterations in normal patterns of brain asymmetry and are discussed in relation  to animal models of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.","2004-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","671-680","","4","29","","Neurochem Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15098928","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Rats; *Functional Laterality; *Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus/*physiopathology; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*physiopathology; Rats, Wistar; Receptors, Cholinergic/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A genome-wide screen, using mapped markers in our  pedigree of Sry-negative XX sex reversed dogs founded upon the American cocker  spaniel, identified five chromosomal regions in which the causative gene may be  located. The canine genome was used to identify the canine homologue of goat  Pisrt1 and so determine that canine and caprine Sry-negative XX sex reversal are  genetically heterogeneous. A second goal of our research is to determine the  molecular mechanism by which the mutation causes testis induction. Thus far, we  have reported gonadal Sry and Sox9 expression patterns in normal embryos, which  have temporal and spatial patterns similar to those reported in humans, sheep,  and pigs. Once gene mutations causing such inherited disorders are identified,  DNA tests will become a part of general veterinary practice, advancing both  diagnostic techniques and preventative medicine.","2006-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1655-1658","","6-7","66","","Theriogenology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16466782  PMCID: PMC1779942","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Dogs/genetics; Sex-Determining Region Y Protein/genetics; *Genomics; *Sex Determination Processes; Cats/*genetics; Disorders of Sex Development/genetics; Sex Chromosome Aberrations/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study objectives were to investigate agreement between taurine  concentrations measured in WB, heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma, determine  intraindividual variation in healthy dogs, and evaluate if time from feeding to  sampling impacts concentrations. ANIMALS: Ten English Cocker spaniels and 10 dogs  of various breeds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dogs were fasted 12 h prior to initial  blood sampling, and the blood was collected at five occasions over eight h. Food  was offered immediately after first and one h after fourth sampling time point.  RESULTS: Agreement between taurine concentrations in EDTA plasma and heparinized  plasma was good (mean difference 4.5 nmol/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI)  36.8-45.8 nmol/mL). Whole blood concentrations were systematically higher than  EDTA and heparin plasma concentrations (mean difference 132.7 nmol/mL, 95% CI  23.6-241.8 nmol/mL, and 127.6 nmol/mL, 95% CI 28.6-226.6 nmol/mL, respectively,  all P < 0.001). Intraindividual daily variations in taurine concentration were  seen in all additives, with largest variations in plasma (P < 0.001). Taurine  concentration in heparinized plasma was higher at first and fifth sampling time  points compared to the fourth (P = 0.014). DISCUSSION: Agreement was found  between taurine concentrations measured in different additives, with expected  higher concentration in WB than plasma. Taurine concentrations measured in  heparinized plasma varied with sampling time point. Intraindividual daily  variations were observed in all additives, but mainly in plasma samples.  CONCLUSION: Taurine concentrations in dogs with suspected deficiency should be  interpreted with caution.","2023-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","59-70","","","45","","J Vet Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The medical records of 121  consecutive client owned CKCS with CM and SM, confirmed by whole body magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), that underwent foramen magnum decompression (FMD) with  cranioplasty and durectomy with biopsy from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively  reviewed. Dural biopsies were submitted to a board-certified veterinary  pathologist for histopathologic interpretation. The chi-square test was used to  analyze associations between histologic findings and categorical variables. For  continuous measures, the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to compare  distributions across pathology categories. A result was considered statistically  significant at the p < 0.05 level of significance. The mean age, duration of  pre-surgical clinical signs, and pre-operative QOL (1-5 scale) were 44.27 months,  44.78 weeks, and 2.72, respectively. Syringomyelia was found in the cervical  region only in 39 of 121 (32.23%) of dogs, in the cervical and thoracic region  only in 17 of 121 (14.05%) of dogs, and in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar  region combined in 65 of 121 (53.72%) of dogs. Sixty-six of one hundred  twenty-one (54.55%) dural biopsy specimens had histopathology changes; fifty-five  (45.45%) did not. Forty-three of one hundred twenty-one (35.54%) dural biopsy  specimens had osseous metaplasia, 16 of 121 (13.22%) had evidence of fibrosis, 4  of 121 (3.31%) had arachnoid hyperplasia, and 3 of 121 (2.48%) had evidence of  mineralization. Most dogs with CM were found to have histopathologic changes in  the dura at the time of FMD cranioplasty was performed. These dural changes can  be observed in dogs experiencing clinical signs for a time period as short as 4  weeks prior to presentation. The histopathologic changes were not associated with  age, breed, duration of clinical signs, the location of syringomyelia or QOL. The  influence of histopathologic changes on long-term prognosis in dogs without dural  decompression is unknown since all dogs in this study had dural resection.","2022","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","954092","","","9","","Front Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Holdsworth, Marino, Loughin, Miller, Sackman, Lesser and O'Donnell.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36157194  PMCID: PMC9489847","","","","syringomyelia; Chiari-like malformation; dura histopathology; dural biopsy; foramen magnum decompression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Retrospective review of records that underwent CLCT to repair  deep ulcers or perforations between 2002 and 2018. Signalment, concurrent eye  disease, additional procedures, pathogenesis, medication, graft orientation,  follow-up, and CCSs were recorded. RESULTS: 418 eyes of 399 dogs were included.  Brachycephalics were most commonly affected, comprising 325/418 (77.75%) of the  eyes. The most commonly affected breeds were Pugs, Shih Tzus, Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels, and French Bulldogs, with 116/418 (27.75%), 64/418 (15.31%),  34/418 (8.13%), and 34/418 (8.13%) ulcerated eyes, respectively. Mean age at  surgery was 5.5 years (range 59 days-17.7 years), and median follow-up time was  100 days (range 3 days-7.64 years). The most common etiopathogenesis was  spontaneous ulceration in 205/418 eyes (49.04%) of which 191 (93.17%) occurred in  brachycephalics. Primary keratoconjunctivitis sicca affected 122/418 eyes  (29.19%) and injury 39/418 eyes (9.33%). Mean ulcer width was 3.5 mm (0.5-10 mm).  Success rate was 97.13% (406/418 eyes).

Pre-existing  perforation was found in 101/418 (24.16%) of the eyes and significantly increased  failure rate (P < .001). The median CCS was G3 (G0-G4), which was lower for Pugs  (G2). Graft orientation affected CCS, but did not reach statistical significance.  CONCLUSION: The high success rate and CCS for CLCT in dogs make it a good  technique to treat deep ulcers but a less desirable outcome is anticipated when  treating perforations and Pugs.","2021-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","48-58","","1","24","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33034144","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; canine; Dog Diseases/*surgery; Conjunctiva/surgery/transplantation; Cornea/surgery; corneal grafting; corneal reconstruction; corneal surgery; corneal transparency; Corneal Transplantation/methods/*veterinary; Corneal Ulcer/surgery/*veterinary; Limbus Corneae/surgery; Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures/methods/*veterinary; Postoperative Care/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: 3 anemic WHWT littermates and 1 unaffected littermate; 16 dogs  from the same kennel, including 4 unrelated, phenotypically normal dogs (control  dogs), and 12 for which PK activity was not known; 2 PK-deficient Basenjis; 2  PK-deficient Beagles; 4 unaffected English Springer Spaniels; and 1 mixed-breed  dog. PROCEDURES: cDNA was cloned and sequenced, and cDNA sequences were compared  with the published sequence for canine R-PK cDNA to identify the putative  disease-causing mutation. Genomic DNA spanning the affected region was cloned and  sequenced to verify the mutation. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction primers  were designed to amplify the section of the gene containing the mutation from DNA  in blood or buccal swab samples. Gel electrophoresis allowed assignment of  genotypes on the basis of allele separation. RESULTS: 4 single base polymorphisms  attributable to sequencing errors in the published sequence were identified,  along with a 6 base pair (bp) insertion in exon 10 that was recognized as a  putative disease-causing mutation. An identical insertion was found in genomic  DNA. Amplification of genomic DNA yielded a 117 bp product for genotypically  normal dogs and a 123 bp product for WHWT homozygous for PK deficiency.

This disease is associated with prolonged  hospitalization and mortality rates from 8%-50%. A 2-year-old, neutered male King  Charles Spaniel and an approximately 8-months-old female Mongrel dog presented to  Companion Animal Clinic with symptoms of muscle rigidity and generalized  stiffness. A tentative diagnosis of generalized tetanus was made in both dogs.  Treatment consisted of IV fluids, antibiotics (metronidazole), human tetanus  antitoxin, analgesics and supportive care. Muscle relaxation was provided by  midazolam. Acetylpromazine meleate was added to the treatment of the second dog  to better control excitability. Each dog received magnesium therapy on the 10th  and 3rd days, respectively; which was provided per os to the first dog and  constant rate infusion (4 mg/kg/h) to the second dog. The addition of magnesium  helped to increase muscle relaxation and increased the time interval between  acetylpromazine administration. On the tenth day, magnesium sulfate was  discontinued from the second dog and magnesium aspartate (12 mg/kg), twice a day,  per os was administered in both animals. Further muscle relaxation was noted in  both dogs with a substantial reduction of tetanus symptoms. Both dogs were  discharged from Intensive Care Unit on the 14th and 13th day respectively with  sole treatment of magnesium aspartate (12 mg/kg) orally, twice a day. Magnesium  aspartate was continued for 14 days and 12 days respectively. Both dogs had  progressive reduction of muscle rigidity and the first dog recovered completely.  The second dog presented again with muscle rigidity and increased spinal reflexes  after the discontinuation of magnesium aspartate, thus therapy with magnesium  aspartate was started again and symptoms subsided after the second oral dose of  magnesium. Therapy was continued for two more weeks during which muscle rigidity  subsided and then was stopped. At that time, tetanus symptoms did not relapse and  the dog was considered fully recovered. According to the findings of this case  series, magnesium therapy may provide further muscle relaxation during the  standard therapeutic protocol of tetanus in dogs. In addition, long term symptoms  of the disease were adequately managed with the administration of magnesium  aspartate, orally.","2021-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","100535","","","44","","Top Companion Anim Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

SERIES SUMMARY: Two cases are reviewed. In the first case,  septic shock with ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed in a 4-year-old neutered  female Great Dane that underwent jejunoileal resection and anastomosis for a  partial mesenteric torsion. The patient's tachyarrhythmias failed to respond to  lidocaine, and an esmolol infusion was used for heart rate control. The condition  of the dog improved and she was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization. The  second case was a 7-year-old neutered female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with  septic peritonitis. Following surgery for intestinal resection and anastomosis,  supraventricular tachycardia developed that was not responsive to volume  resuscitation and was treated with an esmolol infusion. The condition of the dog  improved and she was discharged after 6 days of hospitalization. Both patients  were doing well at the time of long-term follow-up. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION  PROVIDED: This case series highlights a novel method of managing dogs in septic  shock with persistent tachycardia based on recently published data in the human  literature. The use of esmolol may be considered in certain veterinary patients  with septic shock to improve persistent tachycardia not related to hypovolemia.","2019-05","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","326-330","","3","29","","J Vet Emerg Crit Care (San Antonio)","","","","","","","","eng","© Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2019.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31044499","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; canine; Dog Diseases/*drug therapy; Digestive System Surgical Procedures/veterinary; Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosage; anti-arrhythmic; beta blocker; cardiovascular; critical care; Drug Therapy, Combination/veterinary; norepinephrine; Norepinephrine/administration & dosage; Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/veterinary; Propanolamines/administration & dosage; Shock, Septic/complications/drug therapy/*veterinary; Tachycardia, Supraventricular/complications/drug therapy/*veterinary; Vasoconstrictor Agents/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbapenems are not authorized for use in EU or UK companion animals, and the  prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CRGNB) in this  population is unknown. METHODS: We investigated CRGNB isolated from animal  specimens received by one diagnostic laboratory from 34 UK veterinary practices  (September 2015-December 2016). Any Gram-negative isolates from clinical  specimens showing reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and/or  aminoglycosides and/or cephalosporins were investigated phenotypically and  genotypically for carbapenemases. A complete genome assembly (Illumina/Nanopore)  was generated for the single isolate identified to investigate the genetic  context for carbapenem resistance. RESULTS: One ST410 Escherichia coli isolate  [(CARB35); 1/191, 0.5%], cultured from a wound in a springer spaniel, harboured a  known carbapenem resistance gene (blaNDM-5). The gene was located in the  chromosome on an integrated 100 kb IncF plasmid, also harbouring other drug  resistance genes (mrx, sul1, ant1 and dfrA). The isolate also contained blaCMY-42  and blaTEM-190 on two separate plasmids (IncI1 and IncFII, respectively) that  showed homology with other publicly available plasmid sequences from Italy and  Myanmar. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the use of carbapenems in companion animals is  restricted, the concurrent presence of blaCMY-42 and other antimicrobial  resistance genes could lead to co-selection of carbapenemase genes in this  population. Further studies investigating the selection and flow of plasmids  carrying important resistance genes amongst humans and companion animals are  needed.","2019-05-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1207-1211","","5","74","","J Antimicrob Chemother","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study was to determine the  epidemiological characteristics of canine mammary tumors diagnosed during the  period 2002-2012. The study was based on a retrospective study consisting of  1,917 biopsies of intact dogs that presented mammary gland lesions. Biopsies were  sent to the Department of Pathology FMVZ-UNAM diagnostic service. The annual  incidence of mammary tumors was 16.8%: 47.7% (benign) and 47.5% (malignant). The  highest number of cases was epithelial, followed by mixed tumors. The most  commonly diagnosed tumors were tubular adenoma, papillary adenoma, tubular  carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, solid carcinoma, complex carcinoma and  carcinosarcoma. Pure breeds accounted for 80% of submissions, and the Poodle,  Cocker Spaniel and German Shepherd were consistently affected. Adult female dogs  (9 to 12 years old) were most frequently involved, followed by 5- to 8-year-old  females. Some association between breeds with histological types of malignant  tumors was observed, but no association was found between breeds and BN. Mammary  tumors in intact dogs had a high incidence. Benign and malignant tumors had  similar frequencies, with an increase in malignant tumors in the past four years  of the study. Epithelial tumors were more common, and the most affected were old  adult females, purebreds and small-sized dogs. Mammary tumors in dogs are an  important animal health problem that needs to be solved by improving veterinary  oncology services in Mexico.","2015","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0127381","","5","10","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25992997  PMCID: PMC4436381","","","","Animals; Retrospective Studies; Breeding; Female; Incidence; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology; Dogs/classification; Mammary Glands, Animal/*pathology; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology; Mexico/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A retrospective study of all dogs presented with cataracts to  veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America between 1964 and 2003 was  conducted to determine cataract prevalence. The different decades, breeds,  gender, and age at time of presentation with cataract were compared. The  prevalence of dogs presented with cataract varied by decade and ranged from 0.95%  (1964-73), 1.88% (1974-83), 2.42% (1994-2003), to 3.5% (1984-93). The total  number of dogs presented with cataracts over the 40-year period was 39,229. From  1964 to 2003 the prevalence of cataract formation in this patient population  increased by about 255%. Fifty-nine breeds of dogs were affected with cataracts  above the baseline prevalence of 1.61% seen in mixed-breed/hybrid dogs. The  breeds with the highest cataract prevalence included: Smooth Fox Terrier  (11.70%), Havanese (11.57%), Bichon Frise (11.45%), Boston Terrier (11.11%),  Miniature Poodle (10.79%), Silky Terrier (10.29%) and Toy Poodle (10.21%). The  breeds with the largest number of cataractous dogs during the entire four decades  were the Boston Terrier (11.11%), Miniature Poodle (10.79%), American Cocker  Spaniel (8.77%), Standard Poodle (7.00%), and Miniature Schnauzer (4.98%). Gender  ratios of cataractous dogs seemed to affect limited breeds. Age of presentation  with cataract diagnosis varied among several breeds. In the mixed-breed/hybrid  baseline population, cataract formation appeared to be age related with a higher  frequency of cataract formation in dogs after 4-7 years. Cataract formation is  one of the most prevalent eye diseases in the dog population, and in about 60  breeds of dogs the prevalence of cataract exceeds that of the baseline  mixed-breed/hybrid group. The prevalence of cataract is also influenced by age in  most purebred dogs and affects 16.80% of the 7-15+-year-old mixed-breed/hybrid  dog population.

For an IgG antibody response to occur, this would  require B cell presentation of insulin peptides by major histocompatibility  complex (MHC) class II molecules, encoded by dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) genes,  in order to receive T-cell help for class switching. DLA genes are highly  polymorphic in the dog population and vary from breed to breed. The aim of the  present study was to evaluate AIA reactivity in diabetic dogs of different breeds  and to investigate whether DLA genes influence AIA status. Indirect ELISA was  used to determine serological reactivity to insulin in diabetic dogs, treated  with either a porcine or bovine insulin preparation. DLA haplotypes for diabetic  dogs were determined by sequence-based typing of DLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 loci.  Significantly greater insulin reactivity was seen in treated diabetic dogs  (n=942) compared with non-diabetic dogs (n=100). Relatively few newly diagnosed  diabetic dogs (3/109) were found to be AIA positive, although this provides  evidence that insulin autoantibodies might be involved in the pathogenesis of the  disease in some cases. Of the diabetic dogs treated with a bovine insulin  preparation, 52.3% (182/348) were AIA positive, compared with 12.6% (75/594) of  dogs treated with a porcine insulin preparation, suggesting that bovine insulin  is more immunogenic. Breeds such as dachshund, Cairn terrier, miniature schnauzer  and Tibetan terrier were more likely to develop AIA, whereas cocker spaniels were  less likely to develop AIA, compared with crossbreed dogs. In diabetic dogs, DLA  haplotype DRB1*0015--DQA1*006--DQB1*023 was associated with being AIA positive,  whereas the haplotype DLA-DRB1*006--DQA1*005--DQB1*007 showed an association with  being AIA negative. These research findings suggest that DLA genes influence AIA  responses in treated diabetic dogs.","2015-10-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","130-138","","3-4","167","","Vet Immunol Immunopathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a  prospective, controlled investigation, six Brittany spaniels that were homozygous  for a genetically determined deficiency of C3 (C3 deficient, < 0.003% of normal  serum C3 levels) and six heterozygous littermates (controls, approximately 50% of  mean normal serum C3 level) were given 2 mg/kg of reconstituted Escherichia coli  026:B6 acetone powder as a source of endotoxin, intravenously. All animals were  given similar fluid and prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and had serial  hemodynamic variables obtained. After E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient  animals had higher peak levels of endotoxin and less of a rise in temperature  than controls (P < 0.05). During the first 4 h after E. coli endotoxin infusion,  C3-deficient animals had significantly greater decreases in mean central venous  pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure than controls (P < 0.02). During the  first 48 h after E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient animals had  significantly greater decreases in mean arterial pH, left ventricular ejection  fraction, and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and greater increases in  mean arterial lactate, arterial-alveolar O2 gradient, and transaminases  (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) than controls, (all P <  0.05). After E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient animals compared to  controls had significantly less of a decrease in mean C5 levels (P < 0.01), but  similar (P = NS) increases in circulating tumor necrosis factor levels,  bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils, and protein, and similar (P = NS) decreases  in blood leukocytes and platelets. Two of six C3-deficient animals and two of six  controls died. In summary, after intravenous infusion of E. coli endotoxin,  canines with C3 deficiency have decreased endotoxin clearance and worse E. coli  endotoxin-induced shock and organ damage. Thus, the third component of the  complement system plays a beneficial role in the host defense against E. coli  endotoxic shock.","1994-02-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","569-578","","2","179","","J Exp Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8294868  PMCID: PMC2191352","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Heart/physiopathology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Complement C3/deficiency/*immunology; Endotoxins/*immunology; Escherichia coli/*immunology; Hemodynamics; Kidney/physiopathology; Liver/physiopathology; Lung/physiopathology; Multiple Organ Failure/blood/*immunology; Shock, Septic/blood/*immunology; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans, an inverse relationship between  degree of heart failure (HF) and circulating IGF-1 concentrations has been found  in several studies. In dogs with HF, few studies have focused on IGF-1. We  examined circulating IGF-1 concentrations in dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR)  caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease. Study 1 included 88 Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) with a broad range of asymptomatic MR (median serum  IGF-1: 76.7 microg/L; 25-75 percentile, 59.8-104.9 microg/L). As expected,  standard body weight and percentage under- or overweight correlated directly with  IGF-1. MR (assessed in 4 different ways) did not correlate with IGF-1. In study  2, 28 dogs with severe MR and stable, treated congestive HF had similar serum  IGF-1 concentrations (median, 100.8 g/L; 25-75 percentile, 74.9-156.5 microg/L)  as 11 control dogs (79.6 microg/L; 25-75 percentile, 64.1-187.4 microg/L; P =  .84). In study 3, the plasma IGF-1 concentration of 15 untreated CKCSs with  severe MR was 16.4 +/- 24.2 microg/L lower (P = .02) at the examination when  decompensated HF had developed (80.8 +/- 30.9 microg/L) than at a visit 1-12  months earlier (97.2 +/- 39.8 microg/L), possibly in part due to an altered state  of nutrition. The studies document that circulating IGF-1 concentrations are not  altered before development of congestive HF in dogs with naturally occurring MR,  but decrease by approximately 20% with the development of untreated HE In treated  HF, circulating IGF-1 concentrations apparently return to within the reference  range.","2005-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","528-532","","4","19","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16095170","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*blood/drug therapy; Heart Failure/blood/drug therapy/etiology/veterinary; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism; Mitral Valve Insufficiency/blood/complications/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Protein oxidation is one of the mechanisms involved in lens  opacification and may be causally related to depleted or diminished endogenous  antioxidant defences. We evaluated the levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic  antioxidants in blood and aqueous humour of cataractous poodles in comparison to  noncataractous poodles. METHODS: We studied 35 cataractous poodles aged 2 to 11  years, 14 noncataractous poodles and 15 noncataractous mixed-breed dogs. The  activity of erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase,  glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD]) was  evaluated in 18 cataractous poodles and 14 noncataractous poodles. We evaluated  ascorbic acid levels in plasma of all animals and in aqueous humour of  cataractous poodles and mixed-breed dogs. The dogs were deprived of food for 12  hours before sampling. Blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein before  and during anesthesia. Aqueous humour samples were obtained just before the  anterior chamber was opened. RESULTS: The activity of superoxide dismutase, G6PD  and catalase was significantly higher in noncataractous poodles than in  cataractous poodles (p < or = 0.05). The activity of glutathione peroxidase was  lower in noncataractous poodles than in cataractous poodles, but not  significantly so. There was no difference in mean plasma ascorbic acid  concentration between cataractous poodles (21.3 microM [standard deviation (SD)  7.4 microM]), noncataractous poodles (21.6 microM [SD 7.4 microM]) and  non-cataractous mixed-breed dogs (25.8 microM [SD 7.5 microM]). Similarly, there  was no difference in mean aqueous humour ascorbic acid concentration between  cataractous poodles (191.7 microM [SD 62.0 microM] and noncataractous mixed-breed  dogs (215.7 microM [SD 91.8 microM]). INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that,  at least in the population studied here, no correlation exists between the onset  of cataract and ascorbic acid concentration in blood and aqueous humour. The  decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes may explain in part the onset of  cataract in poodles.","2004-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","19-24","","1","39","","Can J Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15040610","","","","Animals; Dogs; Dog Diseases/*enzymology; Antioxidants/metabolism; Aqueous Humor/*enzymology; Ascorbic Acid/*metabolism; Catalase/metabolism; Cataract Extraction; Cataract/enzymology/*veterinary; Erythrocyte Membrane/*enzymology; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism; Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism; Oxidative Stress; Oxidoreductases/*metabolism; Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we investigate the spinal cord  lesion relating to this phenomenon which has characteristics similar to fictive  scratch secondary to spinal cord transection. Medical records were searched for  Cavalier King Charles spaniels with a clinical and MRI diagnosis of symptomatic  SM associated with Chiari-like malformation (CM). The cohort was divided into SM  with phantom scratching (19 dogs) and SM but no phantom scratching (18 dogs). MRI  files were anonymised, randomised and viewed in EFILM ™. For each transverse  image, the maximum perpendicular dimensions of the syrinx in the dorsal spinal  cord quadrants were determined. Visual assessment was made as to whether the  syrinx extended to the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). RESULTS: We showed that  phantom scratching appears associated with a large dorsolateral syrinx that  extends to the SDH in the C3-C6 spinal cord segments (corresponding to C2-C5  vertebrae). Estimated dorsal quadrant syrinx sizes based on the perpendicular  diameters were between 2.5 and 9.5 times larger in dogs with phantom scratching,  with the largest mean difference p-value being 0.009. CONCLUSION: SM associated  phantom scratching appears associated with MRI findings of a large syrinx  extending into the mid cervical SDH. We hypothesise that damage in this region  might influence the lumbosacral scratching central pattern generator (CPG). If a  scratching SM affected dog does not have a large dorsolateral cervical syrinx  with SDH involvement then alternative explanations for scratching should be  investigated.","2017-11-16","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","340","","1","13","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29145838  PMCID: PMC5691609","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Chiari-like malformation; Syringomyelia/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Chiari malformation; Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Behavior, Animal; Alloknesis; Central pattern generator; Fictive scratch; Neuropathic itch; Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Spinal Cord/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Superficial dorsal horn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  cord1 locus was mapped using MLHDs from an inbred colony with a homogeneous early  onset disease phenotype. In this paper, the MLHD pet population was studied to  investigate phenotypic variation and genotype-phenotype correlation. Further, the  cord1 locus was fine-mapped using PRA cases from the MLHD pet population to  narrow the critical region. Other dog breeds were also screened for the RGPRIP1  insertion. METHODS: This study examined phenotypic variation in an MLHD pet  population that included 59 sporadic PRA cases and 18 members of an extended  family with shared environment and having six PRA cases. Ophthalmologic  evaluations included behavioral abnormalities, responses to menace and light,  fundoscopy, and electroretinography (ERG). The RPGRIP1 insertion was screened for  in all cases and 200 apparently normal control MLHDs and in 510 dogs from 66  other breed. To fine-map the cord1 locus in the MLHD, 74 PRA cases and 86  controls aged 4 years or more were genotyped for 24 polymorphic markers within  the previously mapped cord1 critical region of 14.15 Mb. RESULTS: Among sporadic  PRA cases from the MLHD pet population, the age of onset varied from 4 months to  15 years old; MLHDs from the extended family also showed variable onset and rate  of progression. Screening for the insertion in RPGRIP1 identified substantial  genotype-phenotype discordance: 16% of controls were homozygous for the insertion  (RPGRIP1(-/-)), while 20% of PRA cases were not homozygous for it. Four other  breeds were identified to carry the insertion including English Springer Spaniels  and Beagles with insertion homozygotes. The former breed included both controls  and PRA cases, yet in the latter breed, cone ERG was undetectable in two dogs  with no clinically apparent visual dysfunction. Notably, the insertion in the  Beagles was a longer variant of that seen in the other breeds. Fine-mapping of  the cord1 locus narrowed the critical region on CFA15 from 14.15 Mb to 1.74 Mb  which still contains the RPGRIP1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive phenotypic  variations of onset age and progression rate were observed in PRA cases of the  MLHD pet population. The insertion in RPGRIP1 showed the strongest association  with the disease, yet additional as well as alternative factors may account for  the substantial genotype-phenotype discordance.","2009-11-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2287-2305","","","15","","Mol Vis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19936303  PMCID: PMC2779058","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Pedigree; Case-Control Studies; Genotype; Dog Diseases/*genetics/pathology; Phenotype; Haplotypes/genetics; Age Distribution; Electroretinography; Animals, Domestic/genetics; Base Pairing/genetics; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Fundus Oculi; Genetic Loci/genetics; Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics; Mutation/*genetics; Physical Chromosome Mapping; Proteins/*genetics; Retinitis Pigmentosa/genetics/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to contribute to  the aetiopathogenesis of relative or absolute insulin deficiency, including  immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. DM risk varies considerably  between different dog breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved and  contribute susceptibility or protection. Associations of particular dog leucocyte  antigen (DLA) class II haplotypes with DM have been identified, but  investigations to date have only considered all breeds pooled together. The aim  of this study was to analyse an expanded data set so as to identify  breed-specific diabetes-associated DLA haplotypes. METHODS: The 12 most highly  represented breeds in the UK Canine Diabetes Register were selected for study.  DLA-typing data from 646 diabetic dogs and 912 breed-matched non-diabetic  controls were analysed to enable breed-specific analysis of the DLA. Dogs were  genotyped for allelic variation at DLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1 loci using DNA  sequence-based typing. Genotypes from all three loci were combined to reveal  three-locus DLA class II haplotypes, which were evaluated for statistical  associations with DM. This was performed for each breed individually and for all  breeds pooled together. RESULTS: Five dog breeds were identified as having one or  more DLA haplotype associated with DM susceptibility or protection. Four  DM-associated haplotypes were identified in the Cocker Spaniel breed, of which  one haplotype was shared with Border Terriers. In the three breeds known to be at  highest risk of DM included in the study (Samoyed, Tibetan Terrier and Cairn  Terrier), no DLA haplotypes were found to be associated with DM. CONCLUSIONS:  Novel DLA associations with DM in specific dog breeds provide further evidence  that immune response genes contribute susceptibility to this disease in some  cases. It is also apparent that DLA may not be contributing obvious or strong  risk for DM in some breeds, including the seven breeds analysed for which no  associations were identified.","2020-10-31","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","15","","1","7","","Canine Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33292601  PMCID: PMC7603736","","","","Canine; Genetics; Diabetes mellitus; Dog leucocyte antigen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to  pedigree genealogies, genomic data allow a deeper knowledge of the variability  and genetic structure of populations. To date, many dog breeds, such as small  regional breeds, still remain uncharacterized. Braque Français type Pyrénées  (BRA) is a dog breed originating from a very old type of gun-dog used for  pointing the location of game birds to hunters. Despite the ancient background,  the knowledge about levels of genetic diversity, degree of inbreeding and  population structure is scarce. This may raise concerns on the possibility that  few inbred bloodlines may dominate the breed, and on its future health. The aim  of this work was therefore to provide a high-resolution representation of the  genome-wide diversity and population structure of BRA dogs, using the 170K  genome-wide SNP array. Genome-wide polymorphisms in BRA were compared with those  of other worldwide dog breeds. Between-dog relationships estimated from genomic  data were very similar to pedigree relationships (Pearson correlation rg,a =  0.92). Results showed that BRA generally presents moderate levels of genetic  diversity when compared with the major canine breeds. The estimated effective  population size (recent Ne = 51) shows a similar declining pattern over  generations as all other dog breeds, pointing at a common demographic history of  modern canine breeds, clearly different from the demography of feral wolves.  Multidimensional scaling (MDS), Bayesian clustering and Neighbor Joining tree  were used to visualize and explore the genetic relationships among breeds, and  revealed that BRA was highly differentiated and presented only low levels of  admixture with other breeds. Brittany Spaniel, English Setter, Gordon Setter and  Weimaraner dogs are the closest breeds to BRA. The exact reason for BRA being so  divergent from other dog breeds, based on these results, is not yet clear.  Further studies including additional ≪braccoid≫ breeds will be needed to refine  the results presented here and to investigate the origin of the BRA breed.  Nonetheless, the genome-wide characterization reported here provides a  comprehensive insight into the genome diversity and population structure of the  Braque Français, type Pyrénées breed.","2018","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0208548","","12","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30517199  PMCID: PMC6281230","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; *Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; *Genome; Bayes Theorem; Linkage Disequilibrium; Population Density","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to characterise neurological signs in  relation to infarct topography in dogs with suspected cerebellar ischaemic stroke  and to report short-term outcome confined to the hospitalisation period. A  retrospective multicentre study of dogs with suspected cerebellar ischaemic  stroke examined from 2010-2015 at five veterinary referral hospitals was  performed. Findings from clinical, neurological, and paraclinical investigations  including magnetic resonance imaging were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-three dogs,  13 females and 10 males with a median age of 8 years and 8 months, were included  in the study. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (n = 9) was a commonly  represented breed. All ischaemic strokes were located to the vascular territory  of the rostral cerebellar artery including four extensive and 19 limited  occlusions. The most prominent neurological deficits were gait abnormalities  (ataxia with hypermetria n = 11, ataxia without hypermetria n = 4, non-ambulatory  n = 6), head tilt (n = 13), nystagmus (n = 8), decreased menace response (n = 7),  postural reaction deficits (n = 7), and proprioceptive deficits (n = 5).  Neurological signs appeared irrespective of the infarct being classified as  extensive or limited. All dogs survived and were discharged within 1-10 days of  hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Dogs affected by rostral cerebellar ischaemic  stroke typically present with a collection of neurological deficits characterised  by ataxia, head tilt, and nystagmus irrespective of the specific cerebellar  infarct topography. In dogs with peracute to acute onset of these neurological  deficits, cerebellar ischaemic stroke should be considered an important  differential diagnosis, and neuroimaging investigations are indicated. Although  dogs are often severely compromised at presentation, short-term prognosis is  excellent and rapid clinical improvement may be observed within the first week  following the ischaemic stroke.","2016-06-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","40","","1","58","","Acta Vet Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27267355  PMCID: PMC4897939","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Canine; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary; Diagnosis, Differential; Syndrome; Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Prognosis; Cerebellum/pathology; Occlusion; Ataxia/diagnostic imaging/veterinary; Cerebellum; Cerebrovascular accident; Infarct; Ischemic; Nervous System Diseases/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*veterinary; Rostral cerebellar artery; Stroke/complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Vestibular","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PROCEDURE:  Medical records were reviewed for 108 dogs (108 eyes) treated with intravitreal  gentamicin with or without dexamethasone sodium phosphate or triamcinolone for  glaucoma between 2013 and 2018 with 3 months of minimum follow-up. Signalment and  clinical findings, including type of glaucoma, pre-procedure intraocular pressure  (IOP), chronicity, procedure protocol, and outcome were recorded. Success was  defined as an intraocular pressure of ≤25 mm Hg at the time of last  re-examination or no ocular hypotensive medications at 3 months or longer  post-injection. RESULTS: The overall success rate for pharmacologic ablation was  95%. The success rate for dogs receiving no ocular hypotensive medications was  86%. Seventy-six eyes (70.4%) had primary glaucoma, and 32 eyes (29.6%) had  secondary glaucoma.

Dogs ranged in age from 1 to 13 years, with a mean age of  6.5 years. The 2 most commonly affected breeds were Cocker Spaniels and Labrador  Retrievers. Fifty-two of the 60 dogs tested (87%) were autoagglutination positive  and spherocytes were present in 45 (75%). Forty-one (89%) of 46 patients tested  positive for the presence of immunoglobulin on the red blood cell surface (Coombs  assay). The most common clinical signs at presentation were lethargy, weakness,  pale mucous membranes, icterus, hemoglobinuria, and anorexia. PCV less than 25%  was present in 59 (98%) dogs. At the time of presentation, 35 dogs (58%) had a  nonregenerative anemia, whereas 25 patients (42%) had a regenerative response.  Thrombocytopenia was seen in 41 (68%) dogs. Nine of 34 dogs (26%) had a prolonged  prothrombin time, 19 of 34 (56%) had a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin  clotting time, and 12 of 34 (35%) had abnormal fibrinogen concentrations. All  dogs received prednisone at immunosuppressive doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg PO as a single  or divided dose every 24 hours) and cyclophosphamide as primary therapy.  Forty-one dogs (63%) received cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/m2 q24h for 4 days,  whereas 9 dogs (15%) received an initial high dose (200 mg/m2) followed by 3 days  of a lower dose (50 mg/m2 q24h). No statistical difference in survival times was  found for either protocol. Thirteen dogs were treated with azathioprine in  addition to cyclophosphamide and prednisone. The median survival time of dogs  that received all 3 drugs was 370 days as compared to 9 days for those dogs that  were treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisone alone. Thirty-one (52%) dogs  died from the disease, 13 (22%) dogs were alive, and 15 (25%) dogs were lost to  follow-up. The median length of survival for all dogs was 21 days.

However, canine adrenocortical  carcinomas identified by 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) have not been  reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old, castrated male, Cocker Spaniel dog  with severe systolic hypertension exhibited an adrenal mass approximately 3.6 cm  in diameter on ultrasonography. There was no evidence of pulmonary metastasis or  vascular invasion on thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography,  respectively. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed to identify the characteristics of the  adrenal mass and the state of metastasis. One hour after injection of 5.46 MBq/kg  18F-FDG intravenously, the peripheral region of the adrenal mass visually  revealed an increased 18F-FDG uptake, which was higher than that of the liver,  and the central region of the mass exhibited necrosis. The maximal standardized  uptake value (SUV) of the adrenal mass was 3.24; and relative SUV, calculated by  dividing the maximal SUV of the adrenal tumor by the mean SUV of the normal  liver, was 5.23. Adrenocortical carcinoma was tentatively diagnosed and surgical  adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination of the resected adrenal  mass revealed the characteristics of an adrenocortical carcinoma. After  adrenalectomy, systolic blood pressure reduced to below 150 mmHg without any  medication. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of 18F-FDG PET/CT findings  in a dog with suspected adrenocortical carcinoma and may provide valuable  diagnostic information for adrenocortical carcinoma in dogs.","2022-01-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","15","","1","18","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

As clinical  signs are multiple and common to other diseases, its diagnosis can be  challenging. In particular, in areas where angiostrongylosis and dirofilariosis  overlap, a misleading diagnosis of cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis might occur  even on the basis of possible misleading outcomes from diagnostic kits. CASE  PRESENTATION: Two Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs from an Italian breeding in  the Northwest were referred to a private veterinary hospital with respiratory  signs. A cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis was diagnosed and the dogs treated with  ivermectin, but one of them died. At necropsy, pulmonary oedema, enlargement of  tracheo-bronchial lymphnodes and of cardiac right side were detected. Within the  right ventricle lumen, adults of A. vasorum were found. All dogs from the same  kennel were subjected to faecal examination by FLOTAC and Baermann's techniques  to detect A. vasorum first stage larvae; blood analysis by Knott's for  Dirofilaria immitis microfilariae, and antigenic tests for both A. vasorum (Angio  Detect™) and D.immitis (DiroCHEK® Heartworm, Witness®Dirofilaria). The surviving  dog with respiratory signs resulted positive for A. vasorum both at serum  antigens and larval detection. Its Witness® test was low positive similarly to  other four dogs from the same kennel, but false positive results due to cross  reactions with A. vasorum were also considered. No dogs were found infected by A.  vasorum. Eventually, the investigation was deepened by browsing the pathological  database of Veterinary Pathology Laboratories at Veterinary School of Milan  University through 1998-2016, where 11 cases of angiostrongylosis were described.  Two out of 11 dogs had a mixed infection with Crenosoma vulpis. CONCLUSION: The  study demonstrates the need for accurate surveys to acquire proper  epidemiological data on A. vasorum infection in Northwestern Italy and for  appropriate diagnostic methods. Veterinary clinicians should be warned about the  occurrence of this canine parasite and the connected risk of a misleading  diagnosis, particularly in areas endemic for cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis.","2017-06-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","165","","1","13","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28592295  PMCID: PMC5463301","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Diagnosis, Differential; Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*parasitology; *Angiostrongylus; Angio detect™; Angiostrongylus vasorum; Crenosoma vulpis; Diagnostic Errors/veterinary; DiroCHEK® heartworm; Dirofilaria immitis; Dirofilariasis/*diagnosis; FLOTAC; Heart Diseases/diagnosis/parasitology/*veterinary; Lung Diseases, Parasitic/diagnosis/*veterinary; Strongylida Infections/diagnosis/*veterinary; Witness® Dirofilaria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS:  Dogs (n = 12). METHODS: Medical records (2009-2011) of dogs that had nano-THR  were reviewed for signalment, weight, clinical signs, side, age, prosthesis  sizes, concurrent surgeries performed, complications, operative time, 3-month  postoperative pelvic radiograph results, and lameness scores. RESULTS: Breeds  were Yorkshire Terriers (n = 6), Toy Poodles (2), with 1 each of Maltese,  Pomeranian, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and Shih-Tzu. Median body was 4.87 kg  (range, 2.5-5.90 kg) and median age, 35.75 months (range, 12-144 months).  Radiographs were taken in 4 dogs at 12 days (n = 2), 14 days (1), and 30 days (1)  after surgery because of presentation for an acute grade 5 lameness. Three dogs  had femoral fractures distal to the femoral implant tip and 1 dog displaced the  acetabular implant medially. After revision surgery, all femoral fractures were  assessed as healed with intact plate fixation. The dog with the medially  displaced acetabular component responded to conservative management including  strict confinement and analgesic administration. Eight dogs (58%) were assigned a  grade 1 lameness and 4 dogs were grade 2 (33%) at 12-week examination. The 3 dogs  with grade 5 lameness scores found to have femoral fractures within 1 month after  surgery, subsequently improved to grade 1 (n = 1) and 2 (2) 12 weeks after  revision surgery. The dog with medial acetabular displacement improved to a grade  2 lameness 12 weeks after conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: Although all 12  dogs had good-to-excellent outcomes, 33% experienced significant complications  associated with the technique. As improvements in instrumentation and refinements  in the technique are developed, NanoTHR can be considered an alternative to the  femoral head and neck ostectomy (FHO) or medical management of coxofemoral  disease for toy breed dogs.

Human  muscle and liver contain homotetramers M4 and L4, respectively, whereas  erythrocytes contain a mixture of M4, M3L, M2L2, ML3, and L4 isozymes. Homozygous  deficiency of the M subunit in man results in glycogen storage disease (GSD) type  VII, which is characterized by exertional muscle weakness and compensated  hemolysis; the residual erythrocyte PFK consists of isolated L4 isozyme.  Recently, PFK deficiency associated with isolated hemolytic anemia has been  identified among English springer spaniel dogs. We investigated the genetic  control of the dog PFK system and the nature of the enzymatic defect in two  PFK-deficient animals, using chromatographic and immunological techniques. Our  studies indicate the existence of a trilocus isozyme system for the dog, as is  the case with other mammals. Muscle PFK consists of M4 isozyme, whereas the  predominant species of liver and platelet consists, respectively, of the L4 and  P4 isozyme; erythrocyte PFK consists of a three- or four-membered set composed of  M and P subunits. PFK deficiency in the dogs was found to result from a total and  universal lack of the M subunit, as is the case in man. However, the probands  consistently exhibited L4 isozyme in their muscle; P4, L4, and hybrids thereof in  their erythrocytes; and an increase in the L-containing isozymes in their  platelets, indicating a generalized anomalous presence of the L subunit. The  apparent absence of muscle disease in these animals is most likely accounted for  by both the well-known high oxidative potential of the canine muscle in general  and the presence of liver PFK in the M-deficient muscle in particular. In  contrast, presence of hemolysis despite residual P4 and hybrids of P and L in the  erythrocytes may be inferred to result in severe glycolytic handicap under  existing intraerythrocytic conditions.","1985-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","8109-8113","","23","82","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2933748  PMCID: PMC391452","","","","Animals; Dogs/*genetics; Erythrocytes/enzymology; Dog Diseases/*enzymology/genetics; Glycogen Storage Disease/enzymology/genetics/*veterinary; Glycogen/metabolism; Immunologic Techniques; Isoenzymes/genetics; Muscles/enzymology; Phosphofructokinase-1/*deficiency/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous clinical studies have observed serotonin (5HT)  dysregulation in cardiac valvulopathies; however, the impact of 5HT-mediated  signaling on MVIC activation and leaflet remodeling in MVP have been investigated  to a limited extent. Here we test the hypothesis that 5HT receptors (5HTRs)  signaling contributes to MVP pathophysiology. METHODS AND RESULTS: Diseased human  MV leaflets were obtained during cardiac surgery for MVP; normal MV leaflets were  obtained from heart transplants. MV RNA was used for microarray analysis of MVP  patients versus control, highlighting genes that indicate the involvement of 5HTR  pathways and extracellular matrix remodeling in MVP. Human MV leaflets were also  studied in vitro and ex vivo with biomechanical testing to assess remodeling in  the presence of a 5HTR2B antagonist (LY272015). MVP leaflets from Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels were used as a naturally acquired in vivo model of MVP. These  canine MVP leaflets (N=5/group) showed 5HTR2B upregulation. This study also  utilized CB57.1ML/6 mice in order to determine the effect of Angiotensin II  infusion on MV remodeling. Histological analysis showed that MV thickening due to  chronic Angiotensin II remodeling is mitigated by a 5HTR2B antagonist (LY272015)  but not by 5HTR2A inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In humans, MVP is associated with an  upregulation in 5HTR2B expression and increased 5HT receptor signaling in the  leaflets. Antagonism of 5HTR2B mitigates MVIC activation in vitro and MV  remodeling in vivo. These observations support the view that 5HTR signaling is  involved not only in previously reported 5HT-related valvulopathies, but it is  also involved in the pathological remodeling of MVP.","2018-02","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","94-103","","","115","","J Mol Cell Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A retrospective cohort study of dogs with DMVD attending  primary-care practices in England was undertaken. Cases of DMVD were identified  within the electronic patient records (EPRs) of practices sharing data with  VetCompass. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to explore survival and Cox regression  models identified factors associated with hazard of death. The EPRs from 111,967  dogs, attending 93 veterinary practices between January 2010 and December 2011  identified 405 cases diagnosed with DMVD giving a prevalence of diagnosed DMVD of  0.36% (95% CI: 0.29-0.45%). A further 3557 dogs were classified as possible cases  (heart murmurs consistent with DMVD). Overall, a total of 3962 dogs were  classified as heart murmur cases (possible and diagnosed DMVD), giving a  prevalence of 3.54% (95% CI: 3.26-3.84%). One hundred and sixteen (28.6%) of the  diagnosed DMVD cases were incident, newly diagnosed with DMVD. The mean age at  diagnosis was 9.52 years (95% CI: 8.98-10.14 years). Fifty-eight (50.0%) of the  incident cases died during the study period. The median survival time (MST) for  all-cause mortality was 25.4 months (95% CI: 20.4-34.4 months) after disease  detection for DMVD cases. For possible cases, 121 (29.7%) from a random sample of  407 possible DMVD cases were incident cases (newly detected heart murmur  consistent with DMVD during the study period). The mean age at which a heart  murmur was first recorded in possible cases was 9.73 years (95% CI: 9.02-10.44  years). Forty-nine (40.5%) possible cases died during the study period. The MST  for all-cause mortality was 33.8 months (95% CI: 23.7-43.1 months) after a heart  murmur was initially detected. In the multivariable survival analysis for  possible and diagnosed cases, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and other  purebreds had higher hazards of death than crossbreds. Dogs weighing ≥20.0kg and  older dogs had an increased hazard of death compared with those <20.0kg and  younger dogs, respectively. The study highlights poorer survival for all-cause  mortality in CKCSs and larger dogs. The reported survival characteristics could  aid veterinary surgeons' advice on the prognosis for dogs with DMVD and help the  assessment of the impact of the condition at a population level.","2015-12-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","436-442","","4","122","","Prev Vet Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to assemble 41 variants of the  previously reported genes and to investigate these variants in canine DLBCL using  the Agena MassARRAY platform. These variants were chosen based on the high  prevalence observed in canine B- and T-cell lymphomas, their significance for  target therapy, and compatibility for multiplex PCR amplification. Lymph node  biopsy was performed from 60 dogs with B-cell lymphoma comprising 47 purebred and  13 crossbred dogs. All dogs presented single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at  HYAL4 and SATB1 genes. The lesser mutual SNPs were observed at SEL1L, excluding a  cocker spaniel, and c-Kit, with the exception of a pug and a French bulldog. Even  though no statistical association was noted between each SNP and dog breed,  purebreds were 3.88 times more likely to have a SNP at FLT3 rs852342480 (95%CI  0.50-45.03, p = 0.26), 3.64 times at TRAF3 F306X (95%CI 0.58-42.50, p = 0.43) and  2.66 times at TRAF3 E303EX (95%CI 0.56-13.12, p = 0.31). Also, DLBCL dogs  (CHOP-based treatment) with c-Kit T425= had a poorer prognosis with shorter  median overall survival times (OST) than dogs with the wild type. Dogs treated  with COP chemotherapy and contained 3-5 variants at SEL1L were associated with  decreased median OST. Therefore, this SNP's lymphoma panel provides valuable  information that we can use to outline a prognosis and develop a treatment plan  for the targeted therapy of each dog.","2022-03-24","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","5120","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

However, the epidemiology of PNMG in the  wider dog population remains understudied. METHODS: Using de-identified clinical  data from the VetCompass Programme, this cohort study aimed to report the  prevalence, demographic and breed-related risk factors of PNMG in dogs attending  UK primary care veterinary practices in 2016. RESULTS: There were 1,802 PNMG  cases identified from 905,543 dogs, yielding an annual prevalence of 0.20% (95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.21). The median age at first diagnosis was 0.63  years (IQR 0.33-1.98, range 0.11-18.00). Dogs aged under 1 year had 10.82 times  the odds (95% CI 9.17-12.76) compared with dogs aged from 2 to under 4 years.  Neutered animals had higher odds than entire animals within both sexes. Breeds  with the highest odds of PNMG compared with crossbred dogs included Neapolitan  Mastiff (odds ratio (OR) 34.26, 95%CI 15.92-73.75), English Bulldog (OR 24.08,  95% CI 20.62-28.13), Cane Corso (OR 14.66, 95% CI 8.18-26.28), Lhasa Apso (OR  12.37, 95% CI 10.26-14.92) and American Cocker Spaniel (OR 11.57, 95% CI  5.59-23.96). Purebred dogs had 1.43 times the odds (95% CI 1.26-1.63) of PNMG  compared with crossbreed dogs.

Insured dogs had 1.89 times the odds (95% CI 1.65-2.16)  compared with uninsured dogs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the largest cohort  of primary-care PNMG cases assembled to date. The results showing young age at  diagnosis along with the breed, purebred and brachycephalic skull conformation  predispositions suggest a hereditary involvement in PNMG development. These  results may help to guide breeding strategies to reduce the prevalence of PNMG  and improve welfare in predisposed individuals.","2022","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0260538","","1","17","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35081121  PMCID: PMC8791520","","","","Animals; Dogs; Breeding; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Genotype; Cohort Studies; United Kingdom/epidemiology; Disease Susceptibility; Dog Diseases/epidemiology; Eyelid Diseases/*epidemiology/veterinary; Nictitating Membrane/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The RC's cardiological  database was analysed, and 1,779 clinical records were included in a  retrospective observation study. Descriptive statistics and frequencies regarding  the most representative breeds and CHDs were generated. A logistic regression  model was used to analyse the trends of the most common CHDs found in single and  in cluster of breeds. The relationship between breed popularity and presence of  CHDs was studied. The most common CHDs were Pulmonic Stenosis, Patent Ductus  Arteriosus, Subaortic Stenosis, Ventricular Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis,  Tricuspid Dysplasia, Atrial Septal Defect, Double Chamber Right Ventricle, Mitral  Dysplasia, and others less frequent. The most represented pure breeds were Boxer,  German Shepherd, French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Maltese, Newfoundland,  Rottweiler, Golden Retriever, Chihuahua, and others in lower percentage.  Chihuahuas, American Staffordshire Terriers, Border Collies, French Bulldogs, and  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel were the most appreciated all of which showed a  high value of volatility. This study found evidence for the value of the  screening program implemented in Boxers; fashions and trends influence dog  owners' choices more than the worries of health problems in a breed.

HYPOTHESIS: Pimobendan in addition to conventional therapy will extend time to  sudden cardiac death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure when  compared with conventional therapy plus benazepril in dogs with congestive heart  failure (CHF) attributable to MMVD. ANIMALS: Two hundred and sixty client-owned  dogs in CHF caused by MMVD were recruited from 28 centers in Europe, Canada, and  Australia. METHODS: A prospective single-blinded study with dogs randomized to PO  receive pimobendan (0.4-0.6 mg/kg/d) or benazepril hydrochloride (0.25-1.0  mg/kg/d). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, euthanized for  heart failure, or treatment failure. RESULTS: Eight dogs were excluded from  analysis. One hundred and twenty-four dogs were randomized to pimobendan and 128  to benazepril. One hundred and ninety dogs reached the primary endpoint; the  median time was 188 days (267 days for pimobendan, 140 days for benazepril hazard  ratio = 0.688, 95% confidence limits [CL]=0.516-0.916, P= .0099). The benefit of  pimobendan persisted after adjusting for all baseline variables. A longer time to  reach the endpoint was also associated with being a Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel, requiring a lower furosemide dose, and having a higher creatinine  concentration. Increases in several indicators of cardiac enlargement (left  atrial to aortic root ratio, vertebral heart scale, and percentage increase in  left ventricular internal diameter in systole) were associated with a shorter  time to endpoint, as was a worse tolerance for exercise.

After conversion to the yeast phase  within the lung, the organism is subsequently disseminated to other tissues by  macrophages. Nasal histoplasmosis appears to be a rare condition in dogs. CASE  PRESENTATION: We report the clinical case of a 4.5-year-old male neutered Cocker  spaniel/Poodle mix, 7.7 kg, body condition score 6/9, that presented with a  3-month history of sneezing and left-sided mucoid nasal discharge. The history  also included a mild swelling (transient) of the right carpus with a lameness  (grade II-III/IV), coinciding with the onset of sneezing and nasal discharge. The  dog lived primarily indoors in the Texas Gulf Coast area. On physical  examination, the dog was febrile, and the left nostril was swollen, ulcerative,  deformed, and hypopigmented. Mandibular lymph nodes were firm and mildly enlarged  bilaterally. Mild lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglobulinemia were  noted. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Computed tomography and rhinoscopy  revealed swelling of the rostral portion of the left and right nasal passages.  Cytology and histology of biopsies of the affected nasal tissue showed  pyogranulomatous inflammation and yeast organisms consistent with H. capsulatum.  Weak antigenuria was detected on the MVista H. capsulatum antigen test. Treatment  with oral itraconazole led to a resolution of the nasal signs and normalization  of the appearance of the nostril over 13 weeks, and neither antigenuria nor  antigenemia was detected on several recheck examinations. The dog remained in  good general and physical condition and showed no signs of disease recurrence  more than 6 years after the last examination. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case  of nasal mucocutaneous histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent dog, with an  excellent clinical response to oral itraconazole. This case documents that  histoplasmosis in dogs can affect primarily the nasal cavity, which responds  rapidly to triazole antifungal therapy and has a good prognosis.

This  report describes the use of an absorbable and non absorbable novel polymer  fixation method, Bonewelding® technology, in combination with titanium mesh for  the repair of calvarial defects in two dogs. The clinical outcomes and  comparative complication using resorbable and non-resorbable thermoplastic pins  were compared. CASE PRESENTATION: This report of two cases documents the repair  of a traumatic calvarial fracture in an adult male Greyhound and a cranioplasty  following frontal bone tumor resection in an adult female Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel with the use of a commercially available titanium mesh secured with an  innovative thermoplastic polymer screw system (Bonewelding®). The treatment  combination aimed to restore cranial structure, sinus integrity and cosmetic  appearance. A mouldable titanium mesh was cut to fit the bone defect of the  frontal bone and secured with either resorbable or non-resorbable polymer pins  using Bonewelding® technology. Gentamycin-impregnated collagen sponge was used  intraoperatively to assist with sealing of the frontal sinuses. Calvarial  fracture and post-operative implant positioning were advised using computed  tomography. A satisfactory restoration of skull integrity and cosmetic result was  achieved, and long term clinical outcome was deemed clinically adequate with good  patient quality of life. Postoperative complications including rostral mesh  uplift with minor associated clinical signs were encountered when resorbable pins  were used. No postoperative complications were experienced in non-resorbable pins  at 7 months follow-up, by contrast mesh uplift was noted 3 weeks post-procedure  in the case treated using absorbable pins. CONCLUSIONS: The report demonstrates  the innovative use of sonic-activated polymer pins (Bonewelding® technology)  alongside titanium mesh is a suitable alternative technique for skull defect  repair in dogs. The use of Bonewelding® may offer advantages in reduction of  surgical time. Further, ultrasonic pin application may be less invasive than  alternative metallic fixation and potentially reduces bone trauma. Polymer  systems may offer enhanced mesh-bone integration when compared to traditional  metallic implants. The use of polymer pins demonstrates initial potential as a  fixation method in cranioplasty. Initial findings in a single case comparison  indicate a possible advantage in the use of non-absorbable over the absorbable  systems to circumvent complications associated with variable polymer degradation,  further long term studies with higher patient numbers are required before  reliable conclusions can be made.","2018-06-22","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","199","","1","14","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29929513  PMCID: PMC6013898","","","","Animals; Female; Male; Dog Diseases/*surgery; Dogs/*injuries/surgery; Bone Screws/veterinary; Bioresorbable; Bonewelding®; Calvarial defect; Frontal Bone/*injuries/surgery; Non-resorbable; Polymer pins; Polymers/therapeutic use; Skull Fractures/surgery/*veterinary; Skull Neoplasms/surgery/*veterinary; Surgical Mesh/*veterinary; Titanium mesh; Titanium/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the numerous genes associated with human  polygenic obesity is MC4R, encoding the melanocortin 4 receptor. The aim of our  study was to analyze polymorphisms and methylation of the canine MC4R in relation  to adiposity. Altogether 270 dogs representing four breeds predisposed to  obesity: Labrador Retriever (n = 187), Golden Retriever (n = 38), Beagle (n = 28)  and Cocker Spaniel (n = 17), were studied. The dogs were classified into three  groups: lean, overweight and obese, according to the 5-point Body Condition Score  (BCS) scale. In the cohort of Labradors a complete phenotypic data (age, sex,  neutering status, body weight and BCS) were collected for 127 dogs. The entire  coding sequence as well as 5' and 3'-flanking regions of the studied gene were  sequenced and six polymorphic sites were reported. Genotype frequencies differed  considerably between breeds and Labrador Retrievers appeared to be the less  polymorphic. Moreover, distribution of some polymorphic variants differed  significantly (P < 0.05) between small cohorts with diverse BCS in Golden  Retrievers (c.777T>C, c.868C>T and c.*33C>G) and Beagles (c.-435T>C and  c.637G>T). On the contrary, in Labradors no association between the studied  polymorphisms and BCS or body weight was observed. Methylation analysis, using  bisulfite DNA conversion followed by Sanger sequencing, was carried out for 12  dogs with BCS = 3 and 12 dogs with BCS = 5. Two intragenic CpG islands,  containing 19 cytosines, were analyzed and the methylation profile did not differ  significantly between lean and obese animals. We conclude that an association of  the MC4R gene polymorphism with dog obesity or body weight is unlikely, in spite  of the fact that some associations were found in small cohorts of Beagles and  Golden Retrievers. Also methylation level of this gene is not related with dog  adiposity.","2017-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","333-339","","4","44","","Mol Biol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 28755272  PMCID: PMC5579139","","","","Animals; Dogs; Genotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Base Sequence; Labrador Retriever; Obesity; 3' Flanking Region; Adiposity/*genetics; Beagle; Body weight; Body Weight/genetics; DNA Methylation/genetics; Golden Retriever; MC4R; Methylation; Obesity/genetics/metabolism; Overweight/genetics; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4/blood/*genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN:  Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 48 dogs, 51 eyes with primary glaucoma. PROCEDURE:  Medical records from two large private clinical ophthalmology services were  reviewed. Signalment, duration of glaucoma, gonioscopic evaluation, laser power  and duration settings, immediate postoperative and final intraocular pressure and  visual results, short and long-term visual outcome, and surgical complications  were recorded. RESULTS: The age range of affected dogs was 3.0-14.0 years, with a  mean age of 7.5 +/- 2.6 years. Eleven pure breeds were represented, with the most  common being the American Cocker Spaniel. The sex distribution was 22 neutered  males, 1 intact male, 23 spayed females, and 2 intact female dogs. The right eye  was affected in 33 cases, and the left eye in 18 cases. The average total joules,  which was administered with the diode laser, was 109.6 +/- 23.6 J. Immediate  surgical complications included fibrin formation in the anterior chamber (15),  corneal ulcers (4), hyphema (7), and focal retinal detachment (1). Long-term  complications included cataract formation (8 total, 2 of which were significant,  vision-threatening), elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (6), unstable  gonioimplant (1), and glaucoma recurrence (14). Additional surgeries performed on  the eyes over the course of study included: intrascleral prosthesis (4),  enucleation (1), resection of fibrotic scar tissue (5), and repeat laser  cycloablation (8). The dogs were examined for a mean follow-up time of 17.6  months (range: 2-83 months postoperatively). Twenty-nine cases were followed  greater than one year. Vision was maintained in 42/51 eyes (82%) in the immediate  short-term of this study. In all cases included in the study, good control of IOP  was achieved in 39/51 (76%) of eyes, and IOP was poor or uncontrolled in 12/51  (24%) of eyes. Twenty out of 41 eyes (49%) maintained fair to excellent vision  six months after surgery. Twelve months postoperative observations demonstrated  that 12/29 (41%) of the eyes were still visual. CONCLUSIONS: In primary glaucoma,  the combined procedure of laser diode cyclophotocoagulation and Ahmed valve  implant was associated with return or maintenance of vision in 42/51 eyes (82%)  in the immediate short-term of this study, and a long-term IOP control in 39/51  (76%) of the cases, with 12/29 eyes (41%) visual after 12 months.","2005-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","121-127","","2","8","","Vet Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15762925","","","","Animals; Dogs; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Records/veterinary; Dog Diseases/epidemiology/pathology/*surgery; Glaucoma Drainage Implants/veterinary; Glaucoma/surgery/*veterinary; Laser Coagulation/veterinary; New York/epidemiology; Postoperative Complications/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three different associated variants have been identified  in dogs: 1 in Border Collies, 1 in mixed breed dogs, and 1 in Spaniels and  Pointers. OBJECTIVES: To clinically and genetically characterize CIP in a family  of mixed breed dogs. ANIMALS: Two mixed breed dogs from the same litter were  independently presented: 1 for evaluation of painless fractures, and the other  for chronic thermal skin injuries. METHODS: Physical, neurological, and  histopathological evaluations were performed. Whole genome sequencing of 1  affected dog was used to identify homozygous protein-changing variants that were  not present in 926 control genomes from diverse dog breeds. RESULTS: Physical and  neurological examinations showed the absence of superficial and deep pain  perception in the entire body. Histopathological evaluations of the brain, spinal  cord and sensory ganglia were normal. Whole genome sequencing identified a  homozygous missense variant in SCN9A, XM_038584713.1:c.2761C>T or  XP_038440641.1:(p.Arg921Cys). Both affected dogs were homozygous for the mutant  allele, which was not detected in 926 dogs of different breeds. CONCLUSIONS AND  CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We confirmed the diagnosis of CIP in a family of mixed breed  dogs and identified a likely pathogenic variant in the SCN9A gene. The clinical  signs observed in these dogs mimic those reported in humans with pathogenic SCN9A  variants causing CIP. This report is the first of a spontaneous pathogenic SCN9A  variant in domestic animals.","2023-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","230-235","","1","37","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Seminomas (SEM), Sertoli cell tumors (SCT), and interstitial cell  tumors (ICT) are the most common histological diagnoses, but their incidence  shows high variability among studies. Our aim is to report the results on the  analysis of testicular tumors recorded by the population-based Umbria Canine  Cancer Registry (CCR) for a 5-year time period and to assess the value of tumor  major diameter, measured during trimming, in discriminating neoplastic from  non-neoplastic lesions. The study was conducted on 388 testicular tumors (on 1969  total male tumors) diagnosed in 355 dogs from 2014 to 2018. The median incidence  was 35 cases/100,000 dogs, with a proportion equal to 19,7 % of all tumors. The  incidence on neutered male dogs was 352/100,000. Most tumors were ICTs (50 %),  with fewer SEMs and SCTs (29 % and 17 %, respectively). Only 3 % of tumors were  mixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumors (MGC-SCST). Ten percent of cases had  multiple tumors in the same testicle, with SEM-ICT being prevalent (69.2 %).  Tumors in cryptorchid testes were 5.9 % of the total, mostly SCT (60.9 %). Mean  age at diagnosis was 10.7 ± 2.7, with similar values for different tumor types.  Significant incidence ratios (IRR) were found in Golden retriever (IRR 7.18, CI95  % 4.72-10.92) and in English cocker spaniel (IRR 2.30, CI95 % 1.28-4.13) when  compared with mixed breed dogs. A value of 0.3 cm (major diameter) of lesions at  the moment of trimming was helpful in discriminating a final tumor histological  diagnosis from a non-tumor lesion. Since the number of tumors included in this  evaluation was limited, further studies to confirm the diagnostic value of this  measure are recommended. Our results provided information on the incidence of  canine testicular tumors in Umbria region that can be compared with future  results and incidence from other geographical areas if provided with reliable  data on the total population, can offer solid information on the incidence and  proportion of different tumor types in specific territories, contributing also to  the supervision of its inhabitants' health. Moreover, pathological data such as  the major diameter of tumors can be obtained and contribute to diagnostic routine  and standardization.","2020-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","105201","","","185","","Prev Vet Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Retroperitoneal cystic  lymphatic malformations have not been described previously in canine patients and  neither has the use of immunohistochemistry to determine their origin, i.e.  vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female  Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria and a painful abdomen.  Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid filled structure  adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a thin walled  cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from the  retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for  histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within  the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was  lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood  vessels were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence  11 months later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort  (Norfolk Animal products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation,  progression occurred with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and  abdominal cavities and the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and  positive immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial  hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1)  confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To  our experience, a definitive diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic malformation of  lymphatic origin could be done only by combining the clinical presentation,  advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1 immunohistochemistry. This  is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog where  immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic  malformation, even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential  diagnosis in a patient with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing  serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results of this case report can aid in diagnosis of  future cases, however, further studies on therapy and management are needed to  provide additional information about optimal treatment of these patients.","2020-02-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","8","","1","62","","Acta Vet Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32007092  PMCID: PMC6995647","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Canine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/veterinary; Euthanasia, Animal; Immunohistochemistry; Computed tomography; Bladder; Cyst; Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/surgery; Histopathology; LYVE-1; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery; PROX-1; Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*veterinary; Retroperitoneal Space/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether  plasma cardiac biomarkers, clinical signs, and physical examination findings are  associated with clinical progression (reaching the composite endpoint of  initiation of treatment with a potent diuretic or cardiac death) in dogs presumed  to have stage B DMVD. ANIMALS: Six-hundred and eighty-four dogs diagnosed with  DMVD recruited from 73 primary care practices in the United Kingdom. Dogs were  not receiving potent diuretics at recruitment. METHODS: Prospective cohort study  design. Primary care veterinarians recorded the presence or absence of clinical  signs and physical examination findings.

Auto antibodies of the IgG subclass against IgE may affect the detection of serum  IgE by immunoassay and may be important in the regulation of IgE production by B  cells. ELISA were developed to detect serum antibodies specific for IgE using a  newly available canine monoclonal IgE of known antigen specificity, generated  from a canine x murine heterohybridoma. To test for correlation of auto IgG  anti-IgE levels with manifestation of atopic dermatitis, the sera from 101 atopic  dogs were compared with sera from non-atopic dogs of various breeds, foxhounds  manifesting clinical signs of demodectic acariasis and helminth parasitized  random bred dogs for quantities of IgG anti-IgE measured in units/ml compared to  a high titer standard serum. To test for serum effects on quantitation of IgE,  known amounts of canine monoclonal IgE were added to various sera and measured by  capture ELISA with detecting monoclonal antibodies specific for heat labile or  heat stabile epitopes. Unheated sera from dogs manifesting clinical atopic  dermatitis and helminth parasitized dogs had levels of IgG anti-IgE that were  significantly lower than various breeds of dogs not manifesting dermatologic  lesions and foxhounds manifesting demodectic acariasis. Heating sera at 56  degrees C for 3 h to denature the high affinity binding site on the IgE heavy  chain caused a marked increase over non-heated sera in detectable IgG anti-IgE in  almost all dogs. This increase was most profound in helminth-infected dogs and  foxhounds manifesting demodectic mange with 7 fold increases each, respectively,  and in atopic dogs with a 5 fold increase compared to 3 fold increases for  clinically-normal springer spaniels and all soft coated wheaten terriers. The  terriers demonstrated an association of lower heated serum values of IgG anti-IgE  with manifestation of a familial syndrome of protein-losing enteropathy and  protein-losing nephropathy. The ability of mouse anti-canine IgE monoclonal  antibodies specific for either heat labile or heat stabile epitopes to detect  canine monoclonal IgE added to sera in known amounts varied from serum to serum  and at different concentrations of the same serum, but did not correlate with IgG  anti-IgE values for these sera. The range of absolute levels of serum IgE in dogs  showing little or no inhibition of detection of added IgE was < 0.5  ng/micromilligram to 2 micrograms/micromilligram. It was concluded that the  increase in detectable IgG anti-IgE after heating sera indicates that IgG x IgE  immune complexes are normally present in most dogs; however, the increase over  uncomplexed IgG anti-IgE was most pronounced in dogs manifesting atopic  dermatitis and demodectic acariasis. A quantitative comparison of IgG anti-IgE or  IgG x IgE to total serum IgE was not made because the ability of monoclonal  antibodies specific for either heat labile or heat stable epitopes on the IgE  heavy chain to detect IgE added to serum, as well as innate serum IgE, was highly  variable in different dilutions of serum from individual to individual.","1997-12-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","33-46","","1-2","60","","Vet Immunol Immunopathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 9533265","","","","Animals; Dogs; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Dog Diseases/*immunology; Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*blood; Antigen-Antibody Complex/*blood; Ascariasis/immunology/*veterinary; Autoantibodies/*blood; Dermatitis, Atopic/immunology/*veterinary; Helminthiasis, Animal/*immunology; Immunoglobulin E/*blood; Immunoglobulin G/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have reported epidemiological associations suggesting that large  body mass, long bone length and the genetics of certain breeds including the  Rottweiler are associated with elevated osteosarcoma risk. However, these studies  were often limited by selection bias and confounding factors, and have rarely  offered insights into breed-associated protection for osteosarcoma. The current  study includes 1756 appendicular and axial osteosarcoma cases presenting to VPG  Histology (Bristol, UK) compared against a control population of 905,211 dogs  without osteosarcoma from primary care electronic patient records in the  VetCompass™ dataset. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study.  Multivariable logistic regression analysis explored associations between  demographic risk factors (including breed, chondrodystrophy, age, sex/neuter  status, skull-shape, and body mass) and osteosarcoma of all anatomical sites.  RESULTS: We identified several breeds with increased and reduced odds of  osteosarcoma. At highest risk were the Rottweiler and Great Dane, with > 10 times  the odds of osteosarcoma compared with crossbreds, and the Rhodesian Ridgeback,  which has not featured in previous lists of at-risk breeds for osteosarcoma, and  had an odds ratio of 11.31 (95% confidence interval 7.37-17.35). Breeds at lowest  risk of osteosarcoma (protected breeds) included the Bichon Frise, the French  Bulldog and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, all with odd ratios of less than  0.30 compared with crossbreds. Body mass was strongly associated with  osteosarcoma risk; dogs over 40 kg exhibited osteosarcoma odds of 45.44 (95%  confidence interval 33.74-61.20) compared with dogs less than 10 kg.  Chondrodystrophic breeds had an osteosarcoma odds ratio of 0.13 (95% confidence  interval 0.11-0.16) compared with non-chondrodystrophic breeds. CONCLUSIONS: This  study provides evidence of strong breed-associated osteosarcoma risk and  protection, suggesting a genetic basis for osteosarcoma pathogenesis. It  highlights that breeds selected for long legs/large body mass are generally  overrepresented amongst at-risk breeds, whilst those selected for short leg  length/small body mass are generally protected. These findings could inform  genetic studies to identify osteosarcoma risk alleles in canines and humans; as  well as increasing awareness amongst veterinarians and owners, resulting in  improved breeding practices and clinical management of osteosarcoma in dogs.","2021-03-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","2","","1","8","","Canine Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33750475  PMCID: PMC7944903","","","","Pedigree; Dog; Electronic patient record; EPR; VetCompass; Neoplasia; Breed; Epidemiology; Purebred; Bone tumour; Cancer; Osteosarcoma; Primary-care; Veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A randomized controlled study on relapse control through telemedicine system.","Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing","","1365-2850 1351-0126","10.1111/jpm.12251","","ACCESSIBLE SUMMARY: Exposure to psychotic states has detrimental effects on the long-term outcome of schizophrenia and brain integrity. Therefore, improving  relapse prevention is a key component of long-term management of schizophrenia.  Previous studies using continuous monitoring of an individual's early signs of  relapse and adopting preventative pharmacological interventions, when early signs  are detected, showed promising clinical results in terms of relapse risk  reduction. This 18-month multi-centre parallel randomized controlled, open label,  trial with telemedicine relapse prevention programme ITAREPS failed to show  superiority of maintenance plus prodrome-based targeted medication strategy over  treatment as usual. The study, marked by low investigator's adherence, confirmed  that absence of pharmacological intervention at early stage of prodrome,  critically influenced the risk of relapse. This and previous randomized  controlled trials with telemedicine programme ITAREPS suggested that substantial  improvement in relapse prevention in schizophrenia is likely to be unattainable  under current clinical settings. Future preventive strategies in schizophrenia  would require rapid pharmacological intervention upon occurrence of subclinical  prodromal symptoms that are undetectable under conventional outpatient practice.  Studies with ITAREPS suggested that integration of telemedicine relapse  prevention systems and visiting nurse service might together represent practical  solution capable to address those requirements. ABSTRACT: The Information  Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) presents  a telemedicine solution for weekly monitoring and management of schizophrenia.  This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in reducing the  number of hospitalizations during the 18-month multi-centre parallel randomized  controlled, open label, trial. Outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective  disorder were randomized to the active (n = 74) or control group (n = 72). In the  active arm, investigators increased the antipsychotic dose upon occurrence of  prodrome announced by the system. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no  between-group difference in the hospitalization-free survival rate [Kaplan-Meier  method; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-2.61, P =  0.6). In a post hoc multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, out of 13  potential predictors, only ITAREPS-related variables (number of alerts without  pharmacological intervention/HR = 1.38, P = 0.042/ and patient non-adherence with  ITAREPS /HR = 1.08, P = 0.009/) increased the risk of hospitalization. In this  trial ITAREPS was not effective. The results in context with previous ITAREPS  studies suggest non-adherence of both psychiatrists and patients as the main  reasons for the failure of this preventive strategy. Tertiary prevention in  schizophrenia have to be regarded a major challenge, warranting the need for  implementation of strategies with more active participation of both patient and  treating psychiatrist.","2015-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","811-820","","10","22","","J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26176646","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Recurrence; Adult; Middle Aged; Schizophrenia/*prevention & control; Telemedicine/*methods; schizophrenia; *Patient Compliance; antipsychotic medication; hospitalizations; information technology; psychotic disorders; Psychotic Disorders/*prevention & control; relapse prevention; Secondary Prevention/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we set out to describe the epidemiology of canine mammary cancer in  the Canary Archipelago, Spain. We analysed a pathology tumour registry (PTR) and  identified 7362 samples obtained from 5240 female dogs resident on the Canary  Archipelago during an 18-year period (2003-2020). Using a case-control study  design, we compared mammary tumour affected dogs with the Canarian canine  population registry in order to elucidate the breed associations for these  tumours. RESULTS: The frequency of a diagnosis of mammary tumours relative to all  tumour diagnoses in female dogs decreased during the study period from 62.7% to  48.9%. Contemporaneously, the proportion of dogs diagnosed with mammary tumours  who were also neutered increased from 13.6% to 26.9%. There was a negative  correlation (R = -0.84) between these changes. Additional findings were that: the  proportion of female dogs diagnosed with multiple tumours increased by 23.5% and  that the proportion of malignant tumours 89.2% diagnosed has remained stable  through the period. Benign mammary tumours were diagnosed at younger ages  (9.2 years old) than carcinomas (9.7 years old) and sarcomas (10.4 years old).  Epithelial mammary tumours were diagnosed at younger ages in entire female dogs.  Samoyed, Schnauzer, Poodle, German Pinscher and Cocker Spaniel were the breeds  with the highest odds-ratios (OR) in comparison with the reference (crossbreeds)  while Miniature Pinscher, American Staffordshire Terrier, English Pointer as well  as some local breeds such as the Canary Warren Hound and the Majorero had the  lowest ORs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a description of the changing  epidemiology of canine mammary cancer in the Canary Archipelago over the last two  decades. We found high rates of CMT with a significant predominance of malignant  tumours. Exact risk factors are uncertain, but a combination of environmental,  regional socioeconomic affecting human and their pets, and animal management  factors are likely to play a part. Specifically, neutering was negatively  associated with the proportion of epithelial mammary gland tumours and breeds  native to the region were at lower risk of mammary tumours. A deeper analysis of  all these factors will facilitate a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of  mammary gland tumours in both the canine and the human population.","2022-07-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","268","","1","18","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Pulmonary hypertension, in  turn, can lead to severe damage of the right-sided cardiac structures, leading to  right ventricular remodeling and tricuspid valve regurgitation. CASE  PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female English Cocker Spaniel was presented  to the author's institution because of abdominal distention and exercise  intolerance. Ascites caused by congestive right-sided heart failure was found to  be responsible for these problems. The underlying etiology of the right-sided  heart failure was a severe pulmonary hypertension caused by Angiostrongylus  vasorum infection. Echocardiography revealed, in addition to a severe concentric  and eccentric right ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial and pulmonary trunk  dilation, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a systolic flail of the  anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve, resulting from ruptured chordae  tendineae. As a coincidental finding, a congenital mitral stenosis was found.  Oral therapy was initiated with daily administration of fenbendazole for 2 weeks  along with daily administration of oral sildenafil until the re-check  examination. At the 6-week re-check the dog showed full clinical and partial  echocardiographic recovery, and both the blood antigen test for Angiostrongylus  vasorum and the fecal Baermann larva isolation test were negative. When the  sildenafil therapy was ceased after tapering the daily dosage, the owner reported  recurrence of abdominal distension. Re-starting the sildenafil therapy resulted  in resolution of this problem. The dog was reported to be clinically healthy with  daily sildenafil administration 7 months after the initial presentation.  CONCLUSIONS: The present case report describes a dog where angiostrongylosis led  to congestive right-sided heart failure resulting from severe pulmonary  hypertension. The secondary right ventricular eccentric hypertrophy together with  suspected papillary muscular ischemia were the suspected cause of the ruptured  major tricuspid chordae tendineae, which led to a severe tricuspid valve  regurgitation. Despite eradication of the worms, the severe pulmonary  hypertension persisted. Treatment with daily oral sildenafil, a pulmonary  arterial vasodilator, was enough to keep the dog free of clinically apparent  ascites.","2020-08-26","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","311","","1","16","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32847583  PMCID: PMC7448988","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Vasodilator Agents/therapeutic use; Fenbendazole; Congestive heart failure; Ascites; Hypertension, Pulmonary/complications/veterinary; Angiostrongylus; Antinematodal Agents/therapeutic use; Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy/parasitology; Fenbendazole/therapeutic use; Flail leaflet; Heart Failure/drug therapy/*veterinary; Heart Valve Diseases/complications/diagnosis/parasitology/*veterinary; Heartworm; Mitral stenosis; Sildenafil; Sildenafil Citrate/therapeutic use; Strongylida Infections/complications/drug therapy/*veterinary; Tricuspid Valve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vaccination of dogs against leptospirosis is an  important approach to preventing clinical disease, or reducing disease severity,  as well as reducing transmission of the infection to humans. Although it is  generally considered to be a 'core' vaccine, there is limited information on the  level of leptospirosis vaccine usage and factors associated with its usage in  dogs in the UK. The study aimed to report the uptake of leptospirosis vaccination  and factors associated with its usage in a cohort of dogs under primary  veterinary care during a 12-month period. RESULTS: From a population of 905,543  dogs, 49% (95%CI 48.9-49.1%) had at least one leptospirosis vaccine administered  during the 12 months of study. Adult dogs had reduced odds of receiving a  leptospirosis vaccine when compared to dogs < 1 year old, with dogs > 8 years old  having a greater than ten-fold reduction in odds (OR = 0.08, 95%CI 0.07-0.09).  Odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine was increased in insured dogs when  compared to uninsured dogs (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.17-1.28). Neutered dogs had  reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine (OR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.83-0.91).  Breed associations with receiving a leptospirosis vaccine varied. Several breeds  were associated with increased odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine when  compared to crossbreed dogs, including Border Terriers (OR = 1.49, 95%CI  1.42-1.57), Golden Retrievers (OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.24-1.37), Cocker Spaniels  (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.31) and West Highland White Terriers (OR = 1.27, 95%CI  1.22-1.31). French Bulldogs (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.62-0.67), Staffordshire Bull  Terriers (OR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.78-0.82) and Pugs (OR = 0.91, 95%CI =0.88-0.95) had  significantly reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccination during the  study. CONCLUSION: This work identified that almost half of the UK primary care  attending population received a leptospirosis vaccine during the year. Several  demographic variables were associated with leptospirosis vaccine administration,  with age being particularly important. Both the proportion of uptake and factors  associated with leptospirosis vaccine usage can be used as a benchmark for  comparisons in the future. Additionally, an understanding of which populations  have reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine can potentially be used  for initiatives to encourage owner vaccination uptake in these groups.","2022-07-22","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","285","","1","18","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis identified 88  canine patients presenting with unilateral acute congestive primary angle-closure  glaucoma (IOP > 25 mm Hg) and gonioscopic findings of pectinate ligament  dysplasia and/or narrow or closed iridocorneal angle in the contralateral  nonglaucomatous eye. Patients with histopathologic confirmation of pectinate  ligament dysplasia or angle closure in the initial glaucomatous eye receiving  prophylactic medical therapy in the contralateral eye were included. Time to  medical failure for each antiglaucoma medication and efficacy of the combination  therapy were evaluated. RESULTS: The most commonly affected pure-breds were the  American Cocker Spaniel (20.4%) and Basset Hound (11.36%). The patients receiving  demecarium bromide 0.125% had the longest estimated median time to medical  failure at 330.0 days, followed by latanoprost 0.005%, dorzolamide hydrochloride  2.0%, and demecarium bromide 0.25% at 284.0 days, 272.5 days, and 143.0 days,  respectively. The estimated median time to medical failure for patients receiving  topical antiglaucoma and anti-inflammatory medication was 324.0 days versus 195.0  days in patients receiving antiglaucoma medication alone.

Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is characterized by different stages of  severity and trend of RAAS activity during the course of the disease is still  uncertain. The urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) has been proven  to reflect RAAS activation in dogs and might be a useful marker in monitoring  therapy and disease progression, but data about this parameter need to be  expanded. The objective of this study was to evaluate the UAldo:C in healthy dogs  and dogs with naturally occurring MMVD, and to investigate the relationships  between this parameter and clinical, echocardiographic and laboratory variables.  RESULTS: The study population consisted of 149 dogs: 49 healthy and 100 MMVD dogs  (45 stage B1, 13 stage B2 and 42 stage C). Urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine  ratio was not significantly different among healthy and MMVD dogs of any stages.  Breed, sex and age showed a significant impact on UAldo:C. In particular,  Chihuahua and Cavalier King Charles spaniel showed significantly higher UAldo:C  than other breeds, as well as intact females than other genders. In stage C dogs,  UAldo:C appeared to be increased by spironolactone and was positively associated  with furosemide dose (P = 0.024). Aldosterone breakthrough (ABT) appeared to  occur in 36% (8/22) of stage C dogs not receiving spironolactone. A significant  positive association between UAldo:C and left atrium-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao)  was found. CONCLUSIONS: Individual factors such as breed, sex and age appeared to  influence UAldo:C, and therapy seemed to add further variability. In the light of  these results, comparing the UAldo:C of a single patient with a population-based  reference value might lead to wrong interpretations and an individual monitoring  should be considered. The prevalence of ABT in the present study (36%) was in  line with those previously reported. However, due to the high individual  variability of UAldo:C found in the study, even this result should be  re-evaluated in the setting of an individual longitudinal approach. The positive  association between UAldo:C and LA/Ao supports the mutual relationship between  RAAS and cardiac remodeling.","2021-01-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","15","","1","17","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33413406  PMCID: PMC7792040","","","","Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Dog; Dog Diseases/drug therapy/*pathology; Renin-Angiotensin System; Mitral Valve/pathology; Heart Valve Diseases/urine/*veterinary; Aldosterone/*urine; Creatinine/*urine; Aldosterone; Furosemide/administration & dosage; LA/Ao; MMVD; RAAS; Spironolactone/administration & dosage; UAldo:C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary-care veterinary clinical data are now recognised as a valuable  research resource. Using data from the VetCompass Programme, this study aimed to  report the frequency and risk factors for elbow joint disease in dogs under  primary veterinary care in the UK and describe clinical management. RESULTS: From  455,069 dogs under veterinary care, the one-year period prevalence for elbow  joint disease diagnosis was 0.56% (95% CI: 0.53-0.60). Of 616 incident cases, the  most common specific variants of elbow joint disease were osteoarthritis  (n = 468, 75.97%), elbow dysplasia (190, 30.84%) and traumatic (41, 6.66%). The  most common signs described by the owners were lameness (n = 466, 75.65%),  difficulty exercising (123, 19.97%) and pain (86, 13.96%). The most common  findings recorded on veterinary examination were pain (n = 283, 45.94%), lameness  (278, 45.13%) and reduced range of movement (243, 39.45%). Common medications  used included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 544, 88.31%), tramadol  (121, 19.64%) and disease modifying agents (118, 19.16%). Of 109 deaths involving  euthanasia with information available from the 616 incident cases, elbow joint  disease contributed to the decision to euthanase in 45 (41.28%) dogs.Five breeds  showed increased odds of elbow joint disease compared with crossbred dogs:  Rottweiler (OR: 6.16, 95% CI 3.89-9.75), Labrador Retriever (OR: 5.94, 95% CI  4.65-7.60), German Shepherd Dog (OR: 4.13, 95% CI 2.88-5.93), Golden Retriever  (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.93-5.00) and English Springer Spaniel (OR: 2.00, 95% CI  1.26-3.18). Additional risk factors included having an adult bodyweight that was  equal or higher than their breed/sex mean, advancing age, being male, being  neutered, being insured and larger bodyweight. CONCLUSIONS: Elbow joint disease  is a relatively common diagnosis in dogs and has a high welfare impact as  evidenced by the high proportion of cases recorded with pain, lameness and  analgesic therapy. There are strong breed predispositions, in particular for  large breed dogs. These findings present a clear case for improved breeding  programmes to reduce the burden of elbow joint disease.","2020","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1","","","7","","Canine Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s). 2020.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32835227  PMCID: PMC7371807","","","","VetCompass; First opinion; General practice; Arthritis; Degenerative joint disease; Elbow dysplasia; Osteoarthritis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although  lipomas are reportedly common in dogs, no studies have specifically investigated  risk factors associated with their occurrence. This study was a large-scale  retrospective analysis of electronic patient records of dogs attending practices  participating in VetCompass™. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression  methods were used to evaluate associations between risk factors and primary-care  veterinary diagnosis of lipoma. RESULTS: From 384,284 dogs under veterinary care  during 2013 at 215 primary practice clinics in the UK, there were 2765 lipoma  cases identified giving a one-year prevalence of 1.94% (95% CI: 1.87-2.01).  Breeds with the highest lipoma prevalence included Weimaraner (7.84%, 95% CI  6.46-9.40), Dobermann Pinscher (6.96%, 95% CI 5.67-8.44), German Pointer (5.23%,  95% CI 3.93-6.80), Springer Spaniel (5.19%, 95% CI 4.76-5.66), and Labrador  Retriever (5.15%, 95% CI 4.90-5.41). Dogs with an adult bodyweight equal or  higher than their breed/sex mean had 1.96 (95% CI 1.81-2.14, P <  0.001) times  the odds of lipoma compared with dogs that weighed below their breed/sex mean.  The odds of lipoma increased as adult bodyweight increased. Increased age was  strongly associated with increasing odds of lipoma. Compared with dogs aged 3.0  to < 6.0 years, dogs aged 9.0 - < 12.0 years had 17.52 times the odds (95% CI  14.71-20.85, P <  0.001) of lipoma. Neutered males (OR: 1.99, 95% CI 1.69-2.36,  P <  0.001) and neutered females (OR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.37-1.91, P <  0.001) had  higher odds than entire females. Insured dogs had 1.78 (95% CI 1.53-2.07,  P <  0.001) times the odds of lipoma compared with uninsured dogs. CONCLUSIONS:  Lipomas appear to be a relatively common diagnosis in primary-care practice.  Certain breeds were identified with remarkably high lipoma prevalence,  highlighting the risk that owners should be prepared for. Lipoma predisposition  of larger bodyweight individuals within breed/sex suggests that being overweight  or obese may be a predisposing factor but would need further work to confirm.","2018","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","9","","","5","","Canine Genet Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30279993  PMCID: PMC6161450","","","","VetCompass; First opinion; General practice; Fatty mass; Lipoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In people, epilepsy has been associated with a  reduction in brain volume. The objective was to estimate the volume of the  forebrain (FB), subarachnoid space (SAS) and lateral ventricles (LV) in dogs with  IE compared to controls using Cavalieri's principle. MRI scans of case and  control dogs were identified from two neurology referral hospital databases.  Eight breeds with increased odds of having IE were included: Golden Retriever,  Labrador Retriever, Cocker Spaniel, Border terrier, German Shepherd dog, Parson  Jack Russell terrier, Boxer, and Border Collie. Five dogs of each breed with IE  and up to five controls were systematically and uniformly randomly sampled  (SURS). The volume of the FB, SAS and LV were estimated from MRI scans by one  blinded observer using Cavalieri's principle. RESULTS: One hundred-two dogs were  identified; 56 were diagnosed with IE and 46 were controls. There was no  statistically significant difference in FB, SAS and LV volume between dogs with  IE and controls. Dogs with a history of status epilepticus had significantly  larger FB than those without (p = 0.05). There was a border-line trend for LV  volume to increase with increasing length of seizure history in the IE group  (p = 0.055). CONCLUSION: The volumes of the FB, SAS and LV are not different  between dogs with IE and controls, so IE remains a diagnosis of exclusion with no  specific neuroanatomical biomarkers identified. This is the first time FB and SAS  volume has been compared in dogs with IE. Unfortunately, we have shown that the  results reporting significantly larger FBs in dogs with status epilepticus and LV  volume increase with length of seizure history were likely confounded by breed  and should be interpreted cautiously. Whilst these associations are interesting  and clinically relevant, further investigation with breed-specific or larger,  breed-diverse populations are required to permit strong conclusions. The  Cavalieri principle provided an effective estimation of FB, SAS and LV volumes on  MRI, but may be too time-intensive for use in clinical practice.","2021-03-10","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","3","","1","8","","Canine Med Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33691781  PMCID: PMC7944915","","","","Canine; Brain volume; Cavalieri principle; Design-based stereology; Forebrain; Idiopathic epilepsy; Lateral ventricles; Subarachnoid space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine whether the abundance of  miR-122 in cancer tissue is influenced by the nature of the underlying virus  infection, we measured miR-122 by qRT-PCR in paired tumor and non-tumor tissues  from cohorts of HBV- and HCV-infected Japanese patients. miR-122 abundance was  significantly reduced from normal in HBV-associated HCC, but not in liver cancer  associated with HCV infection. This difference was independent of the degree of  differentiation of the liver cancer. Surprisingly, we also found significant  differences in miR-122 expression in non-tumor tissue, with miR-122 abundance  reduced from normal in HCV- but not HBV-infected liver. Similar differences were  observed in HCV- vs. HBV-infected chimpanzees. Among HCV-infected Japanese  subjects, reductions in miR-122 abundance in non-tumor tissue were associated  with a single nucleotide polymorphism near the IL28B gene that predicts poor  response to interferon-based therapy (TG vs. TT genotype at rs8099917), and  correlated negatively with the abundance of multiple interferon-stimulated gene  transcripts. Reduced levels of miR-122 in chronic hepatitis C thus appear to be  associated with endogenous interferon responses to the virus, while differences  in miR-122 expression in HCV- versus HBV-associated HCC likely reflect  virus-specific mechanisms contributing to carcinogenesis. The continued  expression of miR-122 in HCV-associated HCC may signify an important role for HCV  replication late in the progression to malignancy.","2013","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e76867","","10","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24130799  PMCID: PMC3793926","","","","Animals; Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Asian People/*genetics; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/complications/genetics/pathology/*virology; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects; Hepatitis B/*complications; Hepatitis C/*complications; Interferons/pharmacology; Liver Neoplasms/complications/genetics/pathology/*virology; Liver/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology/virology; MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism; Pan troglodytes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is recurrent, with a long-term evolution in most cases. Early  treatment and continuous monitoring have proven to be very effective in  mitigating the causes and consequences of BD. However, no tools are currently  available for a massive and semi-automatic BD patient monitoring and control.  Taking advantage of recent technological developments in the field of wearables,  this paper studies the feasibility of a BD episodes classification analysis while  using entropy measures, an approach successfully applied in a myriad of other  physiological frameworks. This is a very difficult task, since actigraphy records  are highly non-stationary and corrupted with artifacts (no activity). The method  devised uses a preprocessing stage to extract epochs of activity, and then  applies a quantification measure, Slope Entropy, recently proposed, which  outperforms the most common entropy measures used in biomedical time series. The  results confirm the feasibility of the approach proposed, since the three states  that are involved in BD, depression, mania, and remission, can be significantly  distinguished.","2020-11-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","11","22","","Entropy (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 33287011  PMCID: PMC7711446","","","","actigraphy; bipolar disorder; permutation entropy; sample entropy; slope entropy; time series classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One-year prospective follow-up field study.","International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice","","1365-1501","10.1080/13651500500305424","","Objectives. Relapse prevention is one of the most important goals of long-term schizophrenia management, as relapse is both distressing and costly. Family  intervention supplementation to standard treatment could reduce the relapse rate.  This study assessed the influence of a short-term, clinically based, and  profesionally led family psychoeducation programme on a 1-year relapse rate.  Methods. A total of 120 patients were recruited upon discharge from two  psychiatric hospitals in Prague: (1) Site A (N=86), where family psychoeducation  is offered to all patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and  acute psychotic episode with schizophrenic symptoms; and (2) Site B (N=34), where  no such programme was offered. Results. Compared to nonparticipants,  psychoeducation participants had a shorter average length of rehospitalization  stay (5.89 vs. 17.78 days, P=0.045) in a 1-year follow-up after discharge. The  probability of rehospitalization during a 1-year follow-up was higher for  patients from the site that did not provide psychoeducation. Conclusions. A  shorter average length of rehospitalization of psychoeducation participants, a  high turnout of first-episode patients, and positive responses of psychoeducation  participants suggest that family psychoeducation should be supplemented early in  the course of the illness to achieve favourable treatment outcomes and minimize  adverse health and the social consequences of schizophrenia.","2006","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","38-44","","1","10","","Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24926767","","","","quality of life; schizophrenia; relapse prevention; Family psychoeducation; first episode psychosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a consequence of genome doubling,  polyploids often exhibit greater colonizing ability or occupy a wider ecological  niche than diploids. Although elevation has been traditionally considered as a  key driver structuring ploidy variation, we do not know if environmental and  phenotypic differentiation among ploidy cytotypes varies along an elevational  gradient. Here, we tested for the consequences of genome duplication on genetic  diversity, phenotypic variation and habitat preferences on closely related  diploid and tetraploid populations that coexist along approx. 2300 m of varying  elevation. METHODS: We sampled and phenotyped 45 natural diploid and tetraploid  populations of Arabidopsis arenosa in one mountain range in Central Europe  (Western Carpathians) and recorded abiotic and biotic variables at each  collection site. We inferred genetic variation, population structure and  demographic history in a sub-set of 29 populations genotyped for approx. 36 000  single nucleotide polymorphisms. KEY RESULTS: We found minor effects of  polyploidy on colonization of alpine stands and low genetic differentiation  between the two cytotypes, mirroring recent divergence of the polyploids from the  local diploid lineage and repeated reticulation events among the cytotypes. This  pattern was corroborated by the absence of ecological niche differentiation  between the two cytotypes and overall phenotypic similarity at a given elevation.  CONCLUSIONS: The case of A. arenosa contrasts with previous studies that  frequently showed clear niche differentiation between cytotypes. Our work  stresses the importance of considering genetic structure and past demographic  processes when interpreting the patterns of ploidy distributions, especially in  species that underwent recent polyploidization events.","2019-09-24","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","255-268","","2","124","","Ann Bot","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2019.

However, such barriers favouring  cytotype coexistence have only rarely been explored. Here, an assessment is made  of the mechanisms involved in formation of mixed-ploidy populations and  coexistence of diploid plants and their closely related allotetraploid derivates  from the Centaurea stoebe complex (Asteraceae). METHODS: An investigation was  made of microspatial and microhabitat distribution, life-history and fitness  traits, flowering phenology, genetic relatedness of cytotypes and intercytotype  gene flow (cpDNA and microsatellites) in six mixed-ploidy populations in Central  Europe. KEY RESULTS: Diploids and tetraploids were genetically differentiated,  thus corroborating the secondary origin of contact zones. The cytotypes were  spatially segregated at all sites studied, with tetraploids colonizing  preferentially drier and open microhabitats created by human-induced  disturbances. Conversely, they were rare in more natural microsites and  microsites with denser vegetation despite their superior persistence ability  (polycarpic life cycle). The seed set of tetraploid plants was strongly  influenced by their frequency in mixed-ploidy populations. Triploid hybrids  originated from bidirectional hybridizations were extremely rare and almost  completely sterile, indicating a strong postzygotic barrier between cytotypes.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that tetraploids are later immigrants into  already established diploid populations and that anthropogenic activities  creating open niches favouring propagule introductions were the major factor  shaping the non-random distribution and habitat segregation of cytotypes at fine  spatial scale. Establishment and spread of tetraploids was further facilitated by  their superior persistence through the perennial life cycle. The results  highlight the importance of non-adaptive spatio-temporal processes in explaining  microhabitat and microspatial segregation of cytotypes.","2012-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","615-627","","3","110","","Ann Bot","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22730023  PMCID: PMC3400448","","","","Genetic Variation; Phylogeography; *Diploidy; *Ecosystem; *Hybridization, Genetic; *Tetraploidy; Austria; Biological Evolution; Centaurea/*genetics; Gene Flow; Population Dynamics; Slovakia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study explores this phenomenon in a  group of eastern Asian Cardamine species. METHODS: Plant material was sampled  from 59 localities in Japan and Korea, which were used in karyological  (chromosome counting) and flow cytometric analyses. The absolute nuclear DNA  content (in pg) was measured using propidium iodide and the relative nuclear DNA  content (in arbitrary units) was measured using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  fluorochrome. KEY RESULTS: Substantial cytotype diversity was found, with  strikingly different distribution patterns between the species. Two cytotypes  were found in C. torrentis sensu lato (4x and 8x, in C. valida and C. torrentis  sensu stricto, respectively), which displays a north-south geographical pattern  in Japan. Hypotheses regarding their origin and colonization history in the  Japanese archipelago are discussed. In Korean C. amaraeiformis, only tetraploids  were found, and these populations may in fact belong to C. valida. C. yezoensis  was found to harbour as many as six cytotypes in Japan, ranging from hexa- to  dodecaploids. Ploidy levels do not show any obvious geographical pattern;  populations with mixed ploidy levels, containing two to four cytotypes, are  frequently observed throughout the range. C. schinziana, an endemic of Hokkaido,  has hexa- and octoploid populations. Previous chromosome records are also  revised, showing that they are largely based on misidentified material or  misinterpreted names. CONCLUSIONS: Sampling of multiple populations and  utilization of the efficient flow cytometric approach allowed the detection of  large-scale variation in ploidy levels and genome size variation attributable to  aneuploidy.

A series of clinical studies has  demonstrated that the prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of  treatment in responders to antidepressants and that this effect precedes clinical  improvement. Ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA) receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect but its influence on  theta cordance is unknown. METHOD: In a double-blind, cross-over,  placebo-controlled experiment we studied the acute effect of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg  within 30 min) on theta cordance in a group of 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS:  Ketamine infusion induced a decrease in prefrontal theta cordance and an increase  in the central region theta cordance after 10 and 30 min. The change in  prefrontal theta cordance correlated with ketamine and norketamine blood levels  after 10 min of ketamine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ketamine  infusion immediately induces changes similar to those that monoamineric-based  antidepressants induce gradually. The reduction in theta cordance could be a  marker and a predictor of the fast-acting antidepressant effect of ketamine, a  hypothesis that could be tested in depressive patients treated with ketamine.","2010-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1443-1451","","9","40","","Psychol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19995475","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Biomarkers; Predictive Value of Tests; Double-Blind Method; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Affect/drug effects; Anesthetics, Dissociative/blood/*pharmacology; Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy; Electroencephalography/*drug effects; Ketamine/analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacology; Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects; Theta Rhythm/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hybridization is a  potent source of novelty, but nascent hybrid lineages must overcome reproductive  and ecological competition from their parental species. Here, we assess whether  hybrid speciation is advantageous over alternative modes of speciation, by  comparing the geographical and ecological ranges and climatic niche evolutionary  rates of stabilized allopolyploid vs. autopolyploids in the Alyssum montanum  species complex. METHODS: We combined an extensive review of studies addressing  the systematics and genetic diversity of A. montanum s.l., with flow cytometry  and cloning of nuclear markers, to establish the ploidy level and putative hybrid  nature of 205 populations. The respective geographic distribution and climatic  niche evolution dynamics of the allo- and autopolyploids were investigated using  multivariate analyses and comparative phylogenetic approaches. KEY RESULTS: As  expected by theory, allopolyploids occur mainly along contact zones and are  generally spatially overlapping with their diploid counterparts. However, they  demonstrate higher rates of niche evolution and expand into different climatic  conditions than those of their diploid congeners. In contrast, autopolyploids  show lower rates of niche evolution, occupy ecological niches similar to their  ancestors and are restricted to less competitive and peripheral geographic areas.  CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization thus seems advantageous by promoting ecological niche  evolution and more readily allowing escape from competitive exclusion.","2016-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1348-1357","","7","103","","Am J Bot","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 Botanical Society of America.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27206461","","","","*Genetic Variation; Geography; Climate; Phylogeny; allopolyploidy; Brassicaceae; *Hybridization, Genetic; Biological Evolution; *Ploidies; autopolyploidy; Brassicaceae/*genetics; competition; Diploidy; diversification; ecological novelty; Ecology; local adaptation; minority cytotype disadvantage; transgressive segregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 18FDG PET covariation study.","Neuro endocrinology letters","","0172-780X","","","OBJECTIVES: With the aim to indicate the functional anatomical substrate of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia we evaluated the relationship between  resting brain metabolism and performance on the Trail Making Test (TMT). As the  prerequisite analysis we compared the performance in Part A and B of the TMT  between schizophrenic patients and controls. Resting brain metabolism was  investigated by (18)FDG positron emission tomography (PET) as the probe for the  relative regional synaptic strength and density. METHODS: (18)FDG PET data were  analyzed by SPM99 with TMT A and B as the covariate (p< or =0.001). RESULTS:  Schizophrenic patients (N=42) had worse performance in both TMT A and B compared  to controls (N=42). In schizophrenic subjects (18)FDG PET did not predict the  performance on Part A (psychomotor speed) but predicted that for Part B  (set-shifting and flexibility) of the TMT. The (18)FDG uptake in the superior,  middle and inferior frontal gyruses bilaterally was associated with better  performance in the TMT B. The negative covariation between 18FDG uptake and time  spent in the TMT B was detected in the temporal and parietal cortices, pre- and  postcentral gyruses, precuneus limbic regions (anterior cingulate, uncus) and the  pons.

The tribe Alysseae, in the family Brassicaceae,  epitomizes this evolutionary trend. In this lineage, some genera, like  Hormathophylla, can serve as a good case for testing the evolutionary framework.  This genus is centered in the western Mediterranean. It grows on different  substrates, but mostly on alkaline soils. It has been suggested that  diversification in many lineages of the tribe Alysseae and in the genus  Hormathophylla is linked to a tolerance for high levels of Mg+2 in xeric  environments. In this study, we investigated the controversial phylogenetic  placement of Hormathophylla in the tribe, the generic limits and the evolutionary  relationships between the species using ribosomal and plastid DNA sequences. We  also examined the putative association between the evolution of different ploidy  levels, trichome morphology and the type of substrates. Our analyses demonstrated  the monophyly of the genus Hormathophylla including all previously described  species. Nuclear sequences revealed two lineages that differ in basic chromosome  numbers (x = 7 and x = 8 or derived 11, 15) and in their trichome morphology.  Contrasting results with plastid genes indicates more complex relationships  between these two lineages involving recent hybridization processes. We also  found an association between chloroplast haplotypes and substrate, especially in  populations growing on dolomites. Finally, our dated phylogeny demonstrates that  the origin of the genus took place in the mid-Miocene, during the establishment  of temporal land bridges between the Tethys and Paratethys seas, with a later  diversification during the upper Pliocene.","2018","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e0208307","","12","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30576314  PMCID: PMC6303028","","","","Species Specificity; Time Factors; Haplotypes/genetics; Base Sequence; Genetic Variation; Ploidies; Phylogeography; Likelihood Functions; Bayes Theorem; Chromosomes, Plant/genetics; *Phylogeny; Alkalies/*chemistry; Brassicaceae/*genetics/ultrastructure; Cell Nucleus/*genetics; Magnesium/*chemistry; Mediterranean Region; Plastids/*genetics; Ribosomes/genetics; Soil/*chemistry; Trichomes/ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  the neural bases of these deficits still remain unclear. Along with the  task-related fMRI and EEG research tapping into the mirror neuron system, the  characteristics of the resting state activity in the particular areas that  encompass mirror neurons might be of interest as they obviously determine the  baseline of the neuronal activity. Using resting state fMRI, we investigated  resting state functional connectivity (FC) in four predefined brain structures,  ROIs (inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, premotor cortex and  superior temporal gyrus), known for their mirror neurons activity, in 12 patients  with first psychotic episode and 12 matched healthy individuals. As a specific  hypothesis, based on the knowledge of the anatomical inputs of thalamus to all  preselected ROIs, we have investigated the FC between thalamus and the ROIs. Of  all ROIs included, seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis revealed significantly  decreased FC only in left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the areas  in visual cortex and cerebellum in patients as compared to controls. Using  ROI-to-ROI analysis (thalamus and selected ROIs), we have found an increased FC  of STG and bilateral thalamus whereas the FC of these areas was decreased in  controls. Our results suggest that: (1) schizophrenia patients exhibit FC of STG  which corresponds to the previously reported changes of superior temporal gyrus  in schizophrenia and might contribute to the disturbances of specific functions,  such as emotional processing or spatial awareness; (2) as the thalamus plays a  pivotal role in the sensory gating, providing the filtering of the redundant  stimulation, the observed hyperconnectivity between the thalami and the STGs in  patients with schizophrenia might explain the sequential overload with sensory  inputs that leads to the abnormal cognitive processing.","2015-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","S269-272","","","27 Suppl 1","","Psychiatr Danub","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Croatia PMID: 26417778","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; *Brain Mapping; Brain/*physiopathology; Mirror Neurons/*physiology; Neural Pathways/*physiopathology; Schizophrenia/*physiopathology; Temporal Lobe/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reasons for this heterogeneity remain  unknown. Obesity is disproportionately frequent already early in the course of  psychosis and is associated with smaller brain volumes. Thus, we hypothesized  that obesity may contribute to brain changes in FEP. METHOD: We analyzed MRI  scans from 120 participants with FEP and 114 healthy participants. In primary  analyses, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with small volume  corrections to regions associated with FEP or obesity in previous meta-analyses.  In secondary analyses, we performed whole-brain VBM analyses. RESULTS: In primary  analyses, we found that when controlling for BMI, FEP had lower GM volume than  healthy participants in a) left fronto-temporal region (pTFCE = 0.008) and b)  left postcentral gyrus (pTFCE = 0.043). When controlling for FEP, BMI was  associated with lower GM volume in left cerebellum (pTFCE < 0.001). In secondary  analyses, we found that when controlling for BMI, FEP had lower GM volume than  healthy participants in the a) cerebellum (pTFCE = 0.004), b) left frontal (pTFCE  = 0.024), and c) right temporal cortex (pTFCE = 0.031). When controlling for FEP,  BMI was associated with lower GM volume in cerebellum (pTFCE = 0.004). Levels of  C-reactive protein, HDL and LDL-cholesterol correlated with obesity related  neurostructural alterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that higher BMI,  which is frequent in FEP, may contribute to cerebellar alterations in  schizophrenia. As previous studies showed that obesity-related brain alterations  may be reversible, our ﬁndings raise the possibility that improving the screening  for and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic changes could preserve  brain structure in FEP.","2020","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","556759","","","11","","Front Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Kolenič, Španiel, Hlinka, Matějka, Knytl, Šebela, Renka and Hajek.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 33173508  PMCID: PMC7538831","","","","schizophrenia; obesity; dyslipidemia; first-episode psychosis; low-grade inflammation; voxel-based morphometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, validated,  quick, and scalable digital self-report measures that can also detect relapse are  still not available for clinical care. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to  validate the newly developed ASERT (Aktibipo Self-rating) questionnaire-a  10-item, mobile app-based, self-report mood questionnaire consisting of 4  depression, 4 mania, and 2 nonspecific symptom items, each with 5 possible  answers. The validation data set is a subset of the ongoing observational  longitudinal AKTIBIPO400 study for the long-term monitoring of mood and activity  (via actigraphy) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Patients with confirmed  BD are included and monitored with weekly ASERT questionnaires and monthly  clinical scales (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] and Young  Mania Rating Scale [YMRS]). METHODS: The content validity of the ASERT  questionnaire was assessed using principal component analysis, and the Cronbach α  was used to assess the internal consistency of each factor. The convergent  validity of the depressive or manic items of the ASERT questionnaire with the  MADRS and YMRS, respectively, was assessed using a linear mixed-effects model and  linear correlation analyses. In addition, we investigated the capability of the  ASERT questionnaire to distinguish relapse (YMRS≥15 and MADRS≥15) from a  nonrelapse (interepisode) state (YMRS<15 and MADRS<15) using a logistic  mixed-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients with BD were included in  this study (follow-up: mean 754 days, SD 266) and completed an average of 78.1%  (SD 18.3%) of the requested ASERT assessments (completion time for the 10 ASERT  questions: median 24.0 seconds) across all patients in this study. The ASERT  depression items were highly associated with MADRS total scores (P<.001;  bootstrap). Similarly, ASERT mania items were highly associated with YMRS total  scores (P<.001; bootstrap). Furthermore, the logistic mixed-effects regression  model for scale-based relapse detection showed high detection accuracy in a  repeated holdout validation for both depression (accuracy=85%; sensitivity=69.9%;  specificity=88.4%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.880)  and mania (accuracy=87.5%; sensitivity=64.9%; specificity=89.9%; area under the  receiver operating characteristic curve=0.844).

Despite its evolutionary importance, the stability of spatial  segregation is largely unknown. Furthermore, closely related sympatric cytotypes  that differ in their life histories might exhibit contrasting spatial dynamics  over time. We studied the temporal stability of spatial structure at a secondary  contact zone of co-occurring monocarpic diploids and polycarpic tetraploids of  Centaurea stoebe, whose tetraploid cytotype has undergone a rapid range expansion  in Europe and became invasive in North America. Eleven years after the initial  screening, we re-assessed the microspatial distribution of diploids and  tetraploids and their affinities to varying vegetation-cover density in three  mixed-ploidy populations in Central Europe. We found that overall, spatial  patterns and frequencies of both cytotypes in all sites were very similar over  time, with one exception. At one site, in one previously purely 2x patch,  diploids completely disappeared due to intensive succession by shrubby  vegetation. The remaining spatial patterns, however, showed the same cytotype  clumping and higher frequency of 2x despite subtle changes in vegetation-cover  densities. In contrast to the expected expansion of polycarpic tetraploids having  higher colonization ability when compared to diploids, the tetraploids remained  confined to their former microsites and showed no spatial expansion. Spatial  patterns of coexisting diploids and tetraploids, which exhibit contrasting life  histories, did not change over more than a decade. Such temporal stability is  likely caused by relatively stable habitat conditions and very limited seed  dispersal. Our results thus imply that in the absence of a disturbance regime  connected with frequent human- or animal-mediated seed dispersal, spatial  patterns may be very stable over time, thus contributing to the long-term  coexistence of cytotypes.","2022-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","plac052","","6","14","","AoB Plants","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.

However, most of the data  available has been gathered from chronic patients, and was therefore possibly  confounded by factors such as duration of the disease, and treatment received.  The extent and localization of these changes is also not clear. METHODS: We  examined a population of early stage SZ patients using diffusion tensor imaging  (DTI). 77 SZ patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the analysis  using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). We have also analyzed 250 randomly  created subsets of the original cohort, to investigate the relation between the  result of TBSS analysis, and the size of the sample studied. RESULTS: We have  found a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the patient group.  This change is present in most major white matter (WM) tracts including the  corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior  fronto-occipital fasciculus, and posterior thalamic radiation. Furthermore, we  identified a clear trend towards an increase in the number and spatial extent of  significant voxels reported, with an increasing number of subjects included in  the analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that FA is significantly decreased in  patients at an early stage of schizophrenia, and that the extent of this finding  is dependent on the size of studied sample; therefore underpowered studies might  produce results with false spatial localization.","2015-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","22-28","","1-3","162","","Schizophr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The microemulsion using thymol and eugenol (5.0 + 5.0 mg/mL) had as vehicles  water, propylene glycol, polysorbate 80 and canola oil. On the next day the  preparation (formulation freshly prepared) and after 24 months, the size of the  microemulsion droplets, polydispersion index (PdI), organoleptic properties  (color, viscosity), and presence of precipitate in the microemulsion were  evaluated. For the field assay, on day -1, 10 English Cocker Spaniel dogs were  experimentally infested with 200 larvae, 100 nymphs and 30 adults of R.  sanguineus s.l. On day 0, after tick counts, the animals were divided into two  groups: treated with the freshly prepared microemulsion (10 mL/kg), and control,  which received the vehicle (10 mL/kg). Tick counts on dogs were performed daily  for three more days. Engorged females were recovered from the dogs and their  biological and reproductive parameters were monitored. The dogs' clinical  parameters (temperature, mucosa color, and general physical condition) were  evaluated daily. In addition, blood samples were collected before infestation to  verify hematological (packed cell volume) and biochemical parameters (total serum  protein, albumin, globulins, creatinine, urea, alanine transaminase, aspartate  aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase). Freshly prepared and 24-month aged  microemulsions had droplets with mean sizes of 30.94 nm and 27.93 nm, and PdI  values of 0.214 and 0.161, respectively. In addition, no difference in the  organoleptic properties and no precipitation formation were observed, indicating  physical stability. Treatment with the microemulsion resulted in reduction of  larvae (p < 0.05) parasitizing the dogs on day 1 while the number of nymphs and  adults was not reduced (P> 0.05). In the evaluation of the reproductive biology  of engorged females, the larval hatchability (%) was compromised (p < 0.05), and  the microemulsion had control rate of 85.5 %. The microemulsion and its vehicles  did not change the clinical, hematological and biochemical parameters of the  dogs. We concluded that the microemulsion was efficient against R. sanguineus  s.l. by reducing the number of larvae and affecting the reproductive parameters  of engorged females, safe for dogs, and stable (physical stability) during a  two-year interval.","2021-08","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","109501","","","296","","Vet Parasitol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Machine learning/pattern  recognition allows us to estimate the biological age of the brain from structural  magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI). The discrepancy between brain and  chronological age could contribute to early detection and differentiation of BD  and schizophrenia. METHODS: We estimated brain age in 2 studies focusing on early  stages of schizophrenia or BD. In the first study, we recruited 43 participants  with first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (FES) and 43 controls. In  the second study, we included 96 offspring of bipolar parents (48 unaffected, 48  affected) and 60 controls. We used relevance vector regression trained on an  independent sample of 504 controls to estimate the brain age of study  participants from structural MRI. We calculated the brain-age gap estimate  (BrainAGE) score by subtracting the chronological age from the brain age.  RESULTS: Participants with FES had higher BrainAGE scores than controls (F(1, 83)  = 8.79, corrected P = .008, Cohen's d = 0.64). Their brain age was on average  2.64 ± 4.15 years greater than their chronological age (matched t(42) = 4.36, P <  .001). In contrast, participants at risk or in the early stages of BD showed  comparable BrainAGE scores to controls (F(2,149) = 1.04, corrected P = .70, η2 =  0.01) and comparable brain and chronological age. CONCLUSIONS: Early stages of  schizophrenia, but not early stages of BD, were associated with advanced BrainAGE  scores. Participants with FES showed neurostructural alterations, which made  their brains appear 2.64 years older than their chronological age.

The hexaploid  Cardamine schulzii was regarded as one of the few nascent allopolyploid species  formed within the past ∼150 years that presumably arose by autopolyploidization  of a triploid hybrid, C. × insueta; however, the most recent investigations have  shown that it is a trigenomic hybrid. The aims of this study were to explore the  efficiency of progenitor-specific microsatellite markers in detecting the hybrid  origins and genome composition of these two allopolyploids, to estimate the  frequency of polyploid formation events, and to outline their evolutionary  potential for long-term persistence and speciation. METHODS: Flow-cytometric  ploidy-level screening and genotyping by progenitor-specific microsatellite  markers (20 microsatellite loci) were carried out on samples focused on  hybridizing populations at Urnerboden, Switzerland, but also including  comparative material of the parental species from other sites in the Alps and  more distant areas. KEY RESULTS: It was confirmed that hybridization between the  diploids C. amara and C. rivularis auct. gave rise to triploid C. × insueta, and  it is inferred that this has occurred repeatedly. Evidence is provided that C.  schulzii comprises three parental genomes and supports its origin from  hybridization events between C. × insueta and the locally co-occurring  hypotetraploid C. pratensis, leading to two cytotypes of C. schulzii:  hypopentaploid and hypohexaploid. Each cytotype of C. schulzii is genetically  uniform, suggesting their single origins. CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of C. schulzii  has presumably been achieved only by perennial growth and clonal reproduction.  This contrasts with C. × insueta, in which multiple origins and occasional sexual  reproduction have generated sufficient genetic variation for long-term survival  and evolutionary success. This study illustrates a complex case of recurrent  hybridization and polyploidization events, and highlights the role of triploids  that promoted the origin of trigenomic hybrids.","2014-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","817-830","","5","113","","Ann Bot","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24577071  PMCID: PMC3962249","","","","Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Genetic Markers; Phylogeny; Switzerland; Brassicaceae; *Microsatellite Repeats; *Hybridization, Genetic; Flow Cytometry; *Biological Evolution; *DNA, Plant; *Polyploidy; Allopolyploidy; Alps; Cardamine × insueta; Cardamine schulzii; Cardamine/*genetics; hybridization; microsatellites; neoallopolyploidy; polyploid evolution; speciation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was repeatedly reported that low frequency  (<or=1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) diminishes  treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations. A neuroimaging study elucidating the  effect of rTMS in auditory hallucinations has yet to be published. OBJECTIVE: To  evaluate the distribution of neuronal electrical activity and the brain  metabolism changes after low-frequency rTMS in patients with auditory  hallucinations. METHODS: Low-frequency rTMS (0.9 Hz, 100% of motor threshold, 20  min) applied to the left temporoparietal cortex was used for 10 days in the  treatment of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia (n =  12). The effect of rTMS on the low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography  (LORETA) and brain metabolism ((18)FDG PET) was measured before and after 2 weeks  of treatment. RESULTS: We found a significant improvement in the total and  positive symptoms (PANSS), and on the hallucination scales (HCS, AHRS). The rTMS  decreased the brain metabolism in the left superior temporal gyrus and in  interconnected regions, and effected increases in the contralateral cortex and in  the frontal lobes. We detected a decrease in current densities (LORETA) for the  beta-1 and beta-3 bands in the left temporal lobe whereas an increase was found  for beta-2 band contralaterally. CONCLUSION: Our findings implicate that the  effect is connected with decreased metabolism in the cortex underlying the rTMS  site, while facilitation of metabolism is propagated by transcallosal and  intrahemispheric connections. The LORETA indicates that the neuroplastic changes  affect the functional laterality and provide the substrate for a metabolic  effect.","2007","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","132-142","","3-4","55","","Neuropsychobiology","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2007 S.

Our aim was  to examine the cognitive profiles of first-episode schizophrenia spectrum  disorder (FES) subjects based on cluster analysis, and to correlate these  profiles with clinical variables and resting state brain connectivity, as  measured with magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 67 FES subjects were  assessed with a neuropsychological test battery and on clinical variables. The  results of the cognitive domains were cluster analyzed. In addition, functional  connectivity was calculated using ROI-to-ROI analysis with four groups: Three  groups were defined based on the cluster analysis of cognitive performance and a  control group with a normal cognitive performance. The connectivity was compared  between the patient clusters and controls. We found different cognitive profiles  based on three clusters: Cluster 1: decline in the attention, working  memory/flexibility, and verbal memory domains. Cluster 2: decline in the verbal  memory domain and above average performance in the attention domain. Cluster 3:  generalized and severe deficit in all of the cognitive domains. FES diagnoses  were distributed among all of the clusters. Cluster comparisons in neural  connectivity also showed differences between the groups. Cluster 1 showed both  hyperconnectivity between the cerebellum and precentral gyrus, the salience  network (SN) (insula cortex), and fronto-parietal network (FPN) as well as  between the PreCG and SN (insula cortex) and hypoconnectivity between the default  mode network (DMN) and seeds of SN [insula and supramarginal gyrus (SMG)];  Cluster 2 showed hyperconnectivity between the DMN and cerebellum, SN (insula)  and precentral gyrus, and FPN and IFG; Cluster 3 showed hypoconnectivity between  the DMN and SN (insula) and SN (SMG) and pallidum.

Yet  little is known whether polyploidy may also shape belowground interactions.  METHODS: To elucidate potential ploidy-specific interactions with arbuscular  mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), we compared mycorrhizal colonization and assembly of AMF  communities in roots of diploid and tetraploid Centaurea stoebe s.l. (Asteraceae)  co-occurring in a Central European population. In a follow-up greenhouse  experiment, we tested inter-cytotype differences in mycorrhizal growth response  by combining ploidy, substrate, and inoculation with native AMF in a  full-factorial design. KEY RESULTS: All sampled plants were highly colonized by  AMF, with the Glomeraceae predominating. AMF-community composition revealed by  454-pyrosequencing reflected the spatial distribution of the hosts, but not their  ploidy level or soil characteristics. In the greenhouse experiment, the  tetraploids produced more shoot biomass than the diploids did when grown in a  more fertile substrate, while no inter-cytotype differences were found in a less  fertile substrate. AMF inoculation significantly reduced plant growth and  improved P uptake, but its effects did not differ between the cytotypes.  CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support our hypotheses that the cytotype  structure in a mixed-ploidy population of C. stoebe is mirrored in AMF-community  composition and that ploidy-specific fungal communities contribute to cytotype  co-existence. Causes and implications of the observed negative growth response to  AMF are discussed.","2018-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1995-2007","","12","105","","Am J Bot","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 Botanical Society of America.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30552673","","","","Diploidy; mixed-ploidy population; 454-sequencing; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Centaurea maculosa; Centaurea/*genetics/*microbiology; co-existing cytotypes; Fertilizers; inter-cytotype differences; Mycorrhizae/*growth & development; mycorrhizal symbiosis; ploidy level; spotted knapweed; Tetraploidy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sample  size is especially important in the case of highly heterogeneous disorders such  as schizophrenia, where machine learning models built on relatively low numbers  of subjects may suffer from poor generalizability. Via multicenter studies and  consortium initiatives researchers have tried to solve this problem by combining  data sets from multiple sites. The necessary sharing of (raw) data is, however,  often hindered by legal and ethical issues. Moreover, in the case of very large  samples, the computational complexity might become too large. The solution to  this problem could be distributed learning. In this paper we investigated the  possibility to create a meta-model by combining support vector machines (SVM)  classifiers trained on the local datasets, without the need for sharing medical  images or any other personal data. Validation was done in a 4-center setup  comprising of 480 first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in  total. We built SVM models to separate patients from controls based on three  different kinds of imaging features derived from structural MRI scans, and  compared models built on the joint multicenter data to the meta-models. The  results showed that the combined meta-model had high similarity to the model  built on all data pooled together and comparable classification performance on  all three imaging features. Both similarity and performance was superior to that  of the local models. We conclude that combining models is thus a viable  alternative that facilitates data sharing and creating bigger and more  informative models.","2017-07-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","10-24","","","155","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the heart, all three  MuRF family proteins have proven critical to cardiac responses to ischemia and  heart failure. The non-targeted metabolomics analysis of MuRF1-/-, MuRF2-/-, and  MuRF3-/- hearts was initiated to investigate the hypothesis that MuRF1, MuRF2,  and MuRF3 have a similarly altered metabolome, representing alterations in  overlapping metabolic processes. Ventricular tissue was flash frozen and  quantitatively analyzed by GC/MS using a library built upon the Fiehn GC/MS  Metabolomics RTL Library. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis identified  significant differences (via VIP statistical analysis) in taurine, myoinositol,  and stearic acid for the three MuRF-/- phenotypes relative to their matched  controls. Moreover, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that MuRF1-/- had  significant changes in metabolite(s) involved in taurine metabolism and primary  acid biosynthesis while MuRF2-/- had changes associated with ascorbic  acid/aldarate metabolism (via VIP and t-test analysis vs. sibling-matched  wildtype controls). By identifying the functional metabolic consequences of  MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3 in the intact heart, non-targeted metabolomics analysis  discovered common pathways functionally affected by cardiac MuRF family proteins  in vivo. These novel metabolomics findings will aid in guiding the molecular  studies delineating the mechanisms that MuRF family proteins regulate metabolic  pathways. Understanding these mechanism is an important key to understanding MuRF  family proteins' protective effects on the heart during cardiac disease.","2015-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","312-322","","2","11","","Metabolomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28325996  PMCID: PMC5357560","","","","cardiac; metabolomics; MuRF2; MuRF3; Muscle Ring Finger-1 (MuRF1); ubiquitin ligase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUMMARY OF  BACKGROUND DATA: The bone-anabolic properties of statins in fracture healing are  well established, however, few studies have evaluated the impact of locally  delivered statins in spinal fusion. METHODS: We formulated  poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles by adapting previously  published techniques. Two types of nanoparticles were created: simvastatin  nanoparticles (SimNP) and nanoparticles without simvastatin (BlankNP). Drug  elution from SimNP was characterized. Osteoblastic differentiation was analyzed  using MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in differentiation medium containing SimNP or  BlankNP. Forty male 12 week old outbred Wistar rats underwent uninstrumented  posterolateral fusion using iliac crest bone graft and BlankNP, SimNP or  simvastatin drug. X-rays to assess bone formation were obtained at 4 weeks and 9  weeks post-operatively. Spines were explanted at 9 weeks for micro-CT analysis,  and a blinded manual assessment of fusion (MAF). RESULTS: SimNP achieved a  release efficiency of 74.1% with ∼50% release occurring in the first day.  Simvastatin and SimNP treated cells showed significantly greater expression of  osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN). On micro-CT analysis, SimNP animals had  higher bone volume and percent bone volume (bone volume/total volume) than  control animals. SimNP rats had higher X-ray scores at 4 weeks (p=0.010) and 9  weeks (p<0.001) relative to BlankNP. MAF showed that SimNP had a higher fusion  rate than BlankNP (42.9% vs. 0%, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: We were able to validate  that sustained release of simvastatin via a PLGA nanoparticle. SimNP was able to  induce an increase in mineralization as well as an increase in markers of bone  formation. X-ray analysis, micro-CT quantification, and MAF assessment of SimNP  treated rats showed significantly greater bone formation and fusion mass strength  relative to vehicle treated animals. Simvastatin may be a safe, cost-effective  bone anabolic agent for use in spinal fusion.

Widespread heterogeneity of results from studies  published to date preclude any definitive characterization of the relationship  between white matter and cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Given the  relevance of deficits in cognitive function to predicting social and functional  outcomes in schizophrenia, the authors carried out a meta-analysis of available  data through the ENIGMA Consortium, using a common analysis pipeline, to  elucidate the relationship between white matter microstructure and a measure of  general cognitive performance, IQ, in patients with schizophrenia and healthy  participants. METHODS: The meta-analysis included 760 patients with schizophrenia  and 957 healthy participants from 11 participating ENIGMA Consortium sites. For  each site, principal component analysis was used to calculate both a global  fractional anisotropy component (gFA) and a fractional anisotropy component for  six long association tracts (LA-gFA) previously associated with cognition.  RESULTS: Meta-analyses of regression results indicated that gFA accounted for a  significant amount of variation in cognition in the full sample (effect size  [Hedges' g]=0.27, CI=0.17-0.36), with similar effects sizes observed for both the  patient (effect size=0.20, CI=0.05-0.35) and healthy participant groups (effect  size=0.32, CI=0.18-0.45). Comparable patterns of association were also observed  between LA-gFA and cognition for the full sample (effect size=0.28,  CI=0.18-0.37), the patient group (effect size=0.23, CI=0.09-0.38), and the  healthy participant group (effect size=0.31, CI=0.18-0.44). CONCLUSIONS: This  study provides robust evidence that cognitive ability is associated with global  structural connectivity, with higher fractional anisotropy associated with higher  IQ. This association was independent of diagnosis; while schizophrenia patients  tended to have lower fractional anisotropy and lower IQ than healthy  participants, the comparable size of effect in each group suggested a more  general, rather than disease-specific, pattern of association.","2020-06-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","537-547","","6","177","","Am J Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32212855  PMCID: PMC7938666","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Case-Control Studies; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Principal Component Analysis; *Schizophrenic Psychology; Adult; Middle Aged; Schizophrenia; Cognition; Anisotropy; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; *Intelligence; Cognition/*physiology; ENIGMA; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Healthy Volunteers; Intelligence; Meta-Analysis; Neural Pathways/diagnostic imaging; Schizophrenia/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Wechsler Scales; White Matter; White Matter/*diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies employ resting state functional magnetic  resonance imaging techniques to assess the stationary effects of cannabis and  to-date one report addressed the impact of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on the  dynamics of whole-brain functional connectivity. METHODS: Using a  repeated-measures, within-subjects design, 19 healthy occasional cannabis users  (smoking cannabis ⩽2 per week) underwent resting state functional magnetic  resonance imaging scans. Each subject underwent two scans: in the intoxicated  condition, shortly after smoking a cannabis cigarette, and in the non-intoxicated  condition, with the subject being free from cannabinoids for at least one week  before. All sessions were randomized and performed in a four-week interval. Data  were analysed employing a standard independent component analysis approach with  subsequent tracking of the functional connectivity dynamics, which allowed six  connectivity clusters (states) to be individuated. RESULTS: Using standard  independent component analysis in resting state functional connectivity, a group  effect was found in the precuneus connectivity. With a dynamic independent  component analysis approach, we identified one transient connectivity state,  characterized by high connectivity within and between auditory and somato-motor  cortices and anti-correlation with subcortical structures and the cerebellum that  was only found during the intoxicated condition. Behavioural measures of the  subjective experiences of changed perceptions and tetrahydrocannabinol plasma  levels during intoxication were associated with this state. CONCLUSIONS: With the  help of the dynamic connectivity approach we could elucidate neural correlates of  the transitory perceptual changes induced by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in  cannabis users, and possibly identify a biomarker of cannabis intoxication.","2019-07","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","811-821","","7","33","","J Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31154891","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adult; Young Adult; altered states of consciousness; Brain/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects; Cannabis; Dronabinol/*pharmacology; dynamic functional connectivity; Hallucinogens/*pharmacology; Marijuana Smoking/*psychology; resting state networks; tetrahydrocannabinol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  analyzed sixteen iGluR genes in full length to determine the sequence variability  of iGluR genes. Our aim was to describe the rate of genetic variability, its  distribution, and the co-occurrence of variants and to identify new candidate  risk variants or haplotypes. The cumulative effect of genetic risk was then  estimated using a simple scoring model. GRIN2A-B, GRIN3A-B, and GRIK4 genes  showed significantly increased genetic variation in SCH patients. The fixation  index statistic revealed eight intronic haplotypes and an additional four  intronic SNPs within the sequences of iGluR genes associated with SCH (p < 0.05).  The haplotypes were used in the proposed simple scoring model and moreover as a  test for genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. The positive likelihood ratio  for the scoring model test reached 7.11. We also observed 41 protein-altering  variants (38 missense variants, four frameshifts, and one nonsense variant) that  were not significantly associated with SCH. Our data suggest that some intronic  regulatory regions of iGluR genes and their common variability are among the  components from which the genetic predisposition to SCH is composed.","2021-11-25","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","","","12","11","","J Pers Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 34945722  PMCID: PMC8708351","","","","schizophrenia; BrainAGE; genetic variations; haplotypes; intron; ionotropic glutamate receptor; scoring model; SNP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While MuRF1 has been  reported to interact with mitochondrial substrates in yeast two-hybrid studies,  no studies have identified MuRF1's role in regulating mitochondrial function to  date. In the present study, we measured cardiac mitochondrial function from  isolated permeabilized muscle fibers in previously phenotyped MuRF1 transgenic  and MuRF1-/- mouse models to determine the role of MuRF1 in intermediate energy  metabolism and ROS production. We identified a significant decrease in reactive  oxygen species production in cardiac muscle fibers from MuRF1 transgenic mice  with increased α-MHC driven MuRF1 expression. Increased MuRF1 expression in ex  vivo and in vitro experiments revealed no alterations in the respiratory chain  complex I and II function. Working perfusion experiments on MuRF1 transgenic  hearts demonstrated significant changes in glucose oxidation. However, total  oxygen consumption was decreased [corrected]. This data provides evidence for  MuRF1 as a novel regulator of cardiac ROS, offering another mechanism by which  increased MuRF1 expression may be cardioprotective in ischemia reperfusion  injury, in addition to its inhibition of apoptosis via proteasome-mediate  degradation of c-Jun. The lack of mitochondrial function phenotype identified in  MuRF1-/- hearts may be due to the overlapping interactions of MuRF1 and MuRF2  with energy regulating proteins found by yeast two-hybrid studies reported here,  implying a duplicity in MuRF1 and MuRF2's regulation of mitochondrial function.","2014-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","173-187","","3","46","","J Bioenerg Biomembr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24733503  PMCID: PMC4047114","","","","Animals; Mice; Cells, Cultured; Citric Acid Cycle/*physiology; Energy Metabolism/*physiology; Enzyme Activation; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondria, Heart/*metabolism; Muscle Proteins/*metabolism; Oxygen Consumption/*physiology; Oxygen/*metabolism; Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism; Tripartite Motif Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The translation  and decay of mRNAs are closely linked, competing processes, and whether the  miRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) acts primarily to reduce translation or  stability of the mRNA remains controversial. miR-122 is an abundant,  liver-specific miRNA that is an unusual host factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV),  an important cause of liver disease in humans. Prior studies show that it binds  the 5' UTR of the messenger-sense HCV RNA genome, stimulating translation and  promoting genome replication by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that miR-122  binds HCV RNA in association with Ago2 and that this slows decay of the viral  genome in infected cells. The stabilizing action of miR-122 does not require the  viral RNA to be translationally active nor engaged in replication, and can be  functionally substituted by a nonmethylated 5' cap. Our data demonstrate that a  RISC-like complex mediates the stability of HCV RNA and suggest that Ago2 and  miR-122 act coordinately to protect the viral genome from 5' exonuclease activity  of the host mRNA decay machinery. miR-122 thus acts in an unconventional fashion  to stabilize HCV RNA and slow its decay, expanding the repertoire of mechanisms  by which miRNAs modulate gene expression.","2012-01-17","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","941-946","","3","109","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22215596  PMCID: PMC3271899","","","","Humans; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Methylation; MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism; *RNA Stability; 5' Untranslated Regions/genetics; Argonaute Proteins/*metabolism; Genome, Viral/genetics; HeLa Cells; Hepacivirus/*genetics; Protein Binding; RNA Caps/metabolism; RNA, Viral/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The within-subject  tendency to experience illness episodes in the same season, that is, seasonal  course, is much less established, as certain individuals may temporarily meet  criteria for seasonal course purely by chance. AIMS: In this population,  prospective cohort study, we investigated whether between and within-subject  seasonal patterns of hospitalizations occurred more frequently than would be  expected by chance. METHODS: Using a compulsory, standardized national register  of hospitalizations, we analyzed all admissions for mood disorders and  schizophrenia in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2013. We used bootstrap  tests to compare the observed numbers of (a) participants with seasonal/regular  course and (b) hospitalizations in individual months against empirical  distributions obtained by simulations. RESULTS: Among 87 184 participants, we  found uneven distribution of hospitalizations, with hospitalization peaks for  depression in April and November (X(2) (11) = 363.66, P < .001), for mania in  August (X(2) (11) = 50.36, P < .001) and for schizophrenia in June (X(2)  (11) = 70.34, P < .001).

The proportion of participants with two consecutive  hospitalizations in the same season was below chance level (7.06%). CONCLUSIONS:  Psychiatric hospitalizations were unevenly distributed throughout the year  (cross-sectional seasonality), with evidence for regularity, but not seasonality  of hospitalizations within subjects.

In this longitudinal study in first episode of psychosis (FEP), we  used machine learning and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study  the impact of psychotic illness and obesity on brain ageing/neuroprogression  shortly after illness onset. METHODS: We acquired 2 prospective MRI scans on  average 1.61 years apart in 183 FEP and 155 control individuals. We used a  machine learning model trained on an independent sample of 504 controls to  estimate the individual brain ages of study participants and calculated BrainAGE  by subtracting chronological from the estimated brain age. RESULTS: Individuals  with FEP had a higher initial BrainAGE than controls (3.39 ± 6.36 vs 1.72 ± 5.56  years; β = 1.68, t(336) = 2.59, P = .01), but similar annual rates of brain  ageing over time (1.28 ± 2.40 vs 1.07±1.74 estimated years/actual year; t(333) =  0.93, P = .18). Across both cohorts, greater baseline body mass index (BMI)  predicted faster brain ageing (β = 0.08, t(333) = 2.59, P = .01). For each  additional BMI point, the brain aged by an additional month per year. Worsening  of functioning over time (Global Assessment of Functioning; β = -0.04, t(164) =  -2.48, P = .01) and increases especially in negative symptoms on the Positive and  Negative Syndrome Scale (β = 0.11, t(175) = 3.11, P = .002) were associated with  faster brain ageing in FEP. CONCLUSIONS: Brain alterations in psychosis are  manifest already during the first episode and over time get worse in those with  worsening clinical outcomes or higher baseline BMI. As baseline BMI predicted  faster brain ageing, obesity may represent a modifiable risk factor in FEP that  is linked with psychiatric outcomes via effects on brain structure.","2021-10-21","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1772-1781","","6","47","","Schizophr Bull","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2021.

Unlike classical between-group comparisons, machine learning can  identify subtle disease patterns on a single subject level, which could help  realize the potential of MRI in establishing a psychiatric diagnosis. Machine  learning has previously been predominantly tested on gray-matter structural or  functional MRI data. In this paper we used a machine learning classifier to  differentiate patients with a first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder  (FES) from healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: We applied  linear support-vector machine (SVM) and traditional tract based spatial  statistics between group analyses to brain fractional anisotropy (FA) data from  77 FES and 77 age and sex matched healthy controls. We also evaluated the effects  of medication and symptoms on the SVM classification. RESULTS: The SVM  distinguished between patients and controls with significant accuracy of 62.34%  (p = 0.005). Participants with FES showed widespread FA reductions relative to  controls in a large cluster (N  = 56,647 voxels, corrected p = 0.002). The white  matter regions, which contributed to the correct identification of participants  with FES, overlapped with the regions, which showed lower FA in patients relative  to controls. There was no association between the classification performance and  medication or symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a proof of concept that  SVM might help differentiate FES patients early in the course of illness from  healthy controls using white-matter fractional anisotropy.

Despite the fact that visuospatial deficit was  reported in schizophrenia, research on visuospatial functions as an independent  entity is limited. Our study aims to elucidate the impact of visuospatial deficit  in comparison with verbal deficit on global functioning and quality of life in  the first psychotic episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (FES). The  significance of clinical symptoms and antipsychotic medication was also studied.  METHODS: Thirty-six FES patients and a matched group of healthy controls (HC  group) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery focused on visuospatial  (VIS) and verbal (VERB) functions. Using multiple regression analysis, we  evaluated the cumulative effect of VERB and VIS functions, psychiatric symptoms  (PANSS) and antipsychotic medication on global functioning (GAF) and quality of  life (WHOQOL-BREF) in the FES group. RESULTS: The FES group demonstrated  significant impairment both in VIS and VERB cognitive abilities compared to the  HC group. Antipsychotic medication did not significantly affect either VIS or  VERB functioning. PANSS was not related to cognitive functioning, apart from the  Trail Making Test B. In the FES group, the GAF score was significantly affected  by the severity of positive symptoms and VERB functioning, explaining together  60% of GAF variability. The severity of negative and positive symptoms affected  only the Physical health domain of WHOQOL-BREF. The degree of VERB deficit was  associated with both Physical and Psychological health. Although we did not find  any relation between VIS functioning, GAF, and WHOQOL-BREF, a paradoxical finding  emerged in the Environment quality domain, where a worse quality of the  environment was associated with better VIS functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  suggest that the deficit in VIS functions is an integral part of cognitive  deficit in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, rather than a side effect of  symptomatology or antipsychotic medication. Moreover, VERB functioning was a  better predictor of GAF and WHOQOL-BREF than VIS functioning. Given the findings  of negative or missing effect of VIS deficit on WHOQOL-BREF and GAF, the accuracy  of these measures in evaluating the impact of global cognitive deficit on  everyday life in schizophrenia could be questioned.","2015","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","322","","","9","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 26733828  PMCID: PMC4683173","","","","quality of life; antipsychotic medication; cognitive deficit; first psychotic episode; global functioning; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; verbal functions; visuospatial functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we  studied Alyssum repens, a member of the polyploid species complex A. montanum-A.  repens, which exhibits SE Alpine-Carpathian disjunctions with a large elevational  span and consists of diploid and tetraploid populations. We aimed to investigate  the species' genetic and cytotype structure in the context of its distribution  patterns, to elucidate the polyploid origins and to propose an appropriate  taxonomic treatment. METHODS: We combined AFLP fingerprinting markers, sequence  variation of the highly repetitive ITS region of rDNA and the low-copy DET1  nuclear gene, genome size, and morphometric data. RESULTS: We identified four  geographically structured genetic lineages. One consisted of diploid populations  from the foothills of the Southeastern Alps and neighboring regions, and the  three others were allopatric montane to alpine groups comprising diploids and  tetraploids growing in the Southeastern Carpathians and the Apuseni Mts. in  Romania. CONCLUSIONS: We inferred a vicariance scenario associated with  Quaternary climatic oscillations, accompanied by one auto- and two  allopolyploidization events most likely involving a northern Balkan relative.  Whereas genetic differentiation and allopatric distribution would favor the  taxonomic splitting of this species, the genetic lineages largely lack  morphological distinguishability, and their ecological, cytotype and genome size  divergence is only partial. Even though we probably face here a case of incipient  speciation, we propose to maintain the current taxonomic treatment of Alyssum  repens as a single, albeit variable, species.","2019-11","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1499-1518","","11","106","","Am J Bot","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 Botanical Society of America.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31639199","","","","Humans; Genetic Variation; Phylogeny; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Phylogeography; allopolyploidy; Brassicaceae; morphometrics; *Diploidy; *Polyploidy; AFLPs; genome size; glacial refugia; integrative taxonomy; low-copy nuclear genes; nrDNA ITS; vicariance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous machine learning applications suggest that  individual classification is feasible and reliable and, however, is focused on  the predictive performance of the clinical status in cross-sectional designs,  which has limited biological perspectives. Moreover, most studies depend on  relatively small cohorts or single recruiting site. Finally, no study controlled  for disease stage or medication's effect. These elements cast doubt on previous  findings' reproducibility. METHOD: We propose a machine learning algorithm that  provides an interpretable brain signature. Using large datasets collected from 4  sites (276 schizophrenia patients, 330 controls), we assessed cross-site  prediction reproducibility and associated predictive signature. For the first  time, we evaluated the predictive signature regarding medication and illness  duration using an independent dataset of first-episode patients. RESULTS: Machine  learning classifiers based on neuroanatomical features yield significant  intersite prediction accuracies (72%) together with an excellent predictive  signature stability. This signature provides a neural score significantly  correlated with symptom severity and the extent of cognitive impairments.  Moreover, this signature demonstrates its efficiency on first-episode psychosis  patients (73% accuracy).

Despite  the high burden of metabolic disorders, little is known about their effects on  brain structure in psychosis. We investigated, whether obesity or dyslipidemia  contributed to brain alterations in first-episode psychosis (FEP). METHODS: 120  participants with FEP, who were undergoing their first psychiatric  hospitalization, had <24 months of untreated psychosis and were 18-35 years old  and 114 controls within the same age range participated in the study. We acquired  3T brain structural MRI, fasting lipids and body mass index. We used machine  learning trained on an independent sample of 504 controls to estimate the  individual brain age of study participants and calculated the BrainAGE score by  subtracting the chronological from the estimated brain age. RESULTS: In a  multiple regression model, the diagnosis of FEP (B = 1.15, SE B = 0.31,  p < 0.001) and obesity/overweight (B = 0.92, SE B = 0.35, p = 0.008) were each  additively associated with BrainAGE scores (R(2) = 0.22, F(3, 230) = 21.92,  p < 0.001). BrainAGE scores were highest in participants with FEP and  obesity/overweight (3.83 years, 95%CI = 2.35-5.31) and lowest in normal weight  controls (-0.27 years, 95%CI = -1.22-0.69). LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol or  triglycerides were not associated with BrainAGE scores. CONCLUSIONS:  Overweight/obesity may be an independent risk factor for diffuse brain  alterations manifesting as advanced brain age already early in the course of  psychosis. These findings raise the possibility that targeting metabolic health  and intervening already at the level of overweight/obesity could slow brain  ageing in FEP.","2018-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","151-158","","","99","","J Psychiatr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018.

Some studies examined  cortical thickness, but most of them have used parcellation approaches with data  from single sites, which limits claims of generalizability. To address these  limitations, we conducted a large-scale, multi-site analysis of cortical  thickness comparing parcellations and vertex-wise approaches. By leveraging the  multi-site nature of the study, we further investigated how different  demographical and site-dependent variables affected predictions. Finally, we  assessed relationships between predictions and clinical variables. 428 subjects  (147 females, mean age 27.14) with FEP and 448 (230 females, mean age 27.06)  healthy controls were enrolled in 8 centers by the ClassiFEP group. All subjects  underwent a structural MRI and were clinically assessed. Cortical thickness  parcellation (68 areas) and full cortical maps (20,484 vertices) were extracted.  Linear Support Vector Machine was used for classification within a repeated  nested cross-validation framework. Vertex-wise thickness maps outperformed  parcellation-based methods with a balanced accuracy of 66.2% and an Area Under  the Curve of 72%. By stratifying our sample for MRI scanner, we increased  generalizability across sites. Temporal brain areas resulted as the most  influential in the classification. The predictive decision scores significantly  correlated with age at onset, duration of treatment, and positive symptoms. In  conclusion, although far from the threshold of clinical relevance, temporal  cortical thickness proved to classify between FEP subjects and healthy  individuals. The assessment of site-dependent variables permitted an increase in  the across-site generalizability, thus attempting to address an important machine  learning limitation.","2021-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","34-47","","","47","","Eur Neuropsychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

RESULTS: The results suggest that  with progression stages, there are changing correlations among Positive and  Negative Syndrome Scale factors at each stage and each factor correlates with all  the others in that particular stage, in which this factor is dominant. This  internal structure further supports the validity of an already proposed four  stages model, with positive symptoms dominating the first stage,  excitement/hostility the second, depression the third, and neurocognitive decline  the last stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current study investigated the mental  organization and functioning in patients with schizophrenia in relation to  different stages of illness progression. It revealed two distinct ""cores"" of  schizophrenia, the ""Positive"" and the ""Negative,"" while neurocognitive decline  escalates during the later stages. Future research should focus on the  therapeutic implications of such a model. Stopping the progress of the illness  could demand to stop the succession of stages. This could be achieved not only by  both halting the triggering effect of positive and negative symptoms, but also by  stopping the sensitization effect on the neural pathways responsible for the  development of hostility, excitement, anxiety, and depression as well as the  deleterious effect on neural networks responsible for neurocognition.","2021-06","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","290-298","","3","26","","CNS Spectr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32290897","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Disease Progression; *Schizophrenic Psychology; Adult; Middle Aged; Schizophrenia; Adolescent; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; outcome; staging; long-term course; model; Schizophrenia/*diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  Twenty-nine centers from 25 countries representing all continents participated in  the study that included 2358 patients aged 37.21 ± 11.87 years with a DSM-IV or  DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia; the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale as  well as relevant clinicodemographic data were gathered. Analysis of variance and  analysis of covariance were used, and the methodology corrected for the presence  of potentially confounding effects. RESULTS: There was a 3-year later age at  onset for females (P < .001) and lower rates of negative symptoms (P < .01) and  higher depression/anxiety measures (P < .05) at some stages. The age at onset  manifested a distribution with a single peak for both genders with a tendency of  patients with younger onset having slower advancement through illness stages  (P = .001). No significant effects were found concerning duration of illness.  DISCUSSION: Our results confirmed a later onset and a possibly more benign course  and outcome in females. Age at onset manifested a single peak in both genders,  and surprisingly, earlier onset was related to a slower progression of the  illness. No effect of duration has been detected. These results are partially in  accord with the literature, but they also differ as a consequence of the  different starting point of our methodology (a novel staging model), which in our  opinion precluded the impact of confounding effects. Future research should focus  on the therapeutic policy and implications of these results in more  representative samples.","2022-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","716-723","","6","27","","CNS Spectr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34369340","","","","Humans; Female; Male; schizophrenia; outcome; long-term course; *Schizophrenia/diagnosis/epidemiology; age at onset; Age of Onset; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; duration; Gender","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, we do not understand how the brain correlates  of obesity map onto the brain changes in schizophrenia. We obtained MRI-derived  brain cortical and subcortical measures and body mass index (BMI) from 1260  individuals with schizophrenia and 1761 controls from 12 independent research  sites within the ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group. We jointly modeled the  statistical effects of schizophrenia and BMI using mixed effects. BMI was  additively associated with structure of many of the same brain regions as  schizophrenia, but the cortical and subcortical alterations in schizophrenia were  more widespread and pronounced. Both BMI and schizophrenia were primarily  associated with changes in cortical thickness, with fewer correlates in surface  area. While, BMI was negatively associated with cortical thickness, the  significant associations between BMI and surface area or subcortical volumes were  positive. Lastly, the brain correlates of obesity were replicated among large  studies and closely resembled neurostructural changes in major depressive  disorders. We confirmed widespread associations between BMI and brain structure  in individuals with schizophrenia. People with both obesity and schizophrenia  showed more pronounced brain alterations than people with only one of these  conditions. Obesity appears to be a relevant factor which could account for  heterogeneity of brain imaging findings and for differences in brain imaging  outcomes among people with schizophrenia.","2022-09","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","3731-3737","","9","27","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

METHODS:  We combined data from ten prospective, first-episode psychosis cohorts from  across Europe and categorised patients as TR or non-treatment resistant (NTR)  after a mean follow up of 4.18 years (s.d. = 3.20) for secondary data analysis.  We identified a list of potential predictors from clinical and demographic data  recorded at first-episode. These potential predictors were entered in two models:  a multivariable logistic regression to identify which were independently  associated with TR and a penalised logistic regression, which performed variable  selection, to produce a parsimonious prediction model. This model was internally  validated using a 5-fold, 50-repeat cross-validation optimism-correction.  RESULTS: Our sample consisted of N = 2216 participants of which 385 (17 %)  developed TR. Younger age of psychosis onset and fewer years in education were  independently associated with increased odds of developing TR. The prediction  model selected 7 out of 17 variables that, when combined, could quantify the risk  of being TR better than chance. These included age of onset, years in education,  gender, BMI, relationship status, alcohol use, and positive symptoms. The  optimism-corrected area under the curve was 0.59 (accuracy = 64 %,  sensitivity = 48 %, and specificity = 76 %). IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that  treatment resistance can be predicted, at first-episode of psychosis. Pending a  model update and external validation, we demonstrate the potential value of  prediction models for TR.","2022-12","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1-9","","","250","","Schizophr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

In an effort to identify commonalities across studies, we  perform what we believe is the first ever large-scale coordinated study of WM  microstructural differences in schizophrenia. Our analysis consisted of 2359  healthy controls and 1963 schizophrenia patients from 29 independent  international studies; we harmonized the processing and statistical analyses of  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data across sites and meta-analyzed effects across  studies. Significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) in schizophrenia  patients were widespread, and detected in 20 of 25 regions of interest within a  WM skeleton representing all major WM fasciculi. Effect sizes varied by region,  peaking at (d=0.42) for the entire WM skeleton, driven more by peripheral areas  as opposed to the core WM where regions of interest were defined. The anterior  corona radiata (d=0.40) and corpus callosum (d=0.39), specifically its body  (d=0.39) and genu (d=0.37), showed greatest effects. Significant decreases, to  lesser degrees, were observed in almost all regions analyzed. Larger effect sizes  were observed for FA than diffusivity measures; significantly higher mean and  radial diffusivity was observed for schizophrenia patients compared with  controls. No significant effects of age at onset of schizophrenia or medication  dosage were detected. As the largest coordinated analysis of WM differences in a  psychiatric disorder to date, the present study provides a robust profile of  widespread WM abnormalities in schizophrenia patients worldwide.

We  investigated evidence for advanced brain ageing in adult SZ patients, and whether  this was associated with clinical characteristics in a prospective meta-analytic  study conducted by the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group. The study included  data from 26 cohorts worldwide, with a total of 2803 SZ patients (mean age 34.2  years; range 18-72 years; 67% male) and 2598 healthy controls (mean age 33.8  years, range 18-73 years, 55% male). Brain-predicted age was individually  estimated using a model trained on independent data based on 68 measures of  cortical thickness and surface area, 7 subcortical volumes, lateral ventricular  volumes and total intracranial volume, all derived from T1-weighted brain  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Deviations from a healthy brain ageing  trajectory were assessed by the difference between brain-predicted age and  chronological age (brain-predicted age difference [brain-PAD]). On average, SZ  patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +3.55 years (95% CI: 2.91, 4.19;  I(2) = 57.53%) compared to controls, after adjusting for age, sex and site  (Cohen's d = 0.48). Among SZ patients, brain-PAD was not associated with specific  clinical characteristics (age of onset, duration of illness, symptom severity, or  antipsychotic use and dose). This large-scale collaborative study suggests  advanced structural brain ageing in SZ. Longitudinal studies of SZ and a range of  mental and somatic health outcomes will help to further evaluate the clinical  implications of increased brain-PAD and its ability to be influenced by  interventions.","2023-03","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","1201-1209","","3","28","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Deviations in the tangential growth of the cerebral cortex during pre/perinatal  periods may be reflected in individual variations in cortical surface area later  in life. METHODS: Interregional profiles of group differences in surface area  between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance  imaging from 27,359 individuals including those with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar  disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and high general  psychopathology (through the Child Behavior Checklist). Similarity of  interregional profiles of group differences in surface area and prenatal  cell-specific gene expression was assessed. RESULTS: Across the 11 cortical  regions, group differences in cortical area for attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder, schizophrenia, and Child Behavior Checklist were dominant in multimodal  association cortices. The same interregional profiles were also associated with  interregional profiles of (prenatal) gene expression specific to proliferative  cells, namely radial glia and intermediate progenitor cells (greater expression,  larger difference), as well as differentiated cells, namely excitatory neurons  and endothelial and mural cells (greater expression, smaller difference).  Finally, these cell types were implicated in known pre/perinatal risk factors for  psychosis. Genes coexpressed with radial glia were enriched with genes implicated  in congenital abnormalities, birth weight, hypoxia, and starvation. Genes  coexpressed with endothelial and mural genes were enriched with genes associated  with maternal hypertension and preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a  neurodevelopmental model of vulnerability to mental illness whereby prenatal risk  factors acting through cell-specific processes lead to deviations from typical  brain development during pregnancy.","2022-08-15","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","299-313","","4","92","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

This  clinical presentation, chronic and highly disabling, is known as  treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The causes of treatment resistance and  their relationships with causes underlying schizophrenia are largely unknown.  Adequately powered genetic studies of TRS are scarce because of the difficulty in  collecting data from well-characterized TRS cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the  genetic architecture of TRS through the reassessment of genetic data from  schizophrenia studies and its validation in carefully ascertained clinical  samples. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two case-control genome-wide  association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia were performed in which the case  samples were defined as individuals with TRS (n = 10 501) and individuals with  non-TRS (n = 20 325). The differences in effect sizes for allelic associations  were then determined between both studies, the reasoning being such differences  reflect treatment resistance instead of schizophrenia. Genotype data were  retrieved from the CLOZUK and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia  studies. The output was validated using polygenic risk score (PRS) profiling of 2  independent schizophrenia cohorts with TRS and non-TRS: a prevalence sample with  817 individuals (Cardiff Cognition in Schizophrenia [CardiffCOGS]) and an  incidence sample with 563 individuals (Genetics Workstream of the Schizophrenia  Treatment Resistance and Therapeutic Advances [STRATA-G]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND  MEASURES: GWAS of treatment resistance in schizophrenia. The results of the GWAS  were compared with complex polygenic traits through a genetic correlation  approach and were used for PRS analysis on the independent validation cohorts  using the same TRS definition. RESULTS: The study included a total of 85 490  participants (48 635 [56.9%] male) in its GWAS stage and 1380 participants (859  [62.2%] male) in its PRS validation stage. Treatment resistance in schizophrenia  emerged as a polygenic trait with detectable heritability (1% to 4%), and several  traits related to intelligence and cognition were found to be genetically  correlated with it (genetic correlation, 0.41-0.69). PRS analysis in the  CardiffCOGS prevalence sample showed a positive association between TRS and a  history of taking clozapine (r2 = 2.03%; P = .001), which was replicated in the  STRATA-G incidence sample (r2 = 1.09%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In  this GWAS, common genetic variants were differentially associated with TRS, and  these associations may have been obscured through the amalgamation of large GWAS  samples in previous studies of broadly defined schizophrenia. Findings of this  study suggest the validity of meta-analytic approaches for studies on patient  outcomes, including treatment resistance.","2022-03-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","260-269","","3","79","","JAMA Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35019943  PMCID: PMC8756361","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Genome-Wide Association Study; *Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy; *Schizophrenia/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Multifactorial Inheritance/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We carried  out the largest case-control study of structural brain asymmetries in  schizophrenia, with MRI data from 5,080 affected individuals and 6,015 controls  across 46 datasets, using a single image analysis protocol. Asymmetry indexes  were calculated for global and regional cortical thickness, surface area, and  subcortical volume measures. Differences of asymmetry were calculated between  affected individuals and controls per dataset, and effect sizes were  meta-analyzed across datasets. Small average case-control differences were  observed for thickness asymmetries of the rostral anterior cingulate and the  middle temporal gyrus, both driven by thinner left-hemispheric cortices in  schizophrenia. Analyses of these asymmetries with respect to the use of  antipsychotic medication and other clinical variables did not show any  significant associations. Assessment of age- and sex-specific effects revealed a  stronger average leftward asymmetry of pallidum volume between older cases and  controls. Case-control differences in a multivariate context were assessed in a  subset of the data (N = 2,029), which revealed that 7% of the variance across all  structural asymmetries was explained by case-control status. Subtle case-control  differences of brain macrostructural asymmetry may reflect differences at the  molecular, cytoarchitectonic, or circuit levels that have functional relevance  for the disorder. Reduced left middle temporal cortical thickness is consistent  with altered left-hemisphere language network organization in schizophrenia.","2023-04-04","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","e2213880120","","14","120","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36976765  PMCID: PMC10083554","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Case-Control Studies; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Functional Laterality; Schizophrenia; Cerebral Cortex; *Schizophrenia/diagnostic imaging; asymmetry; brain imaging; cortical; subcortical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents the first meta-analysis of cortical  thickness and surface area abnormalities in schizophrenia conducted by the ENIGMA  (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Schizophrenia Working  Group. METHODS: The study included data from 4474 individuals with schizophrenia  (mean age, 32.3 years; range, 11-78 years; 66% male) and 5098 healthy volunteers  (mean age, 32.8 years; range, 10-87 years; 53% male) assessed with standardized  methods at 39 centers worldwide. RESULTS: Compared with healthy volunteers,  individuals with schizophrenia have widespread thinner cortex (left/right  hemisphere: Cohen's d = -0.530/-0.516) and smaller surface area (left/right  hemisphere: Cohen's d = -0.251/-0.254), with the largest effect sizes for both in  frontal and temporal lobe regions. Regional group differences in cortical  thickness remained significant when statistically controlling for global cortical  thickness, suggesting regional specificity. In contrast, effects for cortical  surface area appear global. Case-control, negative, cortical thickness effect  sizes were two to three times larger in individuals receiving antipsychotic  medication relative to unmedicated individuals. Negative correlations between age  and bilateral temporal pole thickness were stronger in individuals with  schizophrenia than in healthy volunteers. Regional cortical thickness showed  significant negative correlations with normalized medication dose, symptom  severity, and duration of illness and positive correlations with age at onset.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the ENIGMA meta-analysis approach can  achieve robust findings in clinical neuroscience studies; also, medication  effects should be taken into account in future genetic association studies of  cortical thickness in schizophrenia.","2018-11-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","644-654","","9","84","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

The underlying neurobiology  behind these differences is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine  neurobiologic correlates of group differences in cortical thickness between cases  and controls in 6 disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder  (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING,  AND PARTICIPANTS: Profiles of group differences in cortical thickness between  cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images.  Similarity between interregional profiles of cell-specific gene expression and  those in the group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each  disorder. Next, principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile  of group difference in thickness across the disorders. Analysis for gene  coexpression, clustering, and enrichment for genes associated with these  disorders were conducted. Data analysis was conducted between June and December  2019. The analysis included 145 cohorts across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from  the ENIGMA consortium. The numbers of cases and controls in each of the 6  disorders were as follows: ADHD: 1814 and 1602; ASD: 1748 and 1770; BD: 1547 and  3405; MDD: 2658 and 3572; OCD: 2266 and 2007; and schizophrenia: 2688 and 3244.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interregional profiles of group difference in  cortical thickness between cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 12 721 cases  and 15 600 controls, ranging from ages 2 to 89 years, were included in this  study. Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for each  of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression  specific to pyramidal (CA1) cells, astrocytes (except for BD), and microglia  (except for OCD); collectively, gene-expression profiles of the 3 cell types  explain between 25% and 54% of variance in interregional profiles of group  differences in cortical thickness. Principal component analysis revealed a shared  profile of difference in cortical thickness across the 6 disorders (48% variance  explained); interregional profile of this principal component 1 was associated  with that of the pyramidal-cell gene expression (explaining 56% of interregional  variation). Coexpression analyses of these genes revealed 2 clusters: (1) a  prenatal cluster enriched with genes involved in neurodevelopmental (axon  guidance) processes and (2) a postnatal cluster enriched with genes involved in  synaptic activity and plasticity-related processes. These clusters were enriched  with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: In this study, shared neurobiologic processes were associated with  differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric disorders. These  processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and postnatal  functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders.","2021-01-01","2023-04-21 14:11:38","2023-04-21 14:11:38","","47-63","","1","78","","JAMA Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32857118  PMCID: PMC7450410","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Child, Preschool; Case-Control Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cohort Studies; Principal Component Analysis; Adult; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Young Adult; Aged; Child; Aged, 80 and over; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Autism Spectrum Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Cerebral Cortex/cytology/diagnostic imaging/growth & development/*pathology; Computational Biology; Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Fetal Development/*physiology; Gene Expression/*physiology; Human Development/*physiology; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Schizophrenia/diagnostic imaging/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
