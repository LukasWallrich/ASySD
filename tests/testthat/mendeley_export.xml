OBJECTIVES: The presence, age of onset, characteristics and treatment of myoclonic episodes were retrospectively evaluated in a cohort of CKCS which presented to 1 board-certified neurologist. Clinical data, imaging studies, presence of seizures and their management, as well as other comorbidities were noted. ANIMALS: Thirty-nine CKCS that were presented to 2 institutions between 2001 and 2018 with signs consistent with myoclonus. Clinical examination, blood sampling, advanced diagnostic imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and record keeping of other comorbidities was performed. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series, describing the presence of myoclonus in CKCS. RESULTS: Clinical signs reported were spontaneous in onset, lasted a few seconds and consisted of rapid blinking with head nodding and variable extension down the thoracic limbs. Myoclonus occasionally led to stumbling of the thoracic limbs or collapse. Mean age of onset was 8.38 years (SD ±1.96). Thirteen of 39 dogs with myoclonus had paroxysmal events, such as generalized seizures (9/13). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Myoclonus occurs in middle-aged to older CKCS and seems to be another epiphenomena of this breed. A link to epilepsy might be present.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Lynette K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary secretory otitis media in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary clinics of North America.

A large, bulging pars flaccida identified on otoscopic examination confirms the diagnosis. However, in many CKCS with PSOM the pars flaccida is flat, and radiographic imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Current treatment for PSOM includes performing a myringotomy into the caudal-ventral quadrant of the pars tensa with subsequent flushing of the mucus out of the bulla using a video otoscope. Repeat myringotomies and flushing of the middle ear are necessary to keep the middle ear free of mucus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herrtage, E</author><author>Houlton, J E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collapsing Clumber spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>334</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Acidosis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Physical Exertion</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year></dates><accession-num>516334</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.105.14.334-b</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaimio, Mirja</author><author>Saijonmaa-Koulumies, Leena</author><author>Laitinen-Vapaavuori, Outi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survey of otitis externa in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>14</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Finland</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Otitis Externa</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28241842</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13028-017-0282-3</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: American Cocker Spaniels are overrepresented among breeds that  require surgery as a treatment of end-stage otitis externa. However, the prevalence of otitis externa (OE) in this breed remains unknown. We reviewed the year 2010 medical records of 55 private veterinary clinics in Finland to determine the prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels compared with English Cocker and English and Welsh Springer Spaniels. An American Cocker Spaniel owner questionnaire was designed to identify potential risk factors for end-stage OE. RESULTS: From the medical records of 98,736 dogs, the prevalence of OE was highest in Welsh Springer Spaniels (149 out of 468, 31.8%, [95% confidence interval 27.6-36.0]), followed by American Cocker (89/329, 27.0%, [22.2-31.7]), English Springer (96/491, 19.6%, [16.1-23.1]) and English Cocker Spaniels (231/1467, 15.7%, [13.8-17.6]). The mean number of OE episodes in ear-diseased dogs and the number of ear surgeries were highest in American Cocker Spaniels. Owner questionnaires were received for 151 American Cocker Spaniels, 85 (56%) of which had suffered from OE. In 47% (40/85) of these dogs, OE occurred without concurrent skin lesions, 46% (33/72) displayed the first signs of OE before 1 year of age. In 24% (20/85) of the dogs, the signs of OE recurred within 1 month or continued despite treatment, 16% (14/85) required surgery (n = 11) or were euthanized (n = 5; 2 of the operated dogs and 3 others) due to severe OE. The onset of OE before the age of 1 year significantly increased the risk (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.6) of end-stage OE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland was higher than previously reported in Cocker Spaniels, but the highest prevalence of OE was found in Welsh Springer Spaniels. Compared to the other Spaniels, OE was more often recurrent and more frequently surgically managed in American Cocker Spaniels. Based on the questionnaire, early onset (&lt;1 year) of OE increased the risk of end-stage OE. In American Cocker Spaniels, OE requires an intensive approach from the first treatment, and prevention of recurrence should be emphasised. The causes and treatment of OE in this breed warrant further study.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sudunagunta, S</author><author>Hamilton-Elliott, J</author><author>Dukes-McEwan, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitral valve dysplasia in eight English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>52-60</pages><volume>33</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Systolic Murmurs</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33360833</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2020.11.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: To describe the signalment, physical examination, and  echocardiographic findings of a series of English Springer Spaniels (ESSs) diagnosed with congenital mitral valve dysplasia (MD). ANIMALS: Eight client-owned ESSs with congenital MD referred for murmur investigation and/or suspected congestive heart failure (CHF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective case series. Medical records and echocardiograms were reviewed to collect relevant data. Echocardiograms were assessed for the following abnormalities consistent with MD: thickened valve leaflets or leaflet tips, a 'hockey stick' appearance to the valve leaflets, abnormal length of one leaflet with respect to the other, and tethering of one or both leaflets to the papillary muscles. RESULTS: All eight dogs showed the typical echocardiographic lesions associated with MD: thickened leaflet tips (5/8), 'hockey stick' appearance (5/8), elongated anterior leaflet (4/8), tethering of one or both leaflets (7/8). Seven of the eight dogs presented in CHF. Six of the eight dogs had left ventricular dilation in both systole and diastole. Two of the eight dogs had reduced systolic function as assessed by ejection fraction/fractional shortening; however end-systolic volume index was increased in 6/8 dogs. Two dogs subsequently developed atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital MD should be considered in ESSs with a left-sided apical systolic murmur, particularly in younger dogs. The valve changes seen are similar to those reported in other breeds with MD (thickened leaflet tips, hockey stick appearance to open leaflet tips, abnormal leaflet tethering, abnormally shaped leaflets) and may result in marked remodeling and CHF.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Griffiths, I R</author><author>Duncan, I D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collapsing Clumber spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>405</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Muscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year></dates><accession-num>552740</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.105.17.405</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stee, Kimberley</author><author>Van Poucke, Mario</author><author>Peelman, Luc</author><author>Lowrie, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paradoxical pseudomyotonia in English Springer and Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>253-257</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Isaacs Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Physical Conditioning, Animal</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31729100</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15660</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Paramyotonia congenita and Brody disease are well-described  conditions in humans, characterized by exercise-induced myotonic-like muscle stiffness. A syndrome similar to Brody disease has been reported in cattle. Reports of a similar syndrome in dogs are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To define and describe the clinical, diagnostic, and genetic features and disease course of paradoxical pseudomyotonia in Spaniel dogs. ANIMALS: Seven client-owned dogs (4 English Springer Spaniels and 3 English Cocker Spaniels) with clinically confirmed episodes of exercise-induced generalized myotonic-like muscle stiffness. METHODS: Sequential case study. RESULTS: All dogs were &lt;24 months of age at onset. The episodes of myotonic-like generalized muscle stiffness always occurred with exercise, and spontaneously resolved with rest in &lt;45 seconds in all but 1 dog. Extreme outside temperatures seemed to considerably worsen episode frequency and severity in most dogs. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry including electrolytes, urinalysis, brain magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electromyography, motor nerve conduction velocity, ECG, and echocardiography were unremarkable. Muscle biopsy samples showed moderate but nonspecific muscle atrophy. The episodes seemed to remain stable or decrease in severity and frequency in 6/7 dogs, and often could be decreased or prevented by avoiding the episode triggers. The underlying genetic cause is not identified yet, because no disease-causing variants could be found in the coding sequence or splice sites of the 2 major candidate genes, SCN4A and ATP2A1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Paradoxical pseudomyotonia is a disease affecting Spaniels. It is of variable severity but benign in most cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Basili, M</author><author>Pedro, B</author><author>Hodgkiss-Geere, H</author><author>Navarro-Cubas, X</author><author>Graef, N</author><author>Dukes-McEwan, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low plasma taurine levels in English cocker spaniels diagnosed with dilated  cardiomyopathy.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>570-579</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Taurine</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33594697</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13306</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate taurine levels in English  cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and assess their survival time and natural progression of their disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective comparison of English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype with and without taurine deficiency at the cardiology department of a UK academic referral centre between 2008 and 2018. RESULTS: Taurine plasma concentration was available in 16 English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype; 13 of 16 had congestive heart failure and three of 16 did not. Taurine concentration was low (&lt;50 μmol/L) in 13 of 16 and normal in three of 16. Deficient dogs received taurine supplementation in addition to conventional cardiac medications. Eight dogs were still alive at the end of this study and eight were dead. MST for all dogs included in the study was 2800 days. Left ventricular systolic function improved and left ventricular dimensions reduced in English cocker spaniels with taurine deficiency following taurine supplementation and conventional cardiac therapy, although similar results were observed in English cocker spaniels with normal taurine concentration on cardiac therapy alone. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Based on laboratory reference intervals, low taurine concentrations were common in English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy, showing a possible association between dilated cardiomyopathy in English cocker spaniels and taurine deficiency; supplementation with taurine was not curative.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sodhi, Nidhi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In this issue-May 2016: Yersinia spp. in sheep · Secondary damage in downer  cows · Fixed-time artificial insemination and fertility in dairy heifers · Primary ciliary dyskinesia in two English Cocker Spaniels · Endurance vs sprinting exercise in dogs · Hepatic metastasis in canine appendicular osteosarcoma · Gastric duplication cyst in a puppy.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>127-128</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Veterinary Medicine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27113980</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.12440</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tirrito, Federica</author><author>Cozzi, Francesca</author><author>Bonaldi, Martina</author><author>Corazzo, Stefania</author><author>Contiero, Barbara</author><author>Lombardo, Rocco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ventriculomegaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like malformation:  relationship with clinical and imaging findings.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>1185-1193</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hydrocephalus</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Seizures</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35831130</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1292/jvms.22-0134</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of this study was to calculate lateral ventricles dimension in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs with Chiari-like malformation and investigate the association between ventriculomegaly and signalment, clinical signs, ventricular asymmetry, grade of Chiari-like malformation, syringomyelia and index of medullary kinking. Retrospectively, 43 client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, older than 1 year of age, with magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation were enrolled. Initial and follow-up (up to 36 months) clinical status was graded. Images were reviewed to quantify the enlargement of lateral ventricles, evaluate ventricular symmetry, grade of Chiari-like malformation, grade of syringomyelia and medullary kinking index. Cases presenting epileptic seizures during the evaluation period were also recorded. The most common initial clinical signs were scratching and neck pain. Ventriculomegaly was identified in 70% of dogs, Chiari-like malformation grade 2 was observed in 77% of cases, ventricular asymmetry and syringomyelia were identified in 54% and 80% of dogs, respectively; the median medullary kinking index was 37.77%. Moreover, 28% of dogs presented epileptic seizures. No significant association was identified between dimension of lateral ventricles and signalment, clinical signs, and imaging findings; no significant association was identified between ventriculomegaly and epilepsy (P≥0.05). In conclusion, the prevalence of ventriculomegaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels is high but this finding does not seem related to the severity of clinical signs, presence of Chiari-like malformation, syringomyelia and craniocervical junction abnormalities such as medullary kinking.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christen, Matthias</author><author>Bongers, Jos</author><author>Mathis, Déborah</author><author>Jagannathan, Vidhya</author><author>Quintana, Rodrigo Gutierrez</author><author>Leeb, Tosso</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ACADM Frameshift Variant in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Medium-Chain  Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency.</title><secondary-title>Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Codon, Nonsense</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatty Acids</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36292732</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/genes13101847</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-year-old, male neutered Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) presented with  complex focal seizures and prolonged lethargy. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical signs, metabolic changes and underlying genetic defect. Blood and urine organic acid analysis revealed increased medium-chain fatty acids and together with the clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 923 control genomes of different dog breeds. The ACADM gene encoding MCAD was considered the top functional candidate gene. The genetic analysis revealed a single homozygous private protein-changing variant in ACADM in the affected dog. This variant, XM_038541645.1:c.444_445delinsGTTAATTCTCAATATTGTCTAAGAATTATG, introduces a premature stop codon and is predicted to result in truncation of ~63% of the wild type MCAD open reading frame, XP_038397573.1:p.(Thr150Ilefs*6). Targeted genotyping of the variant in 162 additional CKCS revealed a variant allele frequency of 23.5% and twelve additional homozygous mutant dogs. The acylcarnitine C8/C12 ratio was elevated ~43.3 fold in homozygous mutant dogs as compared to homozygous wild type dogs. Based on available clinical and biochemical data together with current knowledge in humans, we propose the ACADM frameshift variant as causative variant for the MCAD deficiency with likely contribution to the neurological phenotype in the index case. Testing the CKCS breeding population for the identified ACADM variant is recommended to prevent the unintentional breeding of dogs with MCAD deficiency. Further prospective studies are warranted to assess the clinical consequences of this enzyme defect.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Knowler, Susan P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inheritance of occipital bone hypoplasia (Chiari type I malformation) in Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>673-678</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epilepsies, Myoclonic</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15515584</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2004)18&lt;673:ioobhc&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Occipital bone hypoplasia with foramen magnum obstruction and secondary  syringomyelia (SM) is a common condition in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) that is similar to human Chiari type I malformation. A worldwide family tree of more than 5,500 CKCSs spanning a maximum of 24 generations was established by obtaining pedigree information from 120 dogs diagnosed with SM secondary to occipital bone hypoplasia. The ongoing study showed 6 of 8 great grandparents of all affected dogs could be traced back to 2 female ancestors so that all 8 were descended from one or the other or both. The disease appears to be more severe and have an earlier onset with increased inbreeding, especially when breeding from affected dogs. The family tree of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) appears to be a different subset of the CKCS population, although some overlap was observed. Idiopathic epilepsy is more frequent in lines originating from whole-color dogs. Selection for coat color is believed to have influenced the development of both occipital hypoplasia with secondary SM and IE. In addition, breeding guidelines to reduce the incidence of mitral valve disease have placed further pressures on the gene pool.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaimio, Mirja L M</author><author>Lappalainen, Anu K</author><author>Rahmani, Vahideh</author><author>Männikkö, Sofia</author><author>Laitinen-Vapaavuori, Outi M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aural CT characteristics of American Cocker Spaniels have features of both  mesaticephalic and brachycephalic breeds.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>649-658</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear Canal</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Externa</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32808397</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.12900</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Otitis externa and otitis media are common in American Cocker Spaniels, however  breed-specific aural CT descriptions are currently lacking. This prospective and retrospective, observational, analytical study aimed to describe quantitative CT characteristics of the horizontal ear canal and the tympanic bulla in American Cocker Spaniels versus similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs. We prospectively performed clinical examinations and aural CT scanning for 38 American Cocker Spaniels. Computed tomographic transverse area of the osseous horizontal ear canal (TA1), transverse area of the widest air-filled part of the cartilaginous horizontal ear canal (TA2), tympanic bulla volume, and tympanic bulla wall thickness were measured. The TA1 and TA2 measurements were compared with those of 23 retrospectively recruited, similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs that had undergone CT-scanning of the head for non-ear-related reasons. The TA1 and TA2 did not differ for healthy American Cocker Spaniels and mesaticephalic dogs. Severely affected American Cocker Spaniels had significantly smaller TA2 (P &lt; .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient for intraobserver and interobserver repeatability was 0.972 and 0.983 for TA1 and 0.994 and 0.998 for TA2, respectively. Variation between individuals was subjectively noted in healthy and affected American Cocker Spaniels, but mean tympanic bulla volume was slightly smaller in relation to body weight, and the tympanic bulla wall was thicker than in previous reports for mesaticephalic dogs. The tympanic bulla wall appeared thicker rostro-ventrally than caudo-ventrally in 44% of the dogs. Our results imply that a relatively thick tympanic bulla wall may be a normal CT variation and should be interpreted cautiously in this breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Ghilardi, Sara</author><author>Zamarian, Valentina</author><author>Ceciliani, Fabrizio</author><author>Brambilla, Paola G</author><author>Lecchi, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulating MiR-30b-5p is upregulated in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected  by early myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0266208</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35816500</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0266208</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>There is a growing interest in developing new molecular markers of heart disease  in young dogs affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease. The study aimed to measure 3 circulating microRNAs and their application as potential biomarkers in the plasma of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with early asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valve disease. The hypothesis is that healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have different microRNA expression profiles than affected dogs in American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage B1. The profiles can differ within the same class among subjects of different ages. This is a prospective cross-sectional study. Thirty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in ACVIM stage B1 were divided into three groups (11 younger than 3 years, 11 older than 3 years and younger than 7 years, and 11 older than 7 years), and 11 healthy (ACVIM stage A) dogs of the same breed were included as the control group. Three circulating microRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR30b-5p, and miR-128-3p) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using TaqMan® probes. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). MiR-30b-5p was significantly higher in ACVIM B1 dogs than in ACVIM A subjects, and the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.79. According to the age of dogs, the amount of miR-30b-5p was statistically significantly higher in group B1&lt;3y (2.3 folds, P = 0.034), B1 3-7y (2.2 folds, P = 0.028), and B1&gt;7y (2.7 folds, P = 0.018) than in group A. The area under the receiver operating curves were fair in discriminating between group B1&lt;3y and group A (AUC 0.780), between B1 3-7y and A (AUC 0.78), and good in discriminating between group B1&gt;7y and A (AUC 0.822). Identifying dogs with early asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valve disease through the evaluation of miR-30b-5p represents an intriguing possibility that certainly merits further research. Studies enrolling a larger number of dogs with preclinical stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease are needed to expand further and validate conclusively the preliminary findings from this report.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gomes, Filipe Espinheira</author><author>Casanova, Maria Isabel</author><author>Mouttham, Lara</author><author>Bannasch, Danika L</author><author>Park, Sangwan</author><author>Kim, Soohyun</author><author>Young, Laura J</author><author>Daley, Nicole L</author><author>Thomasy, Sara M</author><author>Castelhano, Marta G</author><author>Ledbetter, Eric C</author><author>Holmberg, Bradford</author><author>Boyd, Ryan</author><author>Van Der Woerdt, Alexandra</author><author>McDonald, Jessica</author><author>Hayward, Jessica J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A genome-wide association study to investigate genetic loci associated with  primary glaucoma in American Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>83</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genetic Loci</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Open-Angle</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36170212</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.22.07.0106</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic associations with primary glaucoma (PG) in  American Cocker Spaniels using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). ANIMALS: A nationwide ambidirectional case-control cohort study was performed in American Cocker Spaniels that had an ophthalmic examination performed by a veterinarian. Ninety-four dogs with PG (cases) and 111 dogs without glaucoma (controls) met phenotypic criteria and had a blood sample collected after receiving informed owner consent. PROCEDURES: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and genotyped (CanineHD BeadChip, Illumina Inc). A case-control GWAS using a linear mixed model was performed, and 3 significance thresholds were calculated (1) using a Bonferroni correction on all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the GWAS, (2) using a Bonferroni correction on only the unlinked SNPs from a pruned data set, and (3) using 10,000 random phenotype permutations. RESULTS: Following genotype data quality control, 89 cases and 93 controls were included in the GWAS. We identified an association on canine chromosome (CFA10); however, it did not reach statistical significance. Potential candidate genes within the surrounding linkage disequilibrium interval include coiled-coil domain containing 85A (CCDC85A) and extracellular growth factor containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Primary glaucoma in the American Cocker Spaniel is a complex heterogeneous disease that may be influenced by a locus on CFA10. The candidate genes CCDC85A and EFEMP1 within the identified linkage disequilibrium interval have been shown to be involved in human open-angle glaucoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Erratum for &quot;Investigation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the NR3C1a  glucocorticoid receptor gene in Cocker Spaniels with primary immune thrombocytopenia&quot;.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1846</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35962635</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16517</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Axelsson, Erik</author><author>Ljungvall, Ingrid</author><author>Bhoumik, Priyasma</author><author>Conn, Laura Bas</author><author>Muren, Eva</author><author>Ohlsson, Åsa</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth Høier</author><author>Engdahl, Karolina</author><author>Hagman, Ragnvi</author><author>Hanson, Jeanette</author><author>Kryvokhyzha, Dmytro</author><author>Pettersson, Mats</author><author>Grenet, Olivier</author><author>Moggs, Jonathan</author><author>Rio-Espinola, Alberto Del</author><author>Epe, Christian</author><author>Taillon, Bruce</author><author>Tawari, Nilesh</author><author>Mane, Shrinivas</author><author>Hawkins, Troy</author><author>Hedhammar, Åke</author><author>Gruet, Philippe</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correction: The genetic consequences of dog breed formation-Accumulation of  deleterious genetic variation and fixation of mutations associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>e1010039</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35085237</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1010039</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009726.].</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Romito, Giovanni</author><author>Castagna, Prisca</author><author>Sabetti, Maria Chiara</author><author>Cipone, Mario</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrocardiographic findings in healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Pugs,  and English Bulldogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>688-695</pages><volume>261</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36701225</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.22.12.0542</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the ECG findings in 3 different canine brachycephalic  breeds: the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, the Pug, and the English Bulldog (EB). ANIMALS: 135 healthy dogs (50 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 50 Pugs, and 35 EBs). PROCEDURES: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to identify healthy dogs ≥ 1 year old that had undergone an ECG. The Mann-Whitney U test or the Student t test were used to compare continuous variables between male and female dogs, whereas the χ2 test was used for categorical variables. Spearman correlation coefficients between ECG measurements and age and body weight were also calculated in the case of continuous variables, whereas the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for categorical ones. RESULTS: Electrocardiographic parameters of healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels overall fitted with traditional reference intervals cited in textbooks; in contrast, 28% of Pugs and 20% of EBs showed a shift of the QRS-complex mean electrical axis (QRS-MEA). In Pugs and EBs, the mean/median QRS-MEA value was 56° (from 0° to 100°) and 59° (from 20° to 100°), respectively. All axis shifts were left shifts (in Pugs, from 0° to 34°; in EBs, 20° to 39°). Only a few meaningful differences were found when comparing ECG variables between males and females. Similarly, only 1 statistically significant correlation was found between ECG parameters and age and body weight. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Healthy Pugs and EBs present a trend to a left shift of the QRS-MEA. This should be considered when interpreting ECG tracings in these breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wesselowski, Sonya</author><author>Blake, Amanda B</author><author>Gordon, Sonya G</author><author>Suchodolski, Jan S</author><author>Steiner, Joerg M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Whole blood and plasma taurine reference intervals in adult Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels and correlations between taurine concentration, diet and mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>S71-S76</pages><volume>260</volume><issue>S3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diet</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Taurine</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36136933</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.22.07.0280</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine breed-specific reference intervals for whole blood (WB)  and plasma taurine concentrations in adult, overtly healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and determine whether taurine concentrations differ across preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) stages or between CKCSs eating diets that meet World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) nutritional guidelines versus other diets. ANIMALS: 200 privately owned CKCSs. PROCEDURES: Clinically healthy adult CKCSs were recruited prospectively. Diet and supplement history was collected. Dogs were staged by echocardiography using MMVD consensus guidelines. Taurine concentrations were measured in deproteinized lithium heparin WB and plasma samples with the postcolumn ninhydrin derivatization method on a dedicated amino acid analyzer. RESULTS: There were 12 stage A (6%), 150 stage B1 (75%), and 38 stage B2 (19%) CKCSs. Seventy-eight dogs (39%) were reported by their owners to be eating diets meeting WSAVA nutritional guidelines; 116 (58%) were not. Taurine concentrations in plasma (P = .444) and WB (P = .073) were not significantly different across MMVD stages or between CKCSs eating diets meeting WSAVA nutritional guidelines versus other diets (P = .345 and P = .527, respectively). Reference intervals for WB taurine (152 to 373 µM) and plasma taurine (51 to 217 µM) concentrations in CKCSs were generated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In CKCSs, taurine concentrations do not differ significantly based on preclinical MMVD stage, nor do they differ significantly based on consumption of a diet that does or does not meet WSAVA nutritional guidelines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mead, Sophie E</author><author>Beijerink, Niek J</author><author>O'Brien, Mitchell</author><author>Wade, Claire M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic Variants at the Nebulette Locus Are Associated with Myxomatous Mitral  Valve Disease Severity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Patient Acuity</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36553559</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/genes13122292</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The most common cardiovascular disease in domestic dogs is myxomatous mitral  valve disease (MMVD), accounting for 75% of all cardiac disease. An increase in age is generally associated with increased incidence of the disease, but Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) exhibit an unusually high prevalence of early-onset MMVD, and thus, potentially greater cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to other breeds. Previous research has suggested that selected candidate risk alleles for MMVD are fixed in CKCSs, including six locations within the Nebulette (NEBL) gene on CFA2. The current study analysed genotypes of 180 Australian CKCSs at the identified risk loci. Of these, 178 were phenotyped for severity of disease by echocardiographic measurements of left atrium to aortic root ratio (LA:Ao) and weight normalised left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVIDdN). Genotyping array markers correctly predicted the genotype at the risk-variant loci in the CKCS population, and the NEBL1, NEBL2 and NEBL3 variants were observed to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium in this cohort. The CKCS cohort included 6/178 dogs being heterozygous for the protective/wild-type alleles at the NEBL locus. The mean LA:Ao and LVIDdN scores of these dogs heterozygous at NEBL1-3 variants were significantly smaller, and with significantly lower variance compared to age-matched CKCSs that were homozygous for risk alleles. The lower cardiac measurements in the heterozygous dogs indicate a significantly reduced risk of severe MMVD disease. Our analysis suggests that despite relative fixation of the NEBL risk alleles, healthy reference alleles at NEBL1-3 exist in low frequency in the CKCS breed and can be used to reduce MMVD severity and mortality.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wiersma, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Genetic nephropathies in dogs: molecular genetic studies of Norwegian Eland dogs  and English cocker spaniels].</title><secondary-title>Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde</full-title></periodical><pages>158</pages><volume>134</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Kidney Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19322990</accession-num><language>dut</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mortensen, Danny</author><author>Thoefner, Maria Soendergaard</author><author>Agerholm, Joergen Steen</author><author>Slumstrup, Lasse</author><author>Jensen, Troels Staehelin</author><author>Bjerrum, Ole Jannik</author><author>Berendt, Mette</author><author>Nyengaard, Jens Randel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dorsal horn volume loss and pain pathway changes in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels with syringomyelia, signs of pain, and phantom scratching.</title><secondary-title>Pain</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pain</full-title></periodical><pages>2365-2379</pages><volume>163</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35353770</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002630</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Central neuropathic pain is a core clinical sign of syringomyelia in humans and  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs. This histopathological study used spinal cords from CKCS dogs with syringomyelia to investigate the following conditions: (1) whether specific structural cervical spinal cord entities involved in nociception were affected by loss of neuroparenchyma or other pathological changes in CKCS dogs with pain-related behaviour and phantom scratching, (2) whether pain-related behaviour or phantom scratching correlated with loss of a specific anatomical entity or upregulation of glia cells, and (3) whether syringomyelia-related lesions affected specific functional spinal cord units of nociception. Spinal cord segments C1-C8 from CKCS dogs with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed syringomyelia and clinical signs of pain and phantom scratching (n = 8) were compared with those from CKCS dogs without syringomyelia (n = 4). Dogs with unilateral scratching (n = 7) had a volume loss ( P = 0.043) of the dorsal horn laminae I-III in the ipsilateral side compared with the contralateral dorsal horn. A clear pattern of ipsilateral changes in the dorsal root entry zone characterised by deafferentation and reorganization of first-order axons into deeper laminae was found in cases with lateralised scratching. Significant changes in cell number density were not found for astrocytes or microglia, suggesting that the dogs represented cases of end-stage syringomyelia and thus could not reveal astrogliosis and microgliosis, which may be involved in the early phases of syrinx development and phantom scratching. The present relationship between clinical findings and dorsal horn and pain pathway pathology in CKCS dogs suggests that these dogs may be of interest as a supplement to experimental model pain research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Locatelli, Chiara</author><author>Manfredi, Martina</author><author>Bassi, Jessica</author><author>Spediacci, Carlotta</author><author>Ghilardi, Sara</author><author>Zani, Davide D</author><author>Brambilla, Paola G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed-specific vertebral heart score, vertebral left atrial size, and  radiographic left atrial dimension in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels: Reference interval study.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>156-163</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Atria</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34796576</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.13036</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are predisposed to developing myxomatous  mitral valve disease (MMVD), with radiographs frequently used to screen for evidence of left-sided cardiomegaly secondary to MMVD. Vertebral heart size (VHS), vertebral left atrial size (VLAS), modified VLAS (M-VLAS), and radiographic left atrial dimension (RLAD) are reported as objective measurements of global heart size and left atrial size. Normal VHS in CKCS (10.6 ± 0.5) is reportedly higher than the non-breed-specific value (9.7±0.5). Breed-specific VLAS, M-VLAS, and RLAD cut-offs have not been reported in CKCS. The aim of this prospective reference interval study was to describe the VHS, VLAS, M-VLAS, and RLAD values for 30 clinically healthy adult CKCS. Inclusion criteria were unremarkable physical examination, normal echocardiography, and thoracic radiographs without malposition/abnormalities. There were 22 female and eight male dogs. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years. The VHS mean value in our sample was 10.08 ± 0.56 (95% range, 9.87-10.29). This was significantly greater than a previously published general canine reference value of 9.7 ± 0.5 and significantly less than a previously published CKCS breed-specific value of 10.6 ± 0.5 (P &lt; 0.01). Mean VLAS, M-VLAS, and the RLAD values in our study were 1.79 ± 0.3 (95% range, 1.68-1.9), 2.23 ± 0.44 (95% range, 2.06-2.39), and 1.2 ± 0.34 (95% range, 1.07-1.33), respectively. These were significantly less than previously published reference interval values (P &lt; 0.001). The VHS, M-VLAS, and the RLAD were not affected by sex, body weight, or BCS; whereas the VLAS was moderately affected by body weight. Findings from this study can be used as background for future thoracic radiographic assessments in CKCS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tayler, Sarah</author><author>Hazuchova, Katarina</author><author>Riddle, Anna</author><author>Swann, James W</author><author>Glanemann, Barbara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the NR3C1a glucocorticoid  receptor gene in Cocker Spaniels with primary immune thrombocytopenia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1281-1286</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Glucocorticoids</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Glucocorticoid</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35689373</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16468</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In dogs, 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described  in the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1a, 2 of which were nonsynonymous SNPs in exons 2 and 8. The clinical importance of these SNPs is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether SNPs in NR3C1a are associated with clinical outcome in Cocker Spaniels with primary immune thrombocytopenia (pITP). ANIMALS: Twenty-four Cocker Spaniels with pITP presented to a referral center. Dogs were classified as slow (n = 11) or fast responders (n = 12) based on time required after initiating glucocorticoid treatment to achieve a platelet count &gt;70 000/μL. METHODS: Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from stored blood samples before amplification by PCR and sequencing of exons 2 and 8 of NR3C1a. Associations between genotype and clinical response variables were investigated. RESULTS: Neither previously identified nonsynonymous SNPs were identified. The synonymous SNP NR3C1a:c.798C&gt;T in exon 2 was found at an increased prevalence compared to a previous report. No difference was found in prevalence of any genotype at NR3C1a:c.798C&gt;T between fast and slow responders (P = .70). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: None of the previously reported nonsynonymous SNPs in exons 2 and 8 of the NR3C1a gene were detected in our cohort of Cocker Spaniels with pITP. The synonymous SNP NR3C1a:c.798C&gt;T in exon 2 was reported at a higher frequency than previously, but was not associated with outcome measures that estimated responsiveness to glucocorticoids.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Bionda, Arianna</author><author>Locatelli, Chiara</author><author>Cortellari, Matteo</author><author>Frattini, Stefano</author><author>Negro, Alessio</author><author>Crepaldi, Paola</author><author>Brambilla, Paola Giuseppina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Echocardiographic Evaluation of the Mitral Valve in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32825079</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani10091454</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to: (1) characterize  echocardiographic features of mitral valve in MMVD affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), focusing on dogs classified as American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) class B1; (2) compare echocardiographic data in ACVIM B1 dogs divided on the basis of age at time of MMVD diagnosis, in order to understand if different aged subjects had different echocardiographic patterns. Length (AMVL), width (AMVW) and area (AMVA) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, mitral valve prolapse, diameters of the mitral valve annulus in diastole (MVAd) and systole (MVAs) of 90 CKCS in different ACVIM classes, 64 of which in class B1, were measured. Valvular measurements were indexed to body weight using Wesselowski's scaling exponents. The presence of heart murmur did not discriminate between A and B1 classes (p = 0.128). Heart enlargement was more frequent in males (r(2) = 0.07, p = 0.013). Within class B1, older subjects showed significantly higher values of AMVA, AMVW, MVAd, MVAs and lower sphericity index (SI). Since many CKCS with MMVD have no murmur and their mitral valve has peculiarities, a specifically designed echocardiographic screening should be realized. In addition, different aged B1 dogs have different echocardiographic patterns that may imply different genetic and prognostic profiles.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prieto Ramos, Jorge</author><author>Corda, Andrea</author><author>Swift, Simon</author><author>Saderi, Laura</author><author>De La Fuente Oliver, Gabriel</author><author>Corcoran, Brendan</author><author>Summers, Kim M</author><author>French, Anne T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and Echocardiographic Findings in an Aged Population of Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33800666</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani11040949</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cardiac disease in  dogs. It varies from dogs without clinical signs to those developing left-sided congestive heart failure, leading to death. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) are particularly susceptible to MMVD. We hypothesised that within the elderly CKCS population, there is a sub-cohort of MMVD-affected dogs that do not have cardiac remodelling. The objectives of the present study were (i) to determine the prevalence and the degree of cardiac remodelling associated with MMVD; and (ii) assess the effect of age, gender, and body weight on echocardiographic status in a population of aged CKCSs. A total of 126 CKCSs ≥ 8 years old were prospectively included. They all had a physical and echocardiographic examination. A systolic murmur was detected in 89% of dogs; the presence of clinical signs was reported in 19% of them; and echocardiographic evidence of MMVD was described in 100%. Despite the high prevalence, 44.4% of the dogs were clear of echocardiographic signs of cardiac remodelling. Age was significantly associated with the presence and severity of cardiac remodelling and mitral valve prolapse. Our results showed that a proportion of elderly CKCS with confirmed MMVD did not undergo advanced stages of this pathology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghilardi, Sara</author><author>Lecchi, Cristina</author><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Romito, Giovanni</author><author>Colombo, Fabio M</author><author>Polli, Michele</author><author>Franco, Celeste</author><author>Brambilla, Paola G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prospective pilot study on the predictive significance of plasma miR-30b-5p  through the study of echocardiographic modifications in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by different stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease: The PRIME study.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0274724</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Pilot Projects</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36574372</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0274724</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Specific microRNAs expressions may accurately characterize different stages of  canine myxomatous mitral valve disease. This preliminary pilot study aimed to (1) describe the clinical and echocardiographic parameters of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease at different American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stages (B1, B2 and C) and healthy control group (ACVIM A), comparing the parameters collected during the first examination (T0) and the end of the follow-up (T1); (2) assess the association between the values of echocardiographic parameters at T1 and the expression profile of miR-30b-5p at T0. Thirty-five Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (median age 4.29 years and median weight 9 Kg) in different ACVIM stages were included (7 A, 19 B1, 6 B2 and 3 C). Inverse probability weighting analysis was performed to estimate the association of the exposure variable (miR-30b-5p) with the outcome variables (clinical and echocardiographic variables). Time was included as variable. The results pointed out that high levels of plasma miR-30b-5p corresponded to lower values of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter normalized for body weight, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexed for body weight, and left atrium-to aortic root ratio. Hence, higher miR-30b-5p expressions were associated with milder forms of mitral valve disease in our study population. In contrast, the results obtained for the intensity of heart murmur, the mitral regurgitation severity, and the Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic score) were not statistically significant. A relationship between high abundance of miR-30b-5p and myxomatous mitral valve disease that appear echocardiographically more stable over time has been demonstrated. In conclusion, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease that at the first cardiologic evaluation showed an upregulation of miR-30b-5p are expected to experience lesser variations on their echocardiographic examination between T0 and T1.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, S J</author><author>Simpson, K W</author><author>Baker, S</author><author>Spagnoletti, M A</author><author>Elwood, C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Macrothrombocytosis in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>281-283</pages><volume>135</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoanalysis</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Cell Size</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7817507</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.135.12.281</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Low platelet counts (&lt; 150 x 10(9)/litre) have been measured by autoanalyser in  cavalier King Charles spaniels with a wide range of diseases. However, the direct examination of blood smears revealed adequate numbers of platelets but many abnormally large platelets and it was not clear whether the large platelets were the result of disease or a breed abnormality. The numbers and diameters of the platelets in a group of clinically normal King Charles spaniels and a group of other breeds were measured by autoanalyser and manually. The automated platelet counts were lower in the King Charles spaniels than in the other breeds (P &lt; 0.01), but the manual counts were similar. The platelet diameter was greater in the cavalier King Charles spaniels (median values 2.5 to 3.75 microns, P &lt; 0.001) than the other breeds (median values 1.25 to 2.5 microns) and had a bimodal distribution with peaks at 1.25 to 2.5 microns and 3.75 to 5 microns. No clinical evidence of platelet dysfunction was detected. These findings indicate that cavalier King Charles spaniels may have large platelets which could lead to the erroneous diagnosis of thrombocytopenia by automated haematological analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sparks, Courtney R</author><author>Robertson, Ian</author><author>Olby, Natasha J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphometric analysis of spinal cord termination in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>717-725</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dura Mater</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neural Tube Defects</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30758868</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15437</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: There is an association between Chiari malformations, syringomyelia  (CMSM) and tethered cord syndrome (TCS) in people, suggesting Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with CMSM could also have TCS. Currently there are no data on the position of the caudal spinal cord structures in CKCS. OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare location of spinal cord termination in CKCS with weight-matched controls and to examine the relationship between SM and spinal cord termination. ANIMALS: Thirty-nine CKCS and 33 controls with thoracolumbar MRIs; 34 of 39 CKCS also had cervical MRIs. METHODS: Blinded retrospective study. Spinal cord and dural sac termination were determined from T2-weighted sagittal and transverse images and half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo sequences. Intra-observer reliability was determined using kappa analysis. Presence of SM was compared with location of spinal cord and dural sac termination. RESULTS: Intra-observer reliability was moderate for identifying spinal cord termination (Kappa = 0.6) and good for dural sac termination (Kappa = 0.8). The spinal cord terminated at lumbar vertebra 6 (L6) in 1, 7 (L7) in 22, and sacrum in 16 CKCS versus 9 at L6, 23 at L7, 1 at sacrum in controls. Spinal cord (P &lt; .001) and dural sac (P = .002) termination were significantly more caudal in CKCS compared to controls. The presence of thoracolumbar SM was associated with more caudal dural sac termination in CKCS (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The relationship between TL SM and possible spinal cord tethering because of a more caudal dural sac termination should be investigated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horton, P J</author><author>Hawthorne, W J</author><author>Walters, S N</author><author>Patel, A T</author><author>O'Connell, P J</author><author>Chapman, J R</author><author>Allen, R D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induction of allogeneic islet tolerance in a large-animal model.</title><secondary-title>Cell transplantation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell transplantation</full-title></periodical><pages>877-887</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Amylases</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glucose Tolerance Test</keyword><keyword>Graft Rejection</keyword><keyword>Graft Survival</keyword><keyword>Immune Tolerance</keyword><keyword>In Vitro Techniques</keyword><keyword>Insulin</keyword><keyword>Islets of Langerhans Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Kidney Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Pancreatectomy</keyword><keyword>Spleen</keyword><keyword>Transplantation Chimera</keyword><keyword>Transplantation, Homologous</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11202573</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/096368970000900614</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>For islet allotransplantation to become a therapy widely applicable to patients  with insulin-dependent diabetes, it will be important to avoid conventional immunosuppression and yet maintain long-term rejection-free islet survival. This possibility was tested in a large-animal model using mixed allogeneic chimeras established using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and donor-specific bone marrow transplantation (BMTX). Four recipient sex-mismatched and DLA class II-matched English springer spaniels became chimeric after TLI and donor-specific BMTX. Subsequent donor-specific renal allografts survived for more than a year. Acceptance of a donor-specific skin graft and rejection of a third-party graft demonstrated tolerance with maintenance of immunocompetence. Pancreatic microfragments containing islets were refluxed into the splenic vein of the recipient. Purified islets were placed under the capsule of spleen and liver. After 75 days, recipients underwent total native pancreatectomy. All four chimeric pancreatectomized dogs had functioning islet grafts 75 days after transplantation, evidenced by a prompt rise in serum insulin levels following an IVGTT and histological demonstration of islet tissue at the site of transplantation. After removal of the transplanted islet tissue, no insulin was released after IVGTT. In summary, intrasplenic allogeneic canine islets transplanted into chimeric dogs rendered tolerant to donor MHC survive and function for greater than 75 days in the absence of immunosuppression. This study represents proof of the concept that allogeneic islet transplants have the potential to reverse diabetes without the use of conventional immunosuppression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Vuolteenaho, O</author><author>Olsson, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship between different natriuretic peptides and severity of naturally  acquired mitral regurgitation in dogs with chronic myxomatous valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>7-16</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>19081325</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1760-2734(06)70002-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To study the responses of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), N-terminal  fragment of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to varying severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) in dogs with myxomatous valve disease (MVD). DESIGN: Case-control. DOGS: 103 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 27 normal individuals and 76 with varying degree of MR. PROCEDURE: Dogs were evaluated by physical examination, collection of venous blood, thoracic radiography and echocardiography. NT-proANP, ANP and BNP were measured in plasma using radio immunoassay (RIA). RESULTS: The mean concentrations of NT-proANP were 37.4 and 83.5 times higher than ANP and BNP, respectively. The mean ANP to BNP molar ratio was 2.6. Plasma concentrations of NT-proANP and ANP were slightly increased in asymptomatic dogs with increased cardiac dimensions; those with signs of decompensated heart failure (HF) had mean concentrations of NT-proANP and ANP 3 to 7 times higher than normal dogs. The BNP concentrations were increased only in dogs with decompensated HF and the levels were approximately twice as high in these dogs as in normal individuals. Univariate and multiple regression analysis showed that primarily left atrial and ventricular size influenced the plasma concentrations of all 3 peptides (increased with increasing measurement). Analyses of response operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that NT-proANP and ANP were more discriminating than BNP for either cardiomegaly of HF. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Natriuretic peptides, particularly NT-proANP and ANP, may be of benefit in the overall assessment of dogs with naturally occurring MR. Analysis of NT-proANP may be more useful than ANP owing to easier handling of the samples and less laborious assay.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petersen-Jones, S M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A review of research to elucidate the causes of the generalized progressive  retinal atrophies.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>5-18</pages><volume>155</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Retina</keyword><keyword>Retinal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Retinitis Pigmentosa</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9455155</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s1090-0233(98)80028-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a leading hereditary cause of blindness in  pedigree dogs as is its counterpart retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in humans. PRA shows genetic heterogeneity, as does RP, with several distinct forms already recognized and several more remaining to be investigated. Progress in molecular genetics has allowed the identification of the gene mutation responsible for an early onset form of PRA in the Irish setter, classified as rod-cone dysplasia type 1. The gene involved is the beta-subunit of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase which encodes a protein of the visual transduction cascade. Investigation of this gene in other breeds of dog with PRA has failed to find further breeds with the same mutation. Other genes that have been investigated include those encoding other proteins in the visual transduction cascade and for photoreceptor specific structural proteins. Further disease causing mutations have not yet been identified. Recently, developments in the mapping of the canine genome have produced sufficient markers to allow preliminary mapping of PRA genes. Already linkage to the most common form of PRA, progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd), has been established. prcd occurs in poodles, cocker spaniels and Labrador retrievers and possibly other breeds. The prcd-linked marker should enable development of a DNA-based test for the disease locus and facilitate identification of the actual disease causing gene mutation. Over the next few years we can look forward to the identification of several more PRA-causing gene mutations. This article will review research that seeks to characterize PRA in the dog, identify the responsible gene mutations, and elucidate the disease processes involved.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sack, G H Jr</author><author>Taylor, E W</author><author>Meyers, D A</author><author>Dragwa, C R</author><author>Cork, L C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine genetic linkage study using heterologous DNA probes.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>15-20</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>DNA Probes</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Linkage</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Lod Score</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length</keyword><keyword>Recombination, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Serum Amyloid A Protein</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8742818</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a022947</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We have used clones of 17 single-copy human DNA sequences to analyze their  counterparts in the genome of the domestic dog by heterologous hybridization. Ten of the 17 sequences represented anchor loci proposed for comparative mammalian mapping. Eight of 17 human clones (including three of the anchor loci) gave clear hybridization signals when used with Southern blots of canine DNA. Five of these eight (including two anchor loci) showed diallelic restriction fragment length polymorphisms in a large kindred of Brittany spaniels and could be used for segregation studies. Several probes chosen from different human chromosomes also were unlinked in the dog. By contrast, linkage was found between the canine counterparts of the closely linked human serum amyloid A gene family. Three markers linked on human chromosome II appeared not to be syntenic in the dog. DNA markers linked to various human genetic neuromuscular diseases were not linked to hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy which segregates in this kindred. However, there was evidence of possible linkage of this disorder with a canine counterpart of the tyrosinase gene. Segregation studies using heterologous single-copy DNA probes can be performed in dogs, but the level of inbreeding may reduce heterogeneity and limit the power of the analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kawamura, Yuta</author><author>Itou, Hiroki</author><author>Kida, Akitomo</author><author>Sunakawa, Hiroki</author><author>Kawamura, Kenji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microwave ablation for the control of bleeding from disintegrated mammary tumours  in two dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine and science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine and science</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36745474</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vms3.1089</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 16-year-old intact female Miniature Dachshund (dog 1) and a 13-year-old intact  female American Cocker Spaniel (dog 2) presented with a chief complaint of bleeding from a mammary gland tumour ulceration. Dog 1 was transferred to hospital from a local hospital in a haemorrhagic shock state with uncontrolled continuous bleeding. Thoracic radiographs revealed multiple nodular shadows suspected to be pulmonary metastasis. Dog 2 presented with intermittent bleeding from a mass lesion in the right fifth mammary gland. Due to high anaesthetic risk secondary to severe mitral valve insufficiency (ASA status III), the owner declined surgical excision of the tumour. Therefore, microwave ablation (MWA) under local anaesthesia was chosen in order to achieve adequate haemostasis. Both dogs received local anaesthesia around the bleeding mass lesion, and the disintegrated site was microwave-ablated; dog 1 underwent MWA after blood transfusion to improve the haemorrhagic shock. The ablation site was protected using a non-adhesive dressing. Scarring of the ulcerated site led to complete haemostasis in both cases. Dog 1 underwent tumorectomy on the 31st hospital day to prevent rebleeding; histopathology results were consistent with mammary adenocarcinoma with the ablation site covered by a capsule structure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report describing the use of MWA to stop bleeding from mammary tumours in veterinary medicine. MWA is a feasible and potentially effective palliative treatment modality to stop bleeding from disintegrated mammary tumours in dogs under local anaesthesia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tajima, Kazuki</author><author>Sinjyo, Akiko</author><author>Ito, Toshio</author><author>Noda, Yoshizumi</author><author>Goto, Hiroshi</author><author>Ito, Norihiko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus keratitis in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>240-243</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Chloramphenicol</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Keratitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23127159</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2012.01066.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The purpose of this study is to report a case of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) keratitis in a dog. A 7-year-old intact male American cocker spaniel that had undergone removal of a nictitating gland was referred for severe ulcerative keratitis. Slit-lamp examination showed swelling of the eyelid, mucopurulent discharge, conjunctival injection and chemosis, diffuse corneal edema and opacity, and a deep ulcer in central cornea. Gram staining of discharge from the eye demonstrated Gram-positive cocci. Despite topical ofloxacin, oxytetracycline and polymyxin B ophthalmic solution and intravenous cefazolin, there was no improvement. Cultures revealed MRSA that was sensitive only to chloramphenicol, vancomycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin. The antibiotic regimen was changed to topical and systemic chloramphenicol. After 9 days of treatment, although inflammation started to be resolved, the dog developed nonregenerative anemia. The antimicrobial regimen was changed again to topical and systemic vancomycin. Inflammation continued to improve over the next week. MRSA should be considered a potential organism in infectious keratitis, especially when general antibiotics are not effective. Although topical and systemic chloramphenicol and/or vancomycin are effective for treating MRSA keratitis, vancomycin should only be used when culture and susceptibility results indicate it is appropriate and no other options are available. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed case report of MRSA keratitis in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paul, A E H</author><author>Lenard, Z</author><author>Mansfield, C S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomography diagnosis of eight dogs with brain infarction.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>374-380</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Infarction</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>blood supply</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20854292</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2010.00629.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: Medical records of eight dogs presenting with acute onset of  neurological signs and a diagnosis of brain infarction as determined by computed tomography (CT) imaging were reviewed. DESIGN: Retrospective single-centre case review. RESULTS: Ischaemic infarction in the territory of the rostral cerebellar artery was identified in three spaniel-breed dogs. All cerebellar infarcts were non-haemorrhagic. Telencephalic infarcts were identified in five dogs, in the territories of the middle cerebral artery (2/5) and rostral cerebral artery (3/5). One of these dogs had an ischaemic infarction, but all other infarctions appeared haemorrhagic. All dogs were geriatric (≥ 8 years old), with concurrent medical conditions identified in six dogs. One dog was euthanased after diagnosis because of the severity of its neurological signs and one dog was euthanased as a result of associated renal disease 2 months after diagnosis. Six dogs were alive at least 1 year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: CT is useful in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident in dogs, which can present as a spectrum of images with early changes in attenuation and subtle mass effects detected after infarction. CT is particularly sensitive for detecting haemorrhagic infarction, but under-represent ischaemic and lacunar infarctions when compared with MRI.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broschk, C</author><author>Distl, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs--pathological, clinical, diagnosis and  genetic aspects].</title><secondary-title>DTW.

The age of onset of this progressive disease varies between 3 and 7 years of age. A juvenile form of DCM has been found in Portuguese Water Dogs and Doberman Pinscher Dogs. Some breeds such as Doberman pinscher, Newfoundland, Portuguese Water dog, Boxer, Great Dane, Cocker Spaniel and Irish Wolfhound exhibit a higher prevalence to DCM. There also seems to be a sex predisposition as male dogs are affected more often than female dogs and in Great Danes an X-linked recessive inheritance is likely. In Newfoundland and Boxer an autosomal dominant inheritance was found whereas an autosomal recessive inheritance was described in Portuguese Water Dogs. Atrial fibrillation as a cause or consequence of DCM is assumed for certain breeds. The causes of DCM are widely unknown in dogs. A genetic basis for this heart disease seems to exist. Apart from a few exceptions the mode of inheritance and the possible underlying gene mutations are not known for DCM in dogs. In humans mutations in several genes responsible for DCM have been identified. Comparative genetic analyses in dogs using genes causing DCM in men and a genome-wide scan with anonymus markers were not able to detect causative mutations or genomic regions harboring gene loci linked to DCM. The investigation of the genetic basis of canine DCM may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of DCM and may result in new therapeutic approaches and breeding strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breitschwerdt, Edward B</author><author>DebRoy, Chitrita</author><author>Mexas, Angela M</author><author>Brown, Talmage T</author><author>Remick, Amera K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isolation of necrotoxigenic Escherichia coli from a dog with hemorrhagic  pneumonia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>2001,2016-2019</pages><volume>226</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Typing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Virulence</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15989184</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2005.226.2016</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7-month-old sexually intact male Cocker Spaniel was admitted to the North  Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of lethargy, panting, and excessive salivation that had become progressively severe during a 5-hour period. Despite intensive medical care, the dog died within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, and death was attributed to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonia. Lung tissue collected at necropsy by use of swabs was cultured and yielded an isolate of Escherichia coli; because of the rapid progression of illness in an otherwise healthy dog, the isolate underwent virulence typing and was determined to be a necrotoxigenic E. coli. Necrotoxigenic E. coli produce a toxin called cytotoxic necrotizing factor and are known to be involved in extraintestinal infections, including urinary tract infection, in humans and animals. Virulence typing of E. coli isolates from dogs with peracute pneumonia is recommended to further characterize the epidemiologic characteristics and public health importance of necrotoxigenic E. coli.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gould, D J</author><author>Petersen-Jones, S M</author><author>Lin, C T</author><author>Sargan, D R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cloning of canine rom-1 and its investigation as a candidate gene for generalized  progressive retinal atrophies in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>391-396</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Rod Cell Outer Segment</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9589581</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2052.1997.00185.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Generalized progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA) represents a genetically  heterogenous group of retinal degenerations affecting pedigree dogs. Currently, we are using a candidate gene approach in an attempt to identify mutations causing gPRA in dogs. Here we report the cloning, sequencing and analysis of canine rom-1, a structural gene of the rod photoreceptor. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to look for polymorphisms segregating with gPRA in the English cocker spaniel, Labrador retriever, miniature poodle, miniature long-haired dachshund, Tibetan terrier, miniature schnauzer, Cardigan Welsh corgi and Irish wolfhound. Further investigation involved DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Our studies revealed the presence of three polymorphisms, none of which segregated with disease phenotype. Haplotype analysis identified four rom-1 alleles. Our results indicate that rom-1 is unlikely to be a cause of gPRA in the breeds of dog examined.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andersson, B</author><author>Andersson, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the etiology of &quot;Scotty Cramp&quot; and &quot;Splay&quot;--two motoring disorders common in  the Scottish Terrier breed.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>550-558</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hindlimb</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>7168431</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/BF03546773</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The skull-cap, the meninges, and the dorsal surface of the cerebral cortex were  inspected in 20 Scottish Terriers subjected to euthanasia because of severe Scotty Cramp, and in 1 Cocker Spaniel and 2 Scottish Terrier puppies sacrificed because of Splay (inability to stand on the hind legs). Apparent abnormalities observed in the 12 younger (6 weeks to 18 months old) Scotty Cramp animals were firm medial adhesion of the dura to the skull-cap (all animals), meningeal hemorrhage (10 animals), and bony jags on the inner side of the skull-cap making impressions in the underlying dura and cerebral cortex (8 animals). Similar bony irregularities causing durai and cortical impressions were observed in 5 out of 8 Scotty Cramp dogs belonging to a senior age group (3 to 11 years old). Meningeal hemorrhage was observed only in 1 animal belonging to this group, but consistent observations were scarified appearance of the dura along the midline and induration around superior cerebral veins medially in the cruciate sulcus. Meningeal hemorrhage and firm medial adhesion of the dura to the skull-cap were consistent observations in the Splay puppies (6 weeks to 3 months old). The possibility is discussed that the ultimate cause of Scotty Cramp and Splay may be abnormalities in the development of the parietal and frontal bones, of their interconnection, and of their relation to the underlying meninges. This in turn may exert mechanical, circulatory or other influences causing dysfunction of the cerebral motor cortex.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Domosławska, Anna</author><author>Zduńczyk, Sławomir</author><author>Janowski, Tomasz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improvement of Sperm Motility Within One Month Under Selenium and Vitamin E  Supplementation in Four Infertile Dogs with Low Selenium Status.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>293-297</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31276070</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/jvetres-2019-0025</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Significant improvement of sperm motility within one month effected  by oral supplementation of selenium and vitamin E was described in four infertile male dogs which failed to conceive in their last three matings with different bitches. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The dogs (a Golden Retriever, an English Cocker Spaniel, and two Tibetan Mastiffs) were supplemented daily with selenium (Se) (0.6 mg/kg organic Se yeast) and vitamin E (vit. E) (5 mg/kg) per os for 60 days. Semen was collected on days 0, 30, 60, and 90. The sperm concentration and motility parameters were evaluated by the CASA system, sperm morphology was explored by Diff-Quick staining, and live and dead spermatozoa were differentiated by eosin/nigrosin staining. The concentrations of Se and vit. E were measured in peripheral blood serum on semen collection days. RESULTS: Before administration, the concentrations of Se in blood plasma were low (86.0-165.0 μg/L). After 30 days of treatment there was an observable improvement in total and progressive sperm motility and kinematic parameters (VAP, VSK, VCL, ALH, BCF, and RAPID). The percentages of live and normal morphology sperm cells were also higher. There was also an observable increase in Se and vitamin E concentrations in blood serum. Bitches were successfully mated and delivered four to six puppies. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with Se and vit. E improved rapid sperm motility and restored fertility in infertile dogs with low Se status.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodríguez, F</author><author>Castro, P</author><author>Ramírez, G A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collision Tumour of Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Malignant Melanoma in the Oral  Cavity of a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>314-318</pages><volume>154</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Head and Neck Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Mouth Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms, Multiple Primary</keyword><keyword>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27147111</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2016.03.004</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7-year-old, male cocker spaniel was presented with a gingival proliferative  lesion in the rostral maxilla and enlargement of the regional lymph node. Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a collision tumour composed of two malignant populations, epithelial and melanocytic, with metastasis of the neoplastic melanocytes to the regional lymph node. The epithelial component consisted of trabeculae and islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium immunoreactive to cytokeratins. The melanocytic component had a varying degree of pigmentation of polygonal and spindle-shaped cells, growing in nests or densely packed aggregates and immunolabelled with S100, melanoma-associated antigen (melan A), neuron-specific enolase and vimentin antibodies. Protein markers involved in tumorigenesis or cell proliferation (i.e. COX-2, p53, c-kit and Ki67), were overexpressed by the neoplastic cells. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of an oral collision tumour involving malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lake-Bakaar, Geri A</author><author>Mok, Mai Yee</author><author>Kittleson, Mark D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fossa ovalis tear causing right to left shunting in a Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>541-545</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Septal Defects, Atrial</keyword><keyword>Hypertension, Pulmonary</keyword><keyword>Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23110980</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2012.07.004</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Left atrial tear is an infrequent sequela of severe mitral regurgitation due to  myxomatous mitral valve degeneration. Interatrial septal tear due to mitral regurgitation causing a left-to-right shunt is uncommon. Right to left shunting secondary to acute interatrial septal tear is very rarely reported in the human literature, and has not been reported in the veterinary literature in a dog. This case describes the clinical, radiographic, echocardiographic, gross pathologic, and histopathologic features of a dog presented in acute respiratory distress secondary to acute onset right to left shunting through the interatrial septum. This was later documented to be due to a tear in the septum secondary to tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The presence of an acquired right to left shunting atrial septal defect is of clinical and prognostic significance, and should be considered in cases of acute respiratory distress.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prémont, J E</author><author>Monclin, S</author><author>Farnir, F</author><author>Grauwels, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Perilimbal pocket technique for surgical repositioning of prolapsed nictitans  gland in dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>247</pages><volume>171</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exocrine Glands</keyword><keyword>Eyelid Diseases</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nictitating Membrane</keyword><keyword>Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Suture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Tears</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22791527</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.100582</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of this prospective study was to investigate the success rate,  practicality and complications of a new perilimbal pocket technique for the replacement of prolapsed nictitans gland in 30 dogs (44 eyes). A first incision was made in the bulbar conjunctiva, 2-3 mm from and parallel to the infero-nasal limbus, a second incision on the bulbar aspect of the nictitating membrane (NM), 2-3 mm parallel to the free edge. The gland was returned to its normal position by suturing the subconjunctival tissues of the NM to the episcleral tissues, using four to six interrupted horizontal mattress sutures. The English bulldog, Neapolitan mastiff, great dane and American cocker spaniel were commonly presented. Nictitans gland prolapse occurred prior to one year of age in 83.3 per cent of dogs, and unilaterally in 15 patients. The procedure was easy to perform, and had a 90.9 per cent success rate, with minimal complications. The median duration of follow-up, conducted by ophthalmic examination or telephone contact with the owners, was 21.5 months. Tear production and ocular health were not affected in 17 eyes with at least six months follow-up.

To this end, measurements of HR, f and Tb were performed weekly, on two consecutive days, for the first two postnatal months on puppies of three breeds of dogs (Rottweiler, Cocker Spaniel and Carlino dogs) with very different birth weights and postnatal growth patterns. Ambient conditions and feeding habits were constant for all puppies. The results indicated that (1) the 24-h average Tb increased and average HR and f decreased with growth, (2) the daily rhythms in Tb were apparent by 4 weeks, irrespective of the puppy's growth pattern, (3) the daily rhythm of Tb in the puppy was not necessarily following that of the mother; in fact, it could anticipate it. (4) The daily rhythms in HR and f were not apparent for the whole study period. We conclude that in neonatal dogs the onset of the daily rhythms of Tb has no obvious relationship with body size or rate of growth and is not cued by the maternal Tb rhythm. The daily rhythms of HR and f do not appear before 2 months of age. Hence, they are not in synchrony with those of Tb.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dahlbom, M</author><author>Andersson, M</author><author>Vierula, M</author><author>Alanko, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphometry of normal and teratozoospermic canine sperm heads using an image  analyzer: work in progress.</title><secondary-title>Theriogenology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theriogenology</full-title></periodical><pages>687-698</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>16728163</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0093-691x(97)00284-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Combining the traditional morphologic evaluation of spermatozoa with computer  assisted image analysis adds randomness, objectivity, repeatability and accuracy to morphometric measurements. We collected semen from 10 fertile, normospermic dogs aged 1 to 7 yr and from 3 teratozoospermic breed-matched dogs. Sperm head morphology was examined in Giemsa-stained smears by light microscopy, using a computer-assisted image analyzer and by transmission electron microscopy. We found significant variation in sperm head area, length, width and degree of roundness among normospermic individual dogs, indicating that it would be necessary to examine many more dogs before the size and shape of normal dog spermatozoa could be determined. The normospermic dogs were used as controls for the teratozoospermic cases. Case 1: A 2-yr-old subfertile Cavalier King Charles Spaniel had semen with small and narrow-based sperm heads and a proximal cytoplasmic droplet in most of the spermatozoa. With the image analysis system, sperm heads were shown to be smaller and more oval than in normospermic dogs. The variatons in size and shape were similar in magnitude to those of control dogs. An examined infertile half-brother had similar semen quality. Case 2: A 3-yr-old Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen with 2 unsuccesfull matings exhibited spermatozoa with severe abnormalities. Measured by image analyzer, sperm heads were irregular in shape and very small in area. One of the two littermates examined had semen of the same quality as the case dog. Case 3: A 3-yr-old fertile Golden Retriever had semen with giant sperm heads in about 50% of spermatozoa. Image analyzing results revealed 2 populations of different sized sperm heads. Giant heads consisted of 52.2% of all spermatozoa. The results of the study reported here suggest that the image analysis technique may be useful in evaluating structural changes in sperm morphology, supplementing visual assessment that is used in conventional methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saijonmaa-Koulumies, Leena E</author><author>Lloyd, David H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Colonization of neonatal puppies by Staphylococcus intermedius.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>123-130</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Colony Count, Microbial</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical</keyword><keyword>Mucous Membrane</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Complications, Infectious</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>transmission</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12074701</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-3164.2002.00290.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cutaneous and mucosal carriage of Staphylococcus intermedius was determined in  five Cavalier King Charles spaniel bitches, living in normal domestic environment, and their 18 puppies during the immediate prepartum period and after whelping, over a total of 8 weeks, using quantitative swab techniques. Within 8 h of birth S. intermedius was isolated from each puppy. The nose and mouth were the most frequently colonized mucosal sites (83 and 78%, respectively). At that time S. intermedius was isolated from the abdominal skin in 78% of the puppies. One day postpartum the mucosal populations increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) but fell 6 (P &lt; 0.01) and 20 (P &lt; 0.001) days later. Populations from abdominal skin reduced during the first and fourth weeks postpartum (P &lt; 0.05 for both). This study indicates that in the domestic environment S. intermedius establishes itself soon after birth. The level of colonization by S. intermedius in the bitches seems to influence the colonization by pathogenic staphylococci in puppies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fumfera, Jaromír</author><author>Halama, Radim</author><author>Procházka, Radek</author><author>Gál, Petr</author><author>Španiel, Miroslav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Strain Range Dependent Cyclic Hardening of 08Ch18N10T Stainless Steel-Experiments  and Simulations.</title><secondary-title>Materials (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Materials (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31861206</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ma12244243</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This paper describes and presents an experimental program of low-cycle fatigue  tests of austenitic stainless steel 08Ch18N10T at room temperature. The low-cycle tests include uniaxial and torsional tests for various specimen geometries and for a vast range of strain amplitude. The experimental data was used to validate the proposed cyclic plasticity model for predicting the strain-range dependent behavior of austenitic steels. The proposed model uses a virtual back-stress variable corresponding to a cyclically stable material under strain control. This internal variable is defined by means of a memory surface introduced in the stress space. The linear isotropic hardening rule is also superposed. A modification is presented that enables the cyclic hardening response of 08Ch18N10T to be simulated correctly under torsional loading conditions. A comparison is made between the real experimental results and the numerical simulation results, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed cyclic plasticity model.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meindel, Mandy</author><author>Pohlman, Lisa</author><author>DeBey, Brad</author><author>Higginbotham, Mary Lynn</author><author>Moon, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regional Nodal Metastasis of Humeral Chondrosarcoma in a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>346-351</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Amputation, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibiotics, Antineoplastic</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Chondrosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Doxorubicin</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>secondary</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26355588</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6198</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6 yr old castrated male English springer spaniel was evaluated with a 1 mo  history of progressive right forelimb lameness with recent swelling around the elbow joint. Physical examination findings included lameness of the right forelimb, muscle atrophy around the right shoulder, grade 2/6 heart murmur, and moderate dental disease. Results of a complete blood cell count and serum biochemical analysis were unremarkable with the exception of a mildly increased alkaline phosphatase (368 U/L; reference range, 128-328 U/L). Radiographs of the right elbow revealed a mixed lytic and proliferative osseous lesion most consistent with either neoplasia or infection. Thoracic radiographs and the echocardiogram were unremarkable. Fine-needle aspiration of the bone lesion was performed. The cytological diagnosis was chondrosarcoma. The right forelimb was amputated and the axillary lymph nodes were collected. Histopathological examination of the bone lesion and axillary lymph nodes revealed chondrosarcoma with metastasis to the lymph nodes. Lymph node metastasis of chondrosarcoma is rare and needs to be further evaluated as a prognostic indicator.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danielski, Alan</author><author>Yeadon, Russell</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Humero-anconeal elbow incongruity in spaniel breed dogs with humeral  intracondylar fissure: Arthroscopic findings.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>117-124</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arthroscopy</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Joint Diseases</keyword><keyword>Ulna</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34581450</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vsu.13728</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To report arthroscopic findings in dogs with humeral intracondylar  fissure (HIF) and compare these findings in joints of dogs not affected by HIF on preoperative CT images. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled clinical study. ANIMALS: Dogs with HIF (14 dogs, 21 elbows) and dogs without HIF (20 dogs, 31 elbows). METHODS: A caudo-medial arthroscope portal was used to inspect all elbow joints. Arthroscopic features of 21 joints of dogs with HIF were compared with 31 control elbows of HIF- negative dogs. RESULTS: All elbows with HIF showed a focal cartilage lesion on the caudal aspect of the humeral condyle. The lesions ranged from a simple indentation into the articular surface to a full thickness cartilage erosion. Humero-anconeal incongruity was identified in all elbows with HIF as absence of joint space at the point of contact between the tip of the anconeal process and the cartilage lesion, with a wider joint space distally within the ulnar trochlear notch. None of the elbows without HIF showed the cartilage lesion or evidence of humero-anconeal incongruity. CONCLUSION: Use of a novel arthroscope portal allowed description of a previously unreported cartilage lesion on the caudal humeral condyle of dogs with HIF. The lesion was found in all dogs with HIF but in no dogs without HIF. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Humero-anconeal incongruity and an associated cartilage lesion appear to be present in dogs with HIF. We propose that this lesion may be associated with humero-anconeal incongruity. This may be considered as a possible future therapeutic target for HIF.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sundaram, V</author><author>Mohammed, T</author><author>Rampersad, S</author><author>Williams, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A rare report on 18-month survival of a dog born with multiple anomalies  including atresia ani.</title><secondary-title>Morphologie : bulletin de l'Association des anatomistes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Morphologie : bulletin de l'Association des anatomistes</full-title></periodical><pages>252-258</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>350</issue><keywords><keyword>Abnormalities, Multiple</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anus, Imperforate</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Rectum</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33172785</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.morpho.2020.10.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Long term survival of animals with major congenital anomalies is very rare. This  report documents the 18-month survival of a dog with multiple anomalies including atresia ani. An 18-month-old black Cocker Spaniel bitch was presented for evaluation of prolapsed glands of the third eyelid involving both the eyes. Clinical examination revealed a single perineal opening, fecal matter in the vestibule, distended abdomen, hypoplastic vulva, and the absence of a tail without any neurological deficits. Abdominal contrast radiography revealed a distended colon with fecal stasis, rectovestibular fistula, termination of the rectum as a blind pouch, lumbar scoliosis due to block vertebrae, and the presence of only two hypoplastic coccygeal vertebrae. The case was diagnosed as atresia ani type II with rectovestibular fistula, hypoplastic vulva, lumbar scoliosis, and anury, in the global context of a caudal regression syndrome. The wide aperture fistula, connected to the vestibule, undamaged spinal cord and sacrum without any neurological deficits were the favorable prognostic factors that maintained continence and allowed the dog to survive to adult life with these anomalies. Thus, an appropriate bowel management program and specialty care can improve the quality of life and longevity of this animal.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Kyung-Mee</author><author>Nam, Hyun-Suk</author><author>Hussein, Kamal Hany</author><author>Woo, Heung-Myong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surgical management of vesicoureteral reflux with recurrent urinary tract  infection after renal transplantation in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>309-314</pages><volume>248</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections</keyword><keyword>Hydronephrosis</keyword><keyword>Kidney Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>Ureter</keyword><keyword>Urinary Tract Infections</keyword><keyword>Vesico-Ureteral Reflux</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26799110</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.248.3.309</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION A 3-year-old male Cocker Spaniel renal transplant recipient was  readmitted 39 weeks after transplantation because of acute clinical signs of pollakiuria, intermittent vomiting, decreased appetite, lethargy, and mild fever. CLINICAL FINDINGS Hydronephrosis and hydroureter were observed with ultrasonography and contrast cystography, and a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was made. Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Escherichia coli was also diagnosed on the basis of results of urine culture. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Despite treatment of the UTI with an appropriate antimicrobial for 6 weeks, the VUR persisted and the UTI recurred 9 weeks after cessation of antimicrobial treatment. Therefore, surgical correction by means of revision extravesicular ureteroneocytostomy was performed. Both VUR and hydronephrosis resolved after surgery. No recurrences of clinical signs of urinary tract complications were observed during the subsequent 22-month follow-up period. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that ureteral reimplantation with an extravesicular technique incorporating a long submucosal tunnel may be an effective treatment for VUR when medical management fails in canine renal transplant recipients with recurrent UTIs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, Junfu</author><author>Xia, Zhaofei</author><author>Chen, Jiangnan</author><author>Yu, Jinhai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and risk factors for canine obesity surveyed in veterinary practices  in Beijing, China.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>438-442</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Composition</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24042026</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.08.012</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An epidemiological survey of canine obesity was carried out in Beijing, China.  Cases (n=2391, 7 districts) were collected at 14 animal hospitals between April 2008 and April 2011. The body condition score (scales of 1-5) was used to assess obesity of the dogs (Burkholder and Toll, 2000; Laflamme, 1997). Obesity rates were analyzed with respect to breed, age, sex, neutering, food control, feeding frequency, reproduction status, food type, nutritional supplements, living environment, feeding time, number of pets per household, feeding purpose, activity control, exercise duration, exercise status and exercise type. The overall canine obesity rate was 44.4% in this survey. The risk factors for dog obesity were food type (non-commercial food, OR=1.377, p&lt;0.05), age (1-2 y, OR=0.044, p&lt;0.001), activity control (free activity, OR=0.685, p&lt;0.05), neutering (intact, OR=0.629, p&lt;0.01), sex (male, OR=0.628, p&lt;0.001), feeding frequency (Once per day, OR=0.521, p&lt;0.01). By dog breed, prevalence of obesity was high in pugs (70.7%), Cocker Spaniel (69.4%), Pekingese (51.9%), Pomeranian (54.6%) and Golden Retriever (51.9%). This is the first report of the epidemiology of canine obesity in China.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nam, Eunryel</author><author>Takahashi, Ayaka</author><author>Fujita, Naoki</author><author>Tsuzuki, Keiko</author><author>Nishimura, Ryohei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cultivation of corneal epithelial cell sheets on canine amniotic membrane.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>263-268</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>3T3 Cells</keyword><keyword>Amnion</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelium, Corneal</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23067315</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2012.01070.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess canine corneal epithelial cell sheets cultivated  from limbal stem cells on amniotic membrane. PROCEDURES: Canine corneal limbal segments were obtained from six beagle dogs. Cryopreserved denuded amniotic membranes (obtained from Miniature Dachshund and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breeds) from which the epithelial cells were removed were used as scaffolds. The limbal segments were cultured on these amniotic membranes with 3T3 feeder cells for 2 weeks. The harvested corneal epithelial cell sheets were stained with H&amp;E for histologic analysis. The harvested sheets were analyzed immunohistochemically using a corneal epithelium-specific marker keratin 3(K3) and putative stem cell markers ABCG2, p63, and vimentin. RESULTS: Cultivated cells from the corneal limbal tissues reached confluency in 7-8 days. The cultivated cells adhered to the denuded amniotic membrane and formed a sheet. The cultivated cell sheet was transparent and consisted of five to eight layers. K3 was observed in all layers and ABCG2, p63, and vimentin were notably present in the basal layer of the cultivated canine epithelium by immunofluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Canine corneal epithelial cells were successfully cultivated on the canine amniotic membrane. The cultivated epithelial sheets contained putative stem cells in the basal layer and had a stratified epithelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piperisova, Ida</author><author>Neel, Jennifer A</author><author>Papich, Mark G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is your diagnosis?

The dog had been receiving potassium citrate capsules to acidify urine for the past 2 years because of an earlier history of urolithiasis. Results of neurologic examination, spinal cord radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and spinal cord revealed no lesions that could have accounted for the neurologic signs. The main abnormalities on a clinical chemistry profile were marked hyperchloremia (179 mmol/L, reference interval 108-122 mmol/L) and an anion gap of -50.4 mmol/L (reference interval 16.3-28.6 mmol/L). Because of the severe hyperchloremia, serum bromide concentration was measured (400 mg/dL; toxic concentration &gt;150 mg/dL; some dogs may tolerate up to 300 mg/dL). Analysis of the potassium citrate capsules, which had been compounded at a local pharmacy, yielded a mean bromide concentration of 239 mg/capsule. Administration of the capsules was discontinued and there was rapid resolution of the dog's neurologic signs. This case of extreme bromide toxicity, which apparently resulted from inadvertent use of bromide instead of citrate at the pharmacy, illustrates the importance of knowing common interferents with analyte methodologies and of pursing logical additional diagnostic tests based on clinical and laboratory evidence, even when a patient's history appears to rule out a potential etiology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mosing, Martina</author><author>Iff, Isabelle</author><author>Moens, Yves</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endoscopic removal of a bronchial carcinoma in a dog using one-lung ventilation.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>222-225</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Anesthesia, General</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Bronchogenic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocoagulation</keyword><keyword>Intubation, Intratracheal</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Respiration, Artificial</keyword><keyword>Thoracic Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>instrumentation</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18394067</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950X.2008.00369.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe anesthetic management of endoscopic electrosurgical  removal of a bronchial carcinoma, partially blocking the right main stem bronchus in a Cocker Spaniel. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical case report. ANIMALS: Dog with a bronchial carcinoma. METHODS: To allow sufficient space for the endoscope and to avoid an oxygen-rich gas mixture in the trachea, which carries the risk of an airway fire when electrocautery is used, a 1 lumen endobronchial tube (EBT) was inserted into the left main stem bronchus. One-lung ventilation (OLV) started with a volume-controlled ventilator was switched to pressure-controlled ventilation in combination with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). RESULTS: Resection of the bronchial carcinoma was successful. The dog was hypercapnic throughout the procedure and a high alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was measured. CONCLUSION: An EBT may be a feasible and safe option to provide OLV for bronchoscopic electrocautery with a closed thoracic cavity in dogs.

Dogs from kennel 1 (n = 86) were grouped as having idiopathic cardiomyopathy (n = 19), autoimmune or other disease (n = 7) or being clinically normal (n = 60). Dogs from kennel 2 (n = 27) were all clinically normal and used for comparative purposes. There was a high incidence of serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) amongst all groups from kennel 1 (39/82 dogs tested), with anti-thyroglobulin and anti-erythrocyte antibodies also recorded in a dog with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thirty percent of dogs with idiopathic cardiomyopathy had anti-mitochondrial antibody. Thirteen dogs from kennel 1 had reduced serum IgA (&lt; or = 0.3 mg/ml), but there was no consistent abnormality in the concentration of serum IgG, IgM, complement C3 or C4 in these thirteen dogs, or other dogs from this kennel. No immunological abnormality was recorded in dogs from kennel 2. Pedigree analysis of dogs from kennel 1 revealed inheritance of autoimmune disease, serum ANA and low serum IgA within several breeding lines.

Computed tomography (CT) in English Springer Spaniel elbows has allowed identification of humeral intracondylar fissures (HIF), which can cause lameness and predispose to condylar fractures. This study aimed to evaluate CT characteristics of non-lame French Bulldog elbows, to determine the presence of underlying elbow disease. STUDY DESIGN:  Retrospective evaluation of CT images from elbows of non-lame French Bulldogs from scans obtained for soft tissue or neurological evaluation was performed. Images were evaluated for the presence of HIF and other elbow abnormalities: condylar and supracondylar remodelling, humeral condylar sclerosis, elbow incongruency, medial coronoid process disease and elbow osteoarthritis. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Computed tomographic scans from 37 dogs (74 elbows) were reviewed. No HIF were identified, although 28/74 elbows had an intracondylar sclerotic band. Medial coronoid process disease was noted in 16/74 elbows, and small osteophytes were present in 21/74 elbows, suggesting a degree of subclinical elbow disease. Widening of the caudolateral aspect of the radial incisure was identified (37/74) as a breed normal. Elbow incongruency was otherwise rare. CONCLUSION:  Non-lame French Bulldogs showed a low prevalence of occult elbow disease but a proportion had radial incisure widening. Although humeral intracondylar sclerosis was present in over a third of dogs, no HIF were identified and therefore no clear cause for their increased risk of humeral condylar fracture was identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cetlová, Veronika</author><author>Zozomová-Lihová, Judita</author><author>Melichárková, Andrea</author><author>Mártonfiová, Lenka</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple Drivers of High Species Diversity and Endemism Among Alyssum Annuals in  the Mediterranean: The Evolutionary Significance of the Aegean Hotspot.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in plant science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in plant science</full-title></periodical><pages>627909</pages><volume>12</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33986760</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpls.2021.627909</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The Mediterranean Basin is a significant hotspot of species diversity and  endemism, with various distribution patterns and speciation mechanisms observed in its flora. High species diversity in the Mediterranean is also manifested in the monophyletic lineage of Alyssum annuals (Brassicaceae), but little is known about its origin. These species include both diploids and polyploids that grow mainly in open and disturbed sites across a wide elevational span and show contrasting distribution patterns, ranging from broadly distributed Eurasian species to narrow island endemics. Here, we investigated the evolution of European representatives of this lineage, and aimed to reconstruct their phylogeny, polyploid and genome size evolution using flow cytometric analyses, chloroplast and nuclear high- and low-copy DNA markers. The origin and early diversification of the studied Alyssum lineage could be dated back to the Late Miocene/Pliocene and were likely promoted by the onset of the Mediterranean climate, whereas most of the extant species originated during the Pleistocene. The Aegean region represents a significant diversity center, as it hosts 12 out of 16 recognized European species and comprises several (sub)endemics placed in distinct phylogenetic clades. Because several species, including the closest relatives, occur here sympatrically without apparent niche differences, we can reject simple allopatric speciation via vicariance as well as ecological speciation for most cases. Instead, we suggest scenarios of more complex speciation processes that involved repeated range shifts in response to sea-level changes and recurrent land connections and disconnections since the Pliocene. In addition, multiple polyploidization events significantly contributed to species diversity across the entire distribution range. All seven polyploids, representing both widespread species and endemics to the western or eastern Mediterranean, were inferred to be allopolyploids. Finally, the current distribution patterns have likely been affected also by the human factor (farming and grazing). This study illustrates the complexity of evolutionary and speciation processes in the Mediterranean flora.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freiberger, Katharina</author><author>Hemker, Shelby</author><author>McAnally, Ryan</author><author>King, Rachel</author><author>Meyers-Wallen, Vicki N</author><author>Schutte, Brian C</author><author>Fyfe, John C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secondary Palate Development in the Dog (Canis lupus familiaris).</title><secondary-title>The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American  Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American  Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association</full-title></periodical><pages>230-236</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cleft Palate</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fetus</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Palate</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Wolves</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32705901</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1055665620943771</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gestational timing of morphologic events in normal  canine secondary palate development as a baseline for studies in dog models of isolated cleft palate (CP). METHODS: Beagle and beagle/cocker spaniel-hybrid fetal dogs were obtained by cesarean-section on various days of gestation, timed from the initial rise of serum progesterone concentration. Morphology of fetal heads was determined by examining serial coronal sections. RESULTS: On gestational day 35 (d35), the palatal shelves pointed ventrally alongside the tongue. On d36, palatal shelves were elongated and elevated to a horizontal position above the tongue but were not touching. On d37, palatine shelves and vomer were touching, but the medial epithelial seam (MES) between the apposed shelves remained. Immunostaining with epithelial protein markers showed that the MES gradually dissolved and was replaced by mesenchyme during d37-d44, and palate fusion was complete by d44. Examination of remnant MES suggested that fusion of palatal shelves began in mid-palate and moved rostrally and caudally. CONCLUSION: Palate development occurs in dogs in the steps described in humans and mice, but palate closure occurs at an intermediate time in gestation. These normative data will form the basis of future studies to determine pathophysiologic mechanisms in dog models of CP. Added clinical significance is the enhancement of dogs as a large animal model to test new approaches for palate repair, with the obvious advantage of achieving full maturity within 2 years rather than 2 decades.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kent, Marc</author><author>Talarico, Lauren R</author><author>Glass, Eric N</author><author>de Lahunta, Alexander</author><author>Platt, Simon R</author><author>Haley, Allison C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Denervation of the Tensor Veli Palatini Muscle and Effusion in the Tympanic  Cavity.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>424-428</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cranial Nerve Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Denervation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Facial Muscles</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Mandibular Nerve</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pharynx</keyword><keyword>Trigeminal Nerve</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>innervation</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26535464</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6314</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An English springer spaniel was presented for right-sided atrophy of the muscles  of mastication, analgesia and paralysis of the face, and vestibular dysfunction. Neurological signs were consistent with a lesion involving the pons and rostral medulla resulting in deficits in the function of the trigeminal, facial, and vestibular nerves. MRI disclosed a right-sided extraparenchymal mass consistent with a trigeminal nerve sheath neoplasm that was compressing and invading the pons and medulla. Atrophy of the muscles of mastication, innervated by the trigeminal nerve, was also observed on MRI. Additionally, effusion was present in the ipsilateral tympanic cavity. Gross and microscopic evaluation of the right tensor veli palatini muscle (TVPM) was consistent with neurogenic atrophy. Effusion in the tympanic cavity was likely the result of an inability to open the auditory tube as a consequence of paralysis of the TVPM. Without the ability to open the auditory tube, gases present within the auditory tube and tympanic cavity may be absorbed, creating a negative pressure environment that leads to fluid transudation and effusion build up. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to document neurogenic atrophy of the TVPM with concurrent effusion in the ipsilateral tympanic cavity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, R B</author><author>Vite, C H</author><author>Bradley, C W</author><author>Cross, J R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postmortem evaluation of 435 cases of intracranial neoplasia in dogs and  relationship of neoplasm with breed, age, and body weight.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1143-1152</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Brain Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23865437</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12136</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Intracranial neoplasia of dogs is frequently encountered in  veterinary medicine, but large-scale studies on prevalence are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of intracranial neoplasia in a large population of dogs examined postmortem and the relationship between breed, age, and weight with the presence of primary intracranial neoplasms. ANIMALS: All dogs that underwent postmortem examination from 1986 through 2010 (n = 9,574), including dogs with a histopathologic diagnosis of primary (n = 227) and secondary (n = 208) intracranial neoplasia. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of medical records from 1986 through 2010. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of intracranial neoplasia in this study's population of dogs was 4.5%. A statistically significant higher prevalence of primary intracranial neoplasms was found in dogs with increasing age and body weights. Dogs ≥15 kg had an increased risk of meningioma (odds ratio 2.3) when compared to dogs &lt;15 kg. The Boxer, Boston Terrier, Golden Retriever, French Bulldog, and Rat Terrier had a significantly increased risk of primary intracranial neoplasms while the Cocker Spaniel and Doberman Pinscher showed a significantly decreased risk of primary intracranial neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Intracranial neoplasia in dogs might be more common than previous estimates. The study suggests that primary intracranial neoplasia should be a strong differential in older and larger breed dogs presenting with signs of nontraumatic intracranial disease. Specific breeds have been identified with an increased risk, and others with a decreased risk of primary intracranial neoplasms. The results warrant future investigations into the role of age, size, genetics, and breed on the development of intracranial neoplasms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strain, G M</author><author>Clark, L A</author><author>Wahl, J M</author><author>Turner, A E</author><author>Murphy, K E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of deafness in dogs heterozygous or homozygous for the merle allele.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>282-286</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Deafness</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19192156</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0257.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Deafness in dogs is frequently associated with the pigment genes  piebald and merle. Little is known about the prevalence of deafness in dogs carrying the merle allele. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of deafness in dogs heterozygous and homozygous for the merle allele of the mouse Silver pigment locus homolog (SILV) gene. ANIMALS: One hundred and fifty-three privately owned merle dogs of different breeds and both sexes. METHODS: Hearing was tested by brainstem auditory-evoked response and classified as bilaterally hearing, unilaterally deaf, or bilaterally deaf. DNA from buccal cells was genotyped as either heterozygous or homozygous for the merle allele. Deafness association tests among merle genotype, eye color, and sex were performed by the chi(2) test. RESULTS: Deafness prevalence in merles overall was 4.6% unilaterally deaf and 4.6% bilaterally deaf. There was a significant association between hearing status and heterozygous versus homozygous merle genotype. For single merles (Mm), 2.7% were unilaterally deaf and 0.9% were bilaterally deaf. For double merles (MM), 10% were unilaterally deaf and 15% were bilaterally deaf. There was no significant association with eye color or sex. CONCLUSIONS: Deafness prevalence in merle dogs was greater than that in some dog breeds homozygous for the piebald gene, such as the English Cocker Spaniel, but comparable to, or lower than, that in the Dalmatian and white Bull Terrier. Dogs homozygous for the merle allele were significantly more likely to be deaf than heterozygotes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eayrs, Matthew K</author><author>Guerin, Vincent</author><author>Grierson, James</author><author>Moores, Andrew P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Repair of Fractures of the Lateral Aspect of the Humeral Condyle in Skeletally  Mature Dogs with Locking and Non-Locking Plates.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>419-426</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Plates</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fracture Fixation, Internal</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34571544</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/s-0041-1735552</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome and  complications following transcondylar screw and epicondylar plate fixation of skeletally mature dogs with fractures of the lateral aspect of the humeral condyle using a string of pearls, limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) or locking compression plate (LCP). STUDY DESIGN:  This study was a retrospective review of clinical records, radiographic images and canine brief pain inventory evaluation with a supplementary non-validated questionnaire. RESULTS:  Thirty-one fractures in 29 dogs were included. The majority of dogs were Spaniels (23/29). Thirty fractures had evidence of humeral intracondylar fissure. Sixteen fractures had string of pearls, eight LCP and seven LC-DCP. There were two minor complications and three major complications. Perioperative (median: 6 weeks, range: 6-12) outcome was considered fully functional for 24 fractures and acceptable for 6 fractures. One dog had an unacceptable outcome due to the failure of an LCP that healed following revision surgery. Fractures with radiographic follow-up had a persistent visible intracondylar fracture line in 20/26. Twenty-six of twenty-seven owners perceived an excellent outcome (median: 135 weeks, range: 25-246). CONCLUSION:  Repair of fractures of the lateral aspect of the humeral condyle with a transcondylar screw and epicondylar plate has a good perioperative, mid- and long-term outcome with 10% major complication rate, despite incomplete or non-union of the intracondylar fracture in 20/26 elbows.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kutsunai, M</author><author>Kanemoto, H</author><author>Fukushima, K</author><author>Fujino, Y</author><author>Ohno, K</author><author>Tsujimoto, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The association between gall bladder mucoceles and hyperlipidaemia in dogs: a  retrospective case control study.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>76-79</pages><volume>199</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gallbladder Diseases</keyword><keyword>Hyperlipidemias</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mucocele</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24268484</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.10.019</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The diagnosis of gall bladder mucoceles (GM) in dogs has become increasingly  frequent in veterinary medicine. Primary breed-specific hyperlipidaemia is reported in Shetland Sheepdogs and Miniature Schnauzers, breeds in which GM are known to occur more frequently than in other breeds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between GM and hyperlipidaemia in dogs. The study design was a retrospective case control study. Medical records of dogs diagnosed with GM at the Veterinary Medical Centre of The University of Tokyo between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2012, were reviewed. Fifty-eight dogs with GM and a record of either serum cholesterol, triglyceride, or glucose concentrations were included in the study. Hypercholesterolaemia (15/37 cases; odds ratio [OR]: 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-8.36) and hypertriglyceridaemia (13/24 cases; OR: 3.55; 95% CI:1.12-15.91) showed significant association with GM. Pomeranians (OR: 10.69), American Cocker Spaniels (OR: 8.94), Shetland Sheepdogs (OR: 6.21), Miniature Schnauzers (OR: 5.23), and Chihuahuas (OR: 3.06) were significantly predisposed to GM. Thirty-nine out of 58 cases had at least one concurrent disease, including pancreatitis (five cases), hyperadrenocorticism (two cases), and hypothyroidism (two cases). A significant association between GM and hyperlipidaemia was confirmed, suggesting that hyperlipidaemia may play a role in the pathogenesis of GM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Marra, Shana K</author><author>Delaforcade, Armelle M</author><author>Shaw, Scott P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treatment and predictors of outcome in dogs with immune-mediated  thrombocytopenia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>346-352</pages><volume>238</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenal Cortex Hormones</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gastrointestinal Agents</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21281218</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.238.3.346</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical course of disease and identify prognostic  indicators for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS: 73 dogs treated for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia at the Foster Hospital for Small Animals at the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine and the Tufts Veterinary Emergency Treatment and Specialties Hospital. PROCEDURES: Medical records from the period of January 2002 through June 2008 were reviewed to identify dogs with a diagnosis of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Data collected included signalment, clinical signs, results of initial diagnostic tests, treatment, complications, and survival duration. RESULTS: Dog ages ranged from 5 months to 15 years (median, 8.1 years). Cocker Spaniels were overrepresented, compared with their distribution in the entire hospital population during the same period. Sixty-one of the 73 (84%) dogs survived to discharge. Seven (11 %) of those dogs were lost to follow-up. Five of the remaining 54 (9%) dogs had a relapse of the disease. The presence of melena or high BUN concentration at admission to the hospital was significantly correlated with a decreased probability of survival. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is a serious yet treatable disease, which may have a lower rate of recurrence than previously reported. The presence of melena or high BUN concentration in the study suggested a poor prognosis for affected dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, P J</author><author>Archer, J</author><author>Roulois, A J</author><author>Scase, T J</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observational study of 14 cases of chronic pancreatitis in dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>968-976</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>25</issue><keywords><keyword>Abdominal Pain</keyword><keyword>Amylases</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol</keyword><keyword>Clinical Enzyme Tests</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Complications</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Gastrointestinal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Lipase</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Trypsin</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>21262713</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.c4912</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study reports the clinical, clinicopathological and ultrasonographic  findings from dogs with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Fourteen dogs with clinical signs consistent with CP and histological confirmation of the disease were evaluated. Abdominal ultrasound and clinical pathology results were recorded. Sensitivities of pancreatic enzymes for diagnosis of CP were calculated with two different cut-off values. The mean age of affected dogs was 9.1 years. Spaniels were the most common breed with CP, representing seven of the 14 dogs in this study. CP was histologically severe in nine cases. Most dogs showed chronic low-grade gastrointestinal signs and abdominal pain. Five dogs had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and five dogs had diabetes mellitus. The sensitivity of elevated trypsin-like immunoreactivity for CP was 17 per cent. The sensitivities of canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, lipase and amylase for CP were 44 to 67 per cent or 14 to 28 per cent depending on the cut-off value used. Cholesterol was elevated in 58 per cent of samples. Liver enzymes were often elevated. The pancreas appeared abnormal on 56 per cent of ultrasound examinations. Ten dogs had died by the end of the study period; only one case was due to CP.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ko, Jaeeun</author><author>Hwang, Jeongyeon</author><author>Yoon, Hakyoung</author><author>Eom, Kidong</author><author>Kim, Jaehwan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Case Report: Multimodal Imaging Features of Pedunculated Liver Masses in Seven  Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>581922</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33330705</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2020.581922</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study describes the multimodal imaging characteristics of pedunculated liver  masses in seven dogs [Cocker Spaniel (n = 2), Maltese (n = 1), Shih-Tzu (n = 2), and Schnauzer (n = 2)]. These masses are anatomic variants of hepatic masses in which the center of the mass lies outside the liver contour. Prior to referral, only one dog had been diagnosed with a hepatic mass, four had been diagnosed with mid-abdominal masses of unknown origin, and two had been misdiagnosed with splenic head and pancreatic masses. Using radiographs, the mass locations were classified as cranioventral (n = 3), mid-abdominal (n = 2), or craniodorsal (n = 2). The gastric axis was deviated in various directions in four cases. Based on computed tomography (CT) findings, the masses were noted to originate from every liver lobe (two from the left lateral lobe) and to possess parenchymal (n = 6) or vascular (n = 1) pedicles. The histopathological results showed that three masses were benign [hepatic adenoma (n = 1) and nodular hyperplasia (n = 2)] and four were malignant [hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 3) and cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1)]. For three dogs, triple-phase CT maximum intensity projection images in the arterial phase clearly showed that the masses were connected to the hepatic artery. We propose that a pedunculated liver mass should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a mass is located in the mid-abdomen, even if it is separated from the liver and with the gastric axis deviated in various directions. We consider CT imaging to be a useful tool for diagnosis, evaluation, and surgical planning in dogs with a pedunculated liver mass.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kunz, Brittany C</author><author>Center, Sharon A</author><author>Randolph, John F</author><author>Walker, Janelle D</author><author>Choi, April E</author><author>Anderson, Karl E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria and protoporphyric hepatopathy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1148-1156</pages><volume>257</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bile</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Protoporphyria, Erythropoietic</keyword><keyword>Ursodeoxycholic Acid</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33226294</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2020.257.11.1148</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-month-old sexually intact male Clumber Spaniel was  evaluated because of small stature, recurrent dermatitis of the head, and progressive pigmentary hepatopathy. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Clinicopathologic findings included nonanemic hypochromic microcytosis, hypocholesterolemia, persistently high serum liver enzyme activities, and anicteric hyperbilirubinemia. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens collected when the dog was 6 months and 2 years of age revealed expansion and bridging of portal tracts, occasional centrilobular parenchymal collapse, scattered lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and dark red to brown pigment within large aggregates of macrophages, engorged bile canaliculi, and hepatocytes. The pigment failed to stain for the presence of iron, copper, bile, and glycoprotein and, when examined with polarized microscopy, emitted a yellow to green birefringence with occasional Maltese cross configurations. Further analyses confirmed marked porphyrin accumulation in blood, urine, feces, and liver tissue; protoporphyrin accumulation in RBCs and liver tissue; and a signature porphyrin profile and fluorescence peak consistent with erythropoietic protoporphyria. Advanced protoporphyric hepatopathy was diagnosed. The chronic dermatopathy was presumed to reflect protoporphyric photosensitivity. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Management was focused on avoiding conditions known to induce heme synthesis and catabolism, administrating ursodeoxycholic acid and antioxidants S-adenosylmethionine and vitamin E, and avoiding sunlight exposure. At follow-up at 4 years of age, the dog was stable without evidence of jaundice but with probable persistent erythropoietic protoporphyria-related solar dermatopathy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical and histologic features of congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria and resultant protoporphyric hepatopathy, the diagnosis, and the successful management of a dog with these conditions over 4 years were described. Veterinarians should consider porphyric syndromes when unusual pigmentary hepatopathies are encountered.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Medina Valentin, Anyela Andrea</author><author>Gavazza, Alessandra</author><author>Lubas, George</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of Dog Erythrocyte Antigen 1 in 7,414 Dogs in Italy.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine international</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine international</full-title></periodical><pages>5914629</pages><volume>2017</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29147599</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2017/5914629</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The study aim was to establish the prevalence of DEA 1, the most immunogenic and  clinically important blood group in canine blood transfusion, in 7,414 dogs from Italy. The potential sensitization risk following a first transfusion and the acute reaction risk following a second transfusion given without a cross-matching and blood typing test were also calculated. Dogs tested were purebred (4,798) and mongrel (2,616); 38.8% were DEA 1 negative and 61.2% were DEA 1 positive. High prevalence for DEA 1 positive blood type was found in Ariegeois and English Setter, whereas German Shepherd and Boxer had higher DEA 1 negative blood type. Breeds with blood type never reported before included French Brittany Spaniel and Pug showing a high prevalence of DEA 1 positive type, while French Bulldog and West Highland White Terrier were more often DEA 1 negative. Just 48.8% of purebred and 13.9% of mongrel dogs were considered as prospective blood donors based upon their blood type. Most of the breeds had a sensitization risk of 20.0-25.0%. Rottweiler and Ariegeois had less risk of sensitization (9.4 and 4.2%) and the minor risk of an acute transfusional reaction (0.9-0.2%). The prevalence of DEA 1 positive and negative dogs in Italy agrees with most of the data already reported in the literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>German, Alexander J</author><author>Blackwell, Emily</author><author>Evans, Mark</author><author>Westgarth, Carri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overweight dogs exercise less frequently and for shorter periods: results of a  large online survey of dog owners from the UK.</title><secondary-title>Journal of nutritional science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of nutritional science</full-title></periodical><pages>e11</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28620486</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/jns.2017.6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine obesity is now the number one health concern in dogs worldwide. Regular  physical activity can improve health, and owners are advised to exercise their dogs on a regular basis. However, limited information exists about associations between overweight status of dogs and walking activity. An online survey was conducted between June and August in 2014, coinciding with the broadcast of a national UK television programme, exploring dog behaviour. Information gathered included signalment, overweight status, and owner-reported information on duration and frequency of dog walking. The University of Liverpool Ethics Committee approved the project, and owners consented to data use. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations between overweight status and dog walking activity. Data were available from 11 154 adult dogs, and 1801 (16·1 %) of these were reported as overweight by their owners. Dogs reported to be overweight dogs were more likely to be neutered (P &lt; 0·0001) and older (P &lt; 0·0001). Various breeds were over-represented including beagle, Cavalier King Charles spaniel, golden retriever, Labrador retriever and pug (P &lt; 0·0001 for all). Both frequency and duration of walking were negatively associated with overweight status (P &lt; 0·0001 for both). On multiple regression analysis, duration and frequency were independently and negatively associated with the odds of being overweight, along with a range of other factors including age, neuter status and breed. This study has identified associations between overweight status and exercise. In the future, studies should determine the reason for this association, and whether changes in walking activity can influence weight status.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mullins, Ronan A</author><author>Guerin, Shane R</author><author>Pratschke, Kathryn M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of a split-thickness soft palate hinged flap and bilateral buccal mucosal  rotation flaps for one-stage repair of a bilateral hypoplastic soft palate in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>91-95</pages><volume>248</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Palate, Soft</keyword><keyword>Plastic Surgery Procedures</keyword><keyword>Surgical Flaps</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26684096</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.248.1.91</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 14-week-old 8.5-kg (18.7-lb) sexually intact female Springer  Spaniel was evaluated because of chronic rhinitis with bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. The dog had a history since birth of sneezing and oronasal reflux of food and liquid. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Oral examination under anesthesia revealed a short, incompletely formed soft palate with bilateral clefts. A pseudouvula was not a prominent feature of the condition in this dog. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The dog underwent 1-stage reconstruction of the soft palate by means of a split-thickness soft palate hinged flap and bilateral buccal mucosal rotation flaps. Long-term follow-up obtained 3 years after surgery revealed the dog to be in good general health, with resolution of oronasal reflux; however, occasional episodes of mild sneezing and nasal discharge persisted. Oral examination under sedation revealed attenuation of the bilateral clefts; however, a normal soft palate length was not achieved. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Compared with previously described techniques, this technique offered the possibility of 1-stage reconstruction of the soft palate in dogs, rather than having 2 staged procedures performed, and a robust tissue combination that was expected to be less prone to trauma. This technique may be particularly suitable for affected dogs where a pseudouvula is not a prominent feature and appears to be applicable to a variety of skull morphologies. Owners should be made aware that the absence of normal palatine muscle within the reconstructed palate may affect function, but even where normal function is not regained, a good quality of life with minimal clinical signs may be achieved.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, Naoki</author><author>Uchida, Kazuyuki</author><author>Kanemoto, Hideyuki</author><author>Ohno, Koichi</author><author>Chambers, James K</author><author>Nakayama, Hiroyuki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A retrospective histopathological survey on canine and feline liver diseases at  the University of Tokyo between 2006 and 2012.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>1015-1020</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Japan</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24717415</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1292/jvms.14-0083</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>To determine the incidence of hepatic diseases in dogs and cats in Japan, a  retrospective study was performed using data of 463 canine and 71 feline liver biopsies at the Veterinary Medical Center of the University of Tokyo. The most common canine hepatic disease was microvascular dysplasia (MVD) and occupied 29.4% of all diagnoses. This terminology might contain &quot;real&quot; MVD and primary portal vein hypoplasia, because these two conditions were difficult to be clearly distinguished histopathologically. Parenchymal and interstitial hepatitis and primary hepatic tumors accounted for 23.5% and 21.0% of the diagnoses, respectively. Parenchymal and interstitial hepatitis occupied 34.1% of non-proliferative canine hepatic diseases, while hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma were 26.6% and 24.5% of proliferative hepatic diseases, respectively. Breed-specificity was seen in MVD for Yorkshire terrier, Papillon and Toy poodle, in hepatitis for Doberman pinscher and Labrador retriever, in cholangiohepatitis for American cocker spaniel, Miniature schnauzer and Pomeranian, in hepatocellular adenoma for Golden retriever and Shiba and in hepatocellular carcinoma for Shih Tzu. The most common feline liver disease was parenchymal and interstitial hepatitis (45.1% of all diagnoses). Among feline hepatitis, neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis (23.9%), lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis (14.1%) and chronic hepatitis (5.6%) were recorded. Adult polycystic liver disease was 5.6%. Among proliferative diseases in the feline liver (11.3% of the all), lymphoma (4.2%) and primary epithelial tumors (4.2%) including hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular adenoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma were observed. Hepatic degeneration was 14.1%, and MVD was 12.7%, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zarelli, Micaela</author><author>Schwarz, Tobias</author><author>Puggioni, Antonella</author><author>Pinilla, Manuel</author><author>O'Doherty, John V</author><author>McAllister, Hester</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An optimized protocol for multislice computed tomography of the canine brain.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>387-392</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Multidetector Computed Tomography</keyword><keyword>Veterinary Medicine</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24506077</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.12144</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used in veterinary practice to evaluate dogs  with suspected brain disease, however contrast resolution limitations and artifacts may reduce visualization of clinically important anatomic features. The purpose of this study was to develop an optimized CT protocol for evaluating the canine brain. The head of a 5-year-old Springer Spaniel with no neurological signs was imaged immediately following euthanasia using a 4-slice CT scanner and 282 protocols. Each protocol used a fixed tube voltage of 120 kVp and 10 cm display field of view. Other acquisition and reconstruction parameters were varied. For each protocol, four selected images of the brain were reconstructed, anonymized and saved in DICOM format. Three board-certified veterinary radiologists independently reviewed each of the four images for each protocol and recorded a numerical quality score for each image. The protocol yielding the lowest total numerical score was defined as the optimal protocol. There was overall agreement that the optimal protocol was the one with the following parameters: sequential mode, 300 mAs, 1 mm slice thickness, 1 s tube rotation time, medium image reconstruction algorithm and applied beam hardening correction. Sequential imaging provided optimal image resolution. The thin-sliced images provided a small blur due to partial volume artifacts. A high tube current resulted in a relatively low noise level. Use of a medium frequency image reconstruction algorithm provided optimal contrast resolution for brain tissue. Use of a proprietary beam hardening correction filter (Posterior Fossa Optimization) markedly reduced beam-hardening artifact.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patil, N</author><author>Abba, M</author><author>Hödl, P</author><author>Schwarzbach, M</author><author>Allgayer, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A real time PCR based approach for the quantitative detection of FUS-CHOP fusion  transcripts in human liposarcoma.</title><secondary-title>Advances in medical sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in medical sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>37-45</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>In Vitro Techniques</keyword><keyword>Liposarcoma</keyword><keyword>Oncogene Proteins, Fusion</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>RNA-Binding Protein FUS</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factor CHOP</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22543255</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/v10039-012-0018-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: Histology still forms the backbone for the diagnosis of the myxoid and  round cell subtypes of liposarcoma but the molecular identification of the different transcript variants remains a challenge, due, in part, to the complexity of multiple overlapping exons that they share between them. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a more sensitive platform than existing semi-quantitative approaches for detecting FUS-CHOP transcripts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present investigation we describe a novel approach using real-time PCR to identify and differentiate the fusion transcripts formed in the t(12; 16)(q13; p11) chromosomal translocation. This method is founded on the basis of transcript individualized primers and probes, which were designed to detect specifically the different variants in both frozen and FFPE tissues. RESULTS: Our results show that the method is highly specific, sensitive, and superior to the widely used nested PCR approach, and is accurately able to differentiate the most common variants, as well as quantify copy numbers. Primer amplification and probe detection of FUS-CHOP from genomic DNA of human, mouse, cocker spaniel and chicken sources all resulted in completely negative results indicating this technique is specific for human RNA derived transcripts. CONCLUSION: This new method offers an additional tool in the investigation of liposarcoma that may impact considerably on missed diagnosis and it's accompanying clinical ramifications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ginel, P J</author><author>Blanco, B</author><author>Lucena, R</author><author>Jiménez, C R</author><author>Peinado-Guitart, C</author><author>Mozos, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Steroid-sparing effect of mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of a  subepidermal blistering autoimmune disease in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the South African Veterinary Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the South African Veterinary Association</full-title></periodical><pages>253-257</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal</keyword><keyword>Autoimmune Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Mycophenolic Acid</keyword><keyword>Prednisone</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>21526742</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4102/jsava.v81i4.157</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7-year-old female Cocker spaniel-cross was referred with an 8-month history of  mucocutaneous erosive dermatitis. On physical examination, skin lesions affected the eyelids and periocular area, lips and vulva. Lesions were symmetrical with small diffuse superficial ulcers, haemorrhagic crusts, adherent purulent exudation in haired skin, and alopecia with hyperpigmentation and scarring. Histopathologic evaluation showed multiple, non-intact dermoepidermal junction vesicles and ulceration associated with a dermal lichenoid infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry showed strong to moderate reactivity in the dermoepidermal junction for the antibodies directed against canine IgG, human IgG lambda light chains and C3, respectively. A diagnosis of autoimmune subepidermal blistering dermatosis was made. Treatment with oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at 20 mg/kg twice daily was initiated and after 4 weeks the ulcers and erosions were cured. During the rest of treatment, MMF was maintained at 10 mg/kg twice daily and prednisone could be tapered to 0.25 mg/kg once every other day without recurrences. In conclusion, this case report shows that MMF was well tolerated and might be effective as steroid-sparing agent in the long-term treatment of this autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Šlenker, Marek</author><author>Melichárková, Andrea</author><author>Caboňová, Michaela</author><author>Šandalová, Michaela</author><author>Zeisek, Vojtěch</author><author>Marhold, Karol</author><author>Zozomová-Lihová, Judita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenetic challenges in a recently diversified and polyploid-rich Alyssum  (Brassicaceae) lineage: low divergence, reticulation and parallel polyploid speciation.</title><secondary-title>Evolution; international journal of organic evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evolution; international journal of organic evolution</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36820521</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/evolut/qpad035</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Elucidating the evolution of recently diverged and polyploid-rich plant lineages  may be challenging even with high-throughput sequencing, both for biological reasons and bioinformatic difficulties. Here, we apply target enrichment with genome skimming (Hyb-Seq) to unravel the evolutionary history of the Alyssum montanum-A. repens species complex. Reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships in diploids supported recent and rapid diversification accompanied by reticulation events. Of the four main clades identified among the diploids, three clades included species from the Alps, Apennine and Balkan peninsulas, indicating close biogeographic links between these regions. We further focused on the clade distributed from the Western Alps to the Iberian Peninsula, which comprises numerous polyploids as opposed to a few diploids. Using a recently developed PhyloSD (phylogenomic subgenome detection) pipeline, we successfully tracked the ancestry of all polyploids. We inferred multiple polyploidization events that involved two closely related diploid progenitors, resulting into several sibling polyploids: two autopolyploids and six allopolyploids. The skewed proportions of major homeolog-types and the occurrence of some minor homeolog-types, both exhibiting geographic patterns, suggest introgression with the progenitors and other related diploids. Our study highlights a unique case of parallel polyploid speciation that was enhanced by ecological and geographic separation and provides an excellent resource for future studies of polyploid evolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Travail, Victoria</author><author>Cianciolo, Rachel E</author><author>Peak, Kerry</author><author>Di Bella, Andrea</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mycophenolate mofetil and telmisartan for the treatment of proteinuria secondary  to minimal change disease podocytopathy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2187-2190</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Kidney Glomerulus</keyword><keyword>Mycophenolic Acid</keyword><keyword>Nephrosis, Lipoid</keyword><keyword>Proteinuria</keyword><keyword>Telmisartan</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36151875</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16534</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-year-old entire female Springer Spaniel, with a previous diagnosis of  meningoencephalitis of unknown origin diagnosed 2 years before presentation and treated with long term administration of prednisolone, developed proteinuria.

STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Twenty cadavers of mesocephalic dogs. METHODS: Cosmetic reconstruction was performed after incisivectomy and nasal planectomy. Preoperative and intraoperative skull measurements included width of the nasal planum, rostral and caudal maxilla, labial flap, and maxilla at ostectomy site; the length of the nose, labial flap, and philtrum incision; lip thickness; and philtrum placement. Ratios of select width to length measurements were calculated. Correlation was tested between skull biometrics and tension during reconstruction as well as resulting opening of the nasal aperture. RESULTS: Breeds included golden retriever, pit bull, Labrador retriever, beagle, shepherd, basset hound, boxer mix, cocker spaniel, and Great Dane. No biometric ratios were predictive of procedural success. The most important objective measurements that were significantly correlated with inferior outcome included width of the nasal planum (&gt;3 cm), width of the caudal maxilla (&gt;6.2 cm), lip thickness (&gt;0.5 cm), width of the labial flap (&gt;2.9 cm), length of the incision created to make the cosmetic &quot;philtrum&quot; (longer incisions &gt;2.8 cm), and philtrum placement (more dorsal placement). CONCLUSION: Tension during reconstruction and decreased resultant nasal aperture were associated with wider facial features and thicker lips as well as directly impacted by cosmetic philtrum design and placement. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Standardized preoperative measurements may help guide clinical decision making in choosing and executing a nasal planectomy reconstructive technique.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Espinheira Gomes, Filipe N C M</author><author>Porter, Ian</author><author>Sumner, Julia P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transorbital postcaruncular endoscopic surgery as an alternative to orbital  exploratory surgery: A cadaveric study and case report in a dog with an orbital sarcoma.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>1359-1366</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cadaver</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endoscopy</keyword><keyword>Neurosurgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Orbit</keyword><keyword>Orbital Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sarcoma</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32491232</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vsu.13446</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe a postcaruncular approach for transorbital endoscopy as an  alternative, minimally invasive technique to access the orbital apex. STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo and prospective clinical case report. ANIMALS: A 12-year-old male castrated cocker spaniel and three cadaver heads (one large breed dolichocephalic, one medium-sized breed mesocephalic, and one small breed brachycephalic). METHODS: Transorbital endoscopy was performed to obtain biopsies of an orbital apex mass by using a postcaruncular approach. A 2.7-mm 30° rigid endoscope fitted with a cystoscope working sheath was used with the aid of a blunt suction-dissector and fluid ingress. This procedure was first performed on three cadavers to assess feasibility and later performed in a clinical case. RESULTS: By using a transorbital postcaruncular approach, it was possible to visualize and obtain biopsies from structures within the orbital apex with minimal perioperative morbidity. Dissection and expansion of the working space was facilitated with the aid of fluid ingress; however, judicious use of fluids is recommended because secondary orbital edema and chemosis can occur. CONCLUSION: Transorbital endoscopy via a postcaruncular approach is feasible. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This technique should be considered in cases in which a histological diagnosis is required prior to definitive treatment as a method to obtain biopsy samples of the orbital apex region without major surgical dissection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hanson, J M</author><author>Tengvall, K</author><author>Bonnett, B N</author><author>Hedhammar, Å</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Naturally Occurring Adrenocortical Insufficiency--An Epidemiological Study Based  on a Swedish-Insured Dog Population of 525,028 Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>76-84</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Addison Disease</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Insurance, Health</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26683136</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.13815</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring adrenocortical insufficiency (NOAI) in dogs is  considered an uncommon disease with good prognosis with hormonal replacement treatment. However, there are no epidemiological studies with estimates for the general dog population. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of NOAI in a large population of insured dogs. ANIMALS: Data were derived from 525,028 client-owned dogs insured by a Swedish insurance company representing 2,364,652 dog-years at risk (DYAR) during the period between 1995-2006. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Incidence rates, prevalences, and relative risks for dogs with NOAI (AI with no previous claim for hypercortisolism), were calculated for the whole dog population, and for subgroups divided by breed and sex. Mortality rates were calculated and compared in dogs with NOAI and the remaining dogs overall. RESULTS: In total 534 dogs were identified with NOAI. The overall incidence was 2.3 cases per 10,000 DYAR. The relative risk of disease was significantly higher in the Portuguese Water Dog, Standard Poodle, Bearded Collie, Cairn Terrier, and Cocker Spaniel compared with other breeds combined. Female dogs overall were at higher risk of developing AI than male dogs (RR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.55-2.22; P &lt; .001). The relative risk of death was 1.9 times higher in dogs with NOAI than in dogs overall. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The data supports the existence of breed-specific differences in incidence rates of NOAI in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harcourt-Brown, T R</author><author>Campbell, J</author><author>Warren-Smith, C</author><author>Jeffery, N D</author><author>Granger, N P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of Chiari-like malformations in clinically unaffected dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>231-237</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25319206</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12477</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The importance of Chiari-like malformation (CM) in the generation of  clinical signs or the formation of syringomyelia in dogs is incompletely understood, partly because the prevalence of various CM definitions in unaffected dogs is unknown. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aims were: to estimate the prevalence of CM in dogs asymptomatic for CM or syringomyelia, according to 3 currently used definitions; and, to investigate the effect of brachycephaly and head position during magnetic resonance (MR) imaging on estimates of the prevalence of CM. ANIMALS: One ninety-nine client-owned dogs without apparent signs of CM or syringomyelia. METHODS: Blinded, retrospective analysis. Archived MR images were analyzed for evidence of cerebellar indentation and impaction into or herniation through the foramen magnum. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship of CM diagnosis with head position and the cranial index (a measure of brachycephaly). RESULTS: In 185 non-Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs, indentation was identified in 44% (95% CI, 47-51%) and impaction in 22% (95% CI, 16-28%). No asymptomatic, non-CKCS dogs showed herniation. Regression analysis showed a significant increase in the odds of indentation and impaction in an extended head position and as the cranial index increased (became more brachycephalic). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The high prevalence of cerebellar indentation and impaction suggests that they may be normal anatomical variations and therefore unsuitable as definitions of CM. We suggest that future research into CM in dogs should define cases and controls more strictly so that overlap between normal and abnormal animals is minimized.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whitty, C C</author><author>Milner, H R</author><author>Oram, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of spinal empyema caused by a  migrating grass awn in a dog.</title><secondary-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>115-118</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Poaceae</keyword><keyword>Seeds</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Diseases</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23134153</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00480169.2012.731717</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Abstract CASE HISTORY: A 13 kg 3.5-year-old male neutered Cocker Spaniel  presented with a 6-day history of deteriorating hindlimb paresis. Approximately 10 weeks previously the owner reported removing a large number of barley grass seeds from the dog's coat and ears. Eight weeks later the dog was treated for pneumonia, based on clinical findings and thoracic radiographs. In the 4 days prior to referral the dog had a decreased appetite, was lethargic and appeared unable to urinate voluntarily. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog was bright and alert but unable to walk. Upper motor neuron signs were indicative of T3-L3 spinal lesion. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an abnormal low signal linear structure within the left T12-T13 neural foramen extending to the left lateral aspects of the thoracic spinal cord was detected, consistent with a foreign body. A left T12-T13 lateral hemilaminectomy was performed and a grass seed removed from a tract extending caudally from the T12-13 space, dorsal to the lumbar transverse processes and the rib head. The dog made a rapid recovery after surgery with full resolution of clinical signs. DIAGNOSIS: Spinal empyema caused by a migrating barley grass awn (Hordeum spp.). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Advanced imaging using MRI can bea valuable method for localising foreign bodies prior to exploratory surgery. Animals presenting with neurological signs should have foreign body reactions included as a differential diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hattersley, Rachel</author><author>McKee, Malcolm</author><author>O'Neill, Turlough</author><author>Clarke, Stephen</author><author>Butterworth, Steven</author><author>Maddox, Thomas</author><author>Owen, Martin</author><author>Langley-Hobbs, Sorrel J</author><author>Comerford, Eithne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postoperative complications after surgical management of incomplete ossification  of the humeral condyle in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>728-733</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21699552</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950X.2011.00847.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe incidence and type of postoperative complications in the  surgical management of incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle (IOHC) and identify any risk factors associated with development of these complications. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Clinical records of dogs (n=57) that had prophylactic transcondylar screw insertion for treatment of IOHC (79 elbows) at 6 UK referral centers were reviewed. Signalment, presentation, surgical management, postoperative care, and complications were recorded. Postoperative complications were divided into seroma, surgical site infections (SSI) and implant complications. RESULTS: Spaniel breeds and entire males were overrepresented. The overall complication rate was 59.5%. Seroma (n=25) and SSI (24) were the most commonly encountered complications. Implant failure occurred in 2 dogs. Labrador retrievers were at greater risk of developing a postoperative complication than other breeds (P=.03). Increasing bodyweight was a significant risk factor for development of a SSI (P=.03). Placement of the transcondylar screw in lag fashion rather than as a positional screw reduced the incidence of postoperative SSI (P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management of IOHC is associated with a high rate of postoperative complications. Placement of the transcondylar screw in lag fashion may limit postoperative complications and warrants further consideration.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gonçalves, R</author><author>Penderis, J</author><author>Chang, Y P</author><author>Zoia, A</author><author>Mosley, J</author><author>Anderson, T J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and neurological characteristics of aortic thromboembolism in dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>178-184</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aortic Diseases</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Physical Conditioning, Animal</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Thromboembolism</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18339088</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00530.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To characterise the clinical presentation and neurological  abnormalities in dogs affected by aortic thromboembolism. METHODS: The medical records of 13 dogs diagnosed with aortic thromboembolism as the cause of the clinical signs, and where a complete neurological examination was performed, were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The onset was acute in only four dogs, chronic in five dogs (with all of these presenting as exercise intolerance) or chronic with acute deterioration in four dogs. Dogs with an acute onset of clinical signs were more severely affected exhibiting neurological deficits, while dogs with a chronic onset of disease predominantly presented with the exercise intolerance and minimal deficits. The locomotor deficits included exercise intolerance with pelvic limb weakness (five of 13), pelvic limb ataxia (one of 13), monoparesis (two of 13), paraparesis (two of 13), non-ambulatory paraparesis (two of 13) and paraplegia (one of 13). There was an apparent male predisposition and the cavalier King charles spaniel was overrepresented. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The rate of onset of clinical signs appears to segregate dogs affected by aortic thromboembolism into two groups, with different clinical characteristics and outcomes. Dogs with an acute onset of the clinical signs tend to be more severely affected, while dogs with a chronic onset predominantly present with exercise intolerance. It is therefore important to consider aortic thromboembolism as a differential diagnosis in dogs with an acute onset of pelvic limb neurological deficits and in dogs with longer standing exercise intolerance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Egenvall, Agneta</author><author>Bonnett, Brenda N</author><author>Ohagen, Patrik</author><author>Olson, Pekka</author><author>Hedhammar, Ake</author><author>von Euler, Henrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence of and survival after mammary tumors in a population of over 80,000  insured female dogs in Sweden from 1995 to 2002.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>109-127</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Insurance Claim Review</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Regression Analysis</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15899300</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2005.01.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The main objective of this study was to describe the incidence of mammary tumors  (MTs) and the survival after MTs, in female dogs between 3 and 10 years of age (insured for veterinary care and with life insurance in a Swedish animal-insurance company) from 1995 to 2002. Measures of incidence are presented crudely, by breed and across age categories and birth cohorts (1991-1998). The survivals until MT diagnosis and after a MT diagnosis were computed. The overall incidence for any MT claim was 111 dogs per 10,000 dog-years at risk (DYAR). The overall MT rate in the 1992 and 1993 birth cohorts was 154 dogs per 10,000 DYAR. The incidence for any MT claim increased with age and varied by breed, from 319 dogs per 10,000 DYAR in the English springer spaniel to 5 dogs per 10,000 DYAR in the rough-haired collie. At the ages 6, 8 and 10 years, 1%, 6% and 13% respectively, of all females had at least one MT claim. The MT mortality was 6 deaths per 10,000 DYAR and increased with age.

The disease onset, its clinical course, and survival period of the affected dogs were similar in both models. Skeletal dysplasia was noted radiographically at 2 months of age, whereas at 4 1/2 months of age there was progressive neurologic impairment. However, dwarfism and coarse facial features were seen only in ESS. Both models had similar deficiency in activity of lysosomal beta-galactosidase, but possessed a normal protein activator for GM1-beta-galactosidase. Both models stored GM1-ganglioside, asialo-GM1, and oligosaccharides in brain. Furthermore, only the PWD stored glycoproteins containing polylactosaminoglycans in visceral organs, and neither model stored them in the brain. Morphologically, both models demonstrated similar storage material in multiple tissues and cell types. The ultrastructure of the storage material was cell-type specific and identical in both models. However, some differences in the lectin staining pattern were noted. Our clinical, biochemical, and histochemical findings indicate that PWD and ESS may represent two different mutations of the beta-galactosidase gene. Moreover, the authors conclude that it is difficult, and inappropriate, to apply the human classification of GM1-gangliosidosis (i.e. infantile, juvenile, and adult forms) to these canine models.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oda, K</author><author>Lambert, E H</author><author>Lennon, V A</author><author>Palmer, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital canine myasthenia gravis: I.

Light microscopy revealed no difference in endplate size or nerve terminal morphology in age-matched CMG dogs and unaffected littermates. At all ages there was in individual muscle fibers of CMG dogs an approximately 75% lower postsynaptic membrane density of acetylcholine receptors (AChR). There was no evidence that this abnormality had an autoimmune basis. Measurements of miniature endplate potential amplitude in relation to fiber diameter revealed that the low density of AChR in the postsynaptic membrane of CMG dogs remained constant and did not change with the marked progression of muscle weakness during growth. Antigenic determinants of AChR were deficient in CMG muscle to the same extent as alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha BT) binding sites. Thus, a low density of AChR in the muscle's postsynaptic membrane appears to be the principal abnormality of CMG. The data suggest that the normal increase in number of acetylcholine (ACh) quanta released by nerve impulse may not fully compensate for the reduction in depolarization produced by a single quantum as the muscle fiber diameter increases. This could cause progression of weakness during growth. In addition to being a useful animal model of a rare form of CMG that resembles one form of human CMG, canine CMG offers a unique model for investigating events of synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giles, A R</author><author>Tinlin, S</author><author>Hoogendoorn, H</author><author>Greenwood, P</author><author>Greenwood, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of factor VIII:C antibodies in dogs with hemophilia A (factor VIII:C  deficiency).</title><secondary-title>Blood</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Blood</full-title></periodical><pages>451-456</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibody Specificity</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Autoantibodies</keyword><keyword>Bleeding Time</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Factor VIII</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hemarthrosis</keyword><keyword>Hemophilia A</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6419797</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Classic hemophilia A (factor VIII:C deficiency) was diagnosed in a miniature  Schnauzer dog and a breeding program established. Inbreeding and crossbreeding produced 16 hemophilic animals. All were initially treated with canine cryoprecipitate, as required, for sporadic hemorrhagic events. Five animals developed potent antibodies to canine factor VIII:C. All were the offspring of obligate carriers, resulting from the mating of a hemophilic purebred miniature Schnauzer male to a normal female Brittany spaniel. The mean age at first treatment and factor VIII exposure at the time of inhibitor development was 10.3 wk and 286.3 U, respectively. The remaining hemophilic animals have not developed antibodies, despite receiving a mean factor VIII dosage of 1.5 X 10(3) U. This group includes animals derived from a mating between the same purebred miniature Schnauzer hemophilic male and a purebred miniature Schnauzer carrier female. In each case, the antibodies recognize both canine and human but not porcine VIII:C. They are non-precipitating IgG immunoglobulins. Following inhibitor development, infusion of canine cryoprecipitate was hemostatically ineffective and factor VIII:C recovery at 30 min was negligible. Infusion of a concentrate of porcine factor VIII resulted in a correction of the hemostatic defect and optimal factor VIII:C recovery. All animals receiving porcine factor VIII:C subsequently developed antibodies to this protein. The chance occurrence of this complication should facilitate further studies directed at elucidating the pathogenesis and management of hemophilia complicated by the development of antibodies to factor VIII:C.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuenemann, Riccarda</author><author>Kamradt, Anne</author><author>Truar, Katrin</author><author>Oechtering, Gerhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and characterization of middle ear effusion in 55 brachycephalic dogs.</title><secondary-title>Tierarztliche Praxis.

Whereas the eye-catching deformities of the nose that lead to dramatic respiratory problems are obvious, changes of the middle ear are often an incidental finding on CT examinations and usually clinically inapparent. The objectives of this work were to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of middle ear effusion in brachycephalic dog breeds presented for multilevel surgery of upper airway obstructions. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Brachycephalic dogs with incidental middle ear effusion detected on CT scans obtained prior to surgical treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome were prospectively enrolled. A perendoscopic tympanocentesis followed by macroscopic description, microscopic cytology and bacteriological analysis of the fluid was performed. RESULTS:  Prevalence of middle ear effusion in all dogs presented to the department during the study period was 55/170 (32 %) in 86 middle ears. The only breeds suffering from MEE were French Bulldogs (FB) with a prevalence of 35/66 (53 %) and Pugs with a prevalence of 20/79 (25 %). Tympanocentesis was performed in 80 ears. In the majority of cases the effusion was either mucoid or serous, with a honey-like or ochre colour.Bacteriology was available for 76 ears and tested positive in 34 (45 %) cases. Cytology was performed in 73 ears and revealed all effusions to contain inflammatory cells with a high concentration in 23 (31.5 %) cases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  Brachycephalic dogs presented for surgical treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome have a high prevalence of incidental middle ear effusions. Cytological findings differ from previously reported analyses of effusions in Cavalier King Charles spaniels with clinical symptoms of primary secretory otitis media, where usually cell-free effusions are found. A study comparing effusions of brachycephalic dogs with vestibular disease to those found as an incidental condition is warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berger, Burkhard</author><author>Berger, Cordula</author><author>Heinrich, Josephin</author><author>Niederstätter, Harald</author><author>Hecht, Werner</author><author>Hellmann, Andreas</author><author>Rohleder, Udo</author><author>Schleenbecker, Uwe</author><author>Morf, Nadja</author><author>Freire-Aradas, Ana</author><author>McNevin, Dennis</author><author>Phillips, Christopher</author><author>Parson, Walther</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dog breed affiliation with a forensically validated canine STR set.</title><secondary-title>Forensic science international.

This STR panel had originally been selected for canine identification. The dog breeds sampled in this study featured a population frequency ≥1% and accounted for nearly 57% of the entire pedigree dog population in these three countries. Breed selection was based on a survey comprising records for nearly 1.9 million purebred dogs belonging to more than 500 different breeds. To derive breed membership from STR genotypes, a range of algorithms were used. These methods included discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), STRUCTURE, GeneClass2, and the adegenet package for R. STRUCTURE analyses suggested 21 distinct genetic clusters. Differentiation between most breeds was clearly discernable. Fourteen of 23 breeds (61%) exhibited maximum mean cluster membership proportions of more than 0.70 with a highest value of 0.90 found for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Dogs of only 6 breeds (26%) failed to consistently show only one major cluster. The DAPC method yielded the best assignment results in all 23 declared breeds with 97.5% assignment success. The frequency-based assignment test also provided a high success rate of 87%. These results indicate the potential viability of dog breed prediction using a well-established and sensitive set of 13 canine STR markers intended for forensic routine use.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, J L</author><author>DeFrancesco, T C</author><author>Tou, S P</author><author>Atkins, C E</author><author>Griffith, E H</author><author>Keene, B W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Outcome and survival in canine sick sinus syndrome and sinus node dysfunction: 93  cases (2002-2014).</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>199-212</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Sick Sinus Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Sinoatrial Node</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27286907</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2016.04.004</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and  outcomes of a group of dogs with sinoatrial node abnormalities. ANIMALS: Ninety-three client-owned dogs at a referral institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for clinical history, diagnostic testing, and medical or permanent artificial pacemaker (PAP) treatment. Owners or veterinarians were contacted for long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty-one dogs were symptomatic for their bradyarrhythmia and were diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome (SSS). Thirty-two dogs were asymptomatic for their bradyarrhythmia and were diagnosed with sinus node dysfunction (SND). Miniature Schnauzers, West Highland White terriers, Cocker spaniels, and female dogs were overrepresented. Medical management with positive chronotropic drugs successfully controlled syncope long-term in 54% of SSS dogs, and acted as a bridge to PAP in 20%. Positive atropine response predicted medical treatment success. Forty-six percent of SSS dogs eventually underwent PAP implantation. Median survival time was approximately 18 months in SND and SSS dogs regardless of treatment strategy. Congestive heart failure (CHF) associated with progressive valvular heart disease occurred commonly in all groups, particularly in dogs with bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus node dysfunction and SSS represent a spectrum of sinoatrial node disease, which for some dogs may also involve a component of autonomic dysfunction. Dogs with SND do not require treatment. Dogs with SSS often require treatment to reduce the frequency of syncope; medical management is often useful, particularly in atropine responsive dogs. Prognosis of SSS with treatment is good, though development of CHF does not appear to be mitigated by treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pessina, Paula</author><author>Fernández-Foren, Andrea</author><author>Cueto, Enrique</author><author>Delucchi, Luis</author><author>Castillo, Victor</author><author>Meikle, Ana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cortisol secretion after adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and dexamethasone tests in  healthy female and male dogs.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>33</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenocorticotropic Hormone</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol</keyword><keyword>Dexamethasone</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hydrocortisone</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Triglycerides</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19686591</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1751-0147-51-33</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: For the conclusive diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome, a stimulating  ACTH test or a low suppressive Dexamethasone test is used. Reports in other species than the dog indicate that plasma cortisol concentration after ACTH administration is affected by gender. We investigated the effect of gender on the cortisol response to ACTH and Dexamethasone tests in dogs. METHODS: Seven healthy adult Cocker Spaniels (4 females and 3 males) were assigned to a two by two factorial design: 4 dogs (2 females and 2 males) received IV Dexamethasone 0.01 mg/kg, while the other 3 dogs received an IV saline solution (control group). Two weeks later the treatments were reversed. After one month, ACTH was given IV (250 microg/animal) to 4 dogs (2 female and 2 males) while the rest was treated with saline solution (control group). Cortisol concentrations were determined by a direct solid-phase radioimmunoassay and cholesterol and triglycerides by commercial kits. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No effect of treatment was observed in metabolite concentrations, but females presented higher cholesterol concentrations. ACTH-treated dogs showed an increase in cortisol levels in the first hour after sampling until 3 hours post injection. Cortisol concentrations in Dexamethasone-treated dogs decreased one hour post injection and remained low for 3 hours, thereafter cortisol concentrations increased. The increase in cortisol levels from one to two hours post ACTH injection was significantly higher in females than males. In Dexamethasone-treated males cortisol levels decreased one hour post injection up to 3 hours; in females the decrease was more pronounced and prolonged, up to 5 hours post injection. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that cortisol response to ACTH and Dexamethasone treatment in dogs differs according to sex.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hansson, Kerstin</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Kvart, Clarence</author><author>Lord, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interobserver variability of vertebral heart size measurements in dogs with  normal and enlarged hearts.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>122-130</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomegaly</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Observer Variation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>Thoracic Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15869155</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2005.00024.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The vertebral heart size (VHS) method by Buchanan is based on anatomic landmarks.  A potential source of variation among observers is differences in the selection of measurement points. The objective was to test variability between observers with different levels of training in thoracic radiology and small animal clinical practice. Fifty sets of thoracic radiographs of cavalier King Charles spaniels, were divided into five groups; (Normal) normal cardiopulmonary structures, (I) slight cardiomegaly, (II) moderate cardiomegaly, (II +) moderate cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure, and (III +) severe cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure. Cardiomegaly was confirmed by echocardiography to be caused by mitral regurgitation because of myxomatous mitral valve disease. Sixteen observers representing four levels of experience (four observers/level) evaluated the radiographs; (1) European Diplomates in Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging, (2) Experienced small animal clinicians, (3) Trainees in small animal clinical practice (4) Veterinary students. Almost identical mean VHS values were found among the four experience levels for each of the five groups of radiographs with a low coefficient of variation, range 1.5-3.2%. Mean difference among the 16 observers was 1.05 +/- 0.32 vertebrae (v). Mean difference among individuals in each observer group was approximately 0.5 v for all but the groups of trainees were the difference was 0.6-0.9 v. The conclusion is that VHS method for heart size is independent of observer experience but dependent of individual observers selection of reference points and transformation of long and short axis dimensions into VHS units.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barker, C</author><author>Dell, A</author><author>Rogers, M</author><author>Alhadeff, J A</author><author>Winchester, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine alpha-L-fucosidase in relation to the enzymic defect and storage products  in canine fucosidosis.</title><secondary-title>The Biochemical journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Biochemical journal</full-title></periodical><pages>861-868</pages><volume>254</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blotting, Western</keyword><keyword>Chemical Precipitation</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, Gel</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, Thin Layer</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Fucosidosis</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Tissue Distribution</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>3196299</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1042/bj2540861</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine liver alpha-L-fucosidase was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity  chromatography on agarose-epsilon-aminohexanoyl-fucopyranosylamine. It is composed of multiple forms of a common active subunit of 45-50 kDa, which can aggregate in different combinations to form polymers, predominantly dimers. Antiserum was raised against the purified enzyme. There is negligible residual alpha-L-fucosidase in the tissues of English springer spaniels with the lysosomal storage disease fucosidosis. Although no alpha-L-fucosidase protein was detected by Western blotting or by the purification procedure in the affected tissues, some enzymically inactive cross-reacting material was detected in both normal and affected tissues. This suggests that another protein without alpha-L-fucosidase activity was co-purified with the enzyme. Dog liver alpha-L-fucosidase was precipitated by goat anti-(human liver alpha-L-fucosidase) IgG, indicating homology between the enzymes in the two species. Two purified storage products isolated from the brain of a dog with fucosidosis were used as natural substrates for various preparations of canine liver alpha-L-fucosidase. Analysis of the digestion mixtures by t.l.c. and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry suggests that canine alpha-L-fucosidase acts preferentially on the alpha-(1-3)-linked fucose at the non-reducing end and that removal of alpha-(1-6)-linked asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine is rate-limiting in the lysosomal catabolism of fucosylated N-linked glycans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eigenmann, J E</author><author>Patterson, D F</author><author>Zapf, J</author><author>Froesch, E R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insulin-like growth factor I in the dog: a study in different dog breeds and in  dogs with growth hormone elevation.</title><secondary-title>Acta endocrinologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta endocrinologica</full-title></periodical><pages>294-301</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Acromegaly</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, Gel</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Growth Hormone</keyword><keyword>Insulin</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Radioimmunoassay</keyword><keyword>Somatomedins</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6367329</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1530/acta.0.1050294</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A radioimmunoassay (RIA) devised for the measurement of human insulin-like growth  factor I (IGF I) was employed for the measurement of canine IGF I. Canine IGF I was extracted from plasma specimens by gel chromatography. Columns were eluted with 1 M acetic acid and the fractions representing the 55 to 85% bed volume were pooled, lyophilized and reconstituted with assay buffer. Serial dilutions of canine IGF I from both normal and acromegalic dogs when added to the RIA system gave a similar displacement pattern of human [125I]IGF I as the one obtained by the addition of unlabelled human IGF I. The dose-response curve obtained by canine IGF I paralleled the one obtained by human IGF I. Logit-log transformation and least squares fitting resulted in straight line fitting of the standard curve between 0.039 and 5 ng IGF I added per tube. The within-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 16.7% and the between-assay CV was 21.8%. Plasma IGF I concentrations in normal dogs appeared to be a function of body size. The concentrations were 36 +/- 27 ng/ml in Cocker Spaniels, 87 +/- 33 ng/ml in Beagles, 117 +/- 34 ng/ml in Keeshonds, and 280 +/- 23 ng/ml in German Shepherds (mean +/- SEM). The mean IGF I level in a group of dogs with growth hormone (GH) elevation was 700 +/- 90 ng/ml. Though this group of dogs comprised both small and large dogs, the mean IGF I level significantly differed from the one found in German Shepherds, the largest breed studied (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rawicka, Aleksandra</author><author>Crasta, Manuela</author><author>Guandalini, Adolfo</author><author>Peruccio, Claudio</author><author>Multari, Domenico</author><author>Rondena, Marco</author><author>D'Anna, Nunzio</author><author>Giudice, Chiara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conjunctival Extramedullary Plasmacytoma in Dogs and a Cat: Clinical  Characteristics and Histopathological Findings.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36359139</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani12213015</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a plasma cell tumor that is very  rarely reported in ocular and adnexal tissue and is usually solitary and benign. METHODS: This study evaluated seven cases from different ophthalmology referrals submitted for histopathological analysis between 2013 and 2022. RESULTS: EMPs were diagnosed in a 9-year-old domestic short-haired cat and in six dogs (median age, 10 years): three English Cocker Spaniels, a Golden Retriever, a Maltese, and a Pinscher. EMPs affected the third eyelid conjunctiva in five cases (5/7), followed by the superior bulbar (1/7) and palpebral conjunctivae (1/7), respectively, and were presented mostly as well-defined, salmon-colored nodules. Histopathologically, the masses were composed of sheets and packets of round cells morphologically consistent with mature plasma cells with mild anisocytosis and anisokaryosis; mitosis and binucleated giant cells were rarely observed. Follow up for 6/7 cases ranged from 6 months to 2 years. No signs of recurrence or systemic involvement (multiple myeloma) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: EMP should be included in the differential diagnoses of canine and feline conjunctival masses. Staging recommendations should include multiple myeloma diagnostic evaluation. Our results suggest that primary conjunctival EMP does not appear to be locally aggressive and has low systemic involvement behavior. The local surgical excision alone or combined with cryotherapy should be curative.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freitas, Ines</author><author>Taeymans, Olivier</author><author>Knott, Tim</author><author>Civello, Alexander</author><author>Wegg, Michaela</author><author>Gomez, Alberto</author><author>Oliver, James Andrew Clive</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine idiopathic orbital inflammation: A case series of four affected dogs (five  orbits).</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>454-467</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Orbit</keyword><keyword>Orbital Pseudotumor</keyword><keyword>Remission, Spontaneous</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35695836</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.13003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: In humans, idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) is a diagnosis  attributed to benign, inflammatory orbital conditions without identifiable local or systemic cause. We describe the clinical signs, imaging and histopathological findings, management and outcome of four dogs diagnosed with IOI. METHODS: Multicentric retrospective study. RESULTS: A total of four dogs (five orbits) of three different breeds (three cases were English Springer Spaniels [ESS] or ESS-cross) and ages ranging from 3 to 12 years were included. Initial presenting signs were unilateral and included exophthalmos, enophthalmos, globe deviation, thickening and protrusion of the third eyelid and conjunctival hyperemia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identified heterogeneous space-occupying, contrast-enhancing orbital lesions in all cases. Sparing of the retrobulbar space was detected in four of five orbits. Histopathology revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. Immunohistochemistry was performed in two cases highlighting the presence of histiocytes and lymphocytes, predominantly T cells. Resolution of clinical signs was achieved in two cases managed with oral immunosuppressant medication (corticosteroids alone or combined with cyclosporine or azathioprine), one went into spontaneous remission, one resolved with topical corticosteroids, and one underwent exenteration. Recurrence occurred in two cases within 15 months of initial diagnosis and required further immunosuppressant medication. One case developed signs in the contralateral orbit within 8 months of presentation. CONCLUSIONS: IOI is an uncommon condition in dogs. Its diagnosis relies on the combination of advanced imaging and histology. As in humans, it appears that spontaneous remission and recurrence may occur requiring long-term immunosuppressant medication.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freitas, Henrique M</author><author>Somma, André T</author><author>Moore, Bret A</author><author>Montiani-Ferreira, Fabiano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrospective and prospective study of progressive retinal atrophy in dogs  presented to the veterinary hospital of the Federal University of Parana, Brazil.</title><secondary-title>Open veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>370-378</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Animal</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34722198</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5455/OVJ.2021.v11.i3.6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is one of the main causes of  blindness in dogs. Despite its clinical importance, there is limited epidemiological information available, particularly in South America. AIM: The main objective of this study was to perform a retrospective, and prospective analysis of PRA in dogs admitted at the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Paraná, Brazil. METHODS: Medical records of dogs admitted between 2014 and 2018 were selected through the archives of the Comparative Ophthalmology Laboratory. A total of 130 dogs with medical records indicating clinical signs suggestive of PRA, independent of the electroretinography confirmation, were selected. In order to investigate common characteristics, each patient's clinical history, ophthalmic examination, and visual status were reviewed (obstacle course, pupillary light reflex, dazzle reflex, visual tracking to a cotton ball, and menace responses). Additionally, a prospective study was performed, where flash electroretinography was performed on 30 animals with clinical signs suggestive of PRA, and 14 animals were selected for fundus photography. Data were assessed through descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: A total of 2,055 dogs were evaluated between January 2014 and December 2018. Of those, 130 animals were presumptively diagnosed with PRA (6.33%), consisting of 18 different breeds and 27 dogs with a mixed pedigree. Poodles were the most prevalent breed (n = 26; 20.00%), followed by Cocker Spaniels (n = 19; 14.62%). In the reported caseload, Pomeranians showed a considerably higher odds ratio for PRA development (15.36%). CONCLUSION: Pomeranians presented a high odds ratio, suggesting that further studies may be performed with breeds with a high potential for developing this disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hardwick, Laura J A</author><author>Kortum, Andre J</author><author>Constantino-Casas, Fernando</author><author>Watson, Penny J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed-related expression patterns of Ki67, γH2AX, and p21 during ageing in the  canine liver.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary research communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary research communications</full-title></periodical><pages>21-30</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cellular Senescence</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Histones</keyword><keyword>Ki-67 Antigen</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33301127</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11259-020-09784-x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cellular senescence is a molecular hallmark of ageing that is associated with  multiple pathologies, and DNA damage marker γH2AX, together with cell cycle inhibitor p21, have been used as senescence markers in multiple species including dogs. Idiopathic canine chronic hepatitis has recognised breed-related differences in predisposition and prognosis, but reasons behind this are poorly understood. This retrospective study using archived post mortem tissue aimed to provide insight into liver ageing in 51 microscopically normal canine livers across seven breed categories, including those with and without increased risk of chronic hepatitis. Immunohistochemistry was conducted for γH2AX, p21, and cell proliferation marker Ki67, and the mean number of positive hepatocytes per high power field was determined. All three markers were strongly correlated to each other, but no age-dependent expression was seen in the combined study population. Overall expression levels were low in most dogs, with median values representing less than 1.5% of hepatocytes, but this increased to 20-30% in individual dogs at the upper end of the range. Individual breed differences were noted in two breeds that have increased risk of chronic hepatitis, with English Springer Spaniels having lower expression of Ki67 than other dogs, and Labradors having higher expression of Ki67 and γH2AX than other dogs. These results warrant further investigation in these breeds and highlight a need to validate reliable markers of cellular senescence in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carbonell Buj, Elena</author><author>Burton, Neil</author><author>Mosley, John R</author><author>Meeson, Richard L</author><author>Major, Alison</author><author>Whitelock, Richard G</author><author>Parsons, Kevin</author><author>Langley-Hobbs, Sorrel J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isolated Articular Fractures of the Canine Talus: Diagnosis and Signalment in  Fourteen Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>68-73</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fractures, Bone</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Talus</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33058090</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/s-0040-1716419</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this retrospective multicentre case series was to describe  signalment, presenting signs and imaging findings in dogs with isolated articular fractures of the talus. STUDY DESIGN:  Medical records (2008-2019) of dogs with isolated articular talar fractures were reviewed. RESULTS:  Fourteen dogs met the inclusion criteria; affected breeds were four German Pointer (three shorthair and one wirehaired), three Labrador Retrievers, two Rottweilers, two Springer Spaniels, one cross breed, one Greyhound and one Great Münsterländer. The age range was 1 to 8 years with a median of 4.7 years. Lameness was usually acute in onset and had been present for a range of 4 to 540 days prior to referral.The most common fracture configuration involved the lateral trochlear ridge only (n = 9). Two of the fourteen fractures affected both trochlear ridges. Thirteen dogs were initially assessed radiographically with classic orthogonal views, but a fracture was only visible in five cases. The remainder were confirmed with further radiographic projections (n = 4) or computed tomography (n = 5). In one case, the lameness was located to the tarsus by scintigraphy. CONCLUSION: Isolated articular fracture of the talus is rare and may prove a diagnostic challenge due to the varied presentations and complex anatomy of the bone. Pathology of the talus may be suspected in any case of lameness localized to the tarsus and oblique/skyline radiographic views or advanced imaging should be performed if standard radiographic views are unremarkable.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, M K</author><author>Toribio, J-Alml</author><author>Podadera, J M</author><author>Child, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence, cause, outcome and possible risk factors associated with facial nerve  paralysis in dogs in a Sydney population (2001-2016): a retrospective study.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>140-147</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Facial Nerve</keyword><keyword>Facial Paralysis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31867719</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.12906</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the incidence and causes of facial nerve  paralysis (FNP) in dogs in the Sydney region. Its outcome and possible risk factors are investigated to prognosticate and aid design of diagnostic and treatment plans. DESIGN: Retrospective case study. METHODS: Client-owned dogs presented to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Sydney (UVTHS), between 2001 and 2016 with FNP were included (n = 122). The incidence of each cause of FNP was investigated. A reference population of noncases seen at the UVTHS during the same time period was used to study the association between idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (IFNP) and gender, age and breed. RESULTS: IFNP (29.5%) was the most common diagnosis. Male dogs (odds ratio [OR], 2.3) had increased odds of IFNP compared with female dogs. Age was a significant risk factor for both the occurrence of FNP and IFNP. There was higher occurrence of IFNP among middle-aged dogs (5-13 years) and reduced risk in juvenile dogs (less than 2 years). Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were over-represented for FNP (OR, 6.9) and IFNP (OR, 17.5). For IFNP, 6 of 16 dogs with known follow-up showed definitive resolution within 3 years of diagnosis. Concurrent vestibular signs were common in dogs with middle/inner ear abnormality and intracranial disease; and were also seen in 50% of dogs with IFNP. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate statistical predilections in age, gender and breed for IFNP. Guarded prognosis for recovery should be given to dogs diagnosed with IFNP and supportive management instigated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aoki, Takuma</author><author>Miyamoto, Takashi</author><author>Fukamachi, Naoyuki</author><author>Niimi, Seiya</author><author>Jingya, Yao</author><author>Wakao, Yoshito</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combination of the Modified Loop Technique and De Vega Annuloplasty in Dogs with  Mitral Regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35804552</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani12131653</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Background: Detailed surgical techniques for treating canine mitral regurgitation  have not been previously reported.

Mitral annuloplasty was subjectively performed, targeting the circumference of the septal leaflet. Results: The breeds were Chihuahua-mixed breed, Spitz, Pomeranian, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and Chihuahua, with average ages and weights of 11.4 ± 2.3 years and 5.49 ± 2.98 kg, respectively. The aortic cross-clamp, pumping, and surgery times were 64.0 ± 7.5 min, 168.5 ± 39.1 min, and 321.0 ± 53.1 min, respectively. After MODEL surgery, left atrial-to-aortic ratios significantly decreased from 2.20 ± 0.18 to 1.26 ± 0.22 (p &lt; 0.01), and left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter normalized to body weight significantly decreased from 2.03 ± 0.26 to 1.48 ± 0.20 (p &lt; 0.01). In all cases, the clinical signs disappeared or improved significantly. Conclusions: MODEL surgery increased mitral valve coaptation, normalized heart sizes, and significantly improved clinical signs in dogs with mitral regurgitation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tomo, Yuma</author><author>Sobashima, Erina</author><author>Eto, Hinano</author><author>Yamazaki, Atsushi</author><author>Tanegashima, Koji</author><author>Edamura, Kazuya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection following  tibial plateau leveling osteotomy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Open veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>728-733</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</keyword><keyword>Osteotomy</keyword><keyword>Rifampin</keyword><keyword>Stifle</keyword><keyword>Vancomycin</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>35070870</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5455/OVJ.2021.v11.i4.25</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In recent years, surgical site infections caused by drug-resistant  pathogens have emerged as a cause of concern in small animal practice. In this report, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections associated with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) is reported. However, there have been no reports on the treatment of MRSA infection following TPLO in dogs. This case report describes the use of a combination of vancomycin and rifampicin to treat MRSA infection following TPLO in a dog. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old spayed female American cocker spaniel was referred for right hind limb lameness that did not improve with conservative treatment. The dog was diagnosed with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, for which TPLO was performed. Once the surgical wound was closed, the dog licked the skin on the surgical site, causing the injury to dehisce. MRSA was detected from the purulent discharge, and chloramphenicol was then administered based on the drug sensitivity test results. Because of the continued drainage, the implants were removed after the bone union of the osteotomy site was observed. Since this did not provide any relief to the existing condition, the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin at 132 days after TPLO surgery, and the infected location was cleaned many times through a drain tube placed into the tibia. However, the infection could not be controlled. Thus, a rifampicin and vancomycin combination was started. As a result, the purulent discharge disappeared and the fistula entirely closed on the 154th day after TPLO surgery. CONCLUSION: A combination of rifampicin and vancomycin may be effective for treating MRSA infection at the surgical site following TPLO surgery that does not heal despite implant removal and administration of vancomycin.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mischke, Reinhard</author><author>Metzger, Julia</author><author>Distl, Ottmar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An FGA Frameshift Variant Associated with Afibrinogenemia in Dachshunds.</title><secondary-title>Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Afibrinogenemia</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fibrinogen</keyword><keyword>Frameshift Mutation</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34356081</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/genes12071065</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Congenital fibrinogen disorders are very rare in dogs. Cases of afibrinogenemia  have been reported in Bernese Mountain, Bichon Frise, Cocker Spaniel, Collie, Lhasa Apso, Viszla, and St. Bernard dogs. In the present study, we examined four miniature wire-haired Dachshunds with afibrinogenemia and ascertained their pedigree. Homozygosity mapping and a genome-wide association study identified a candidate genomic region at 50,188,932-64,187,680 bp on CFA15 harboring FGB (fibrinogen beta chain), FGA (fibrinogen alpha chain), and FGG (fibrinogen gamma-B chain). Sanger sequencing of all three fibrinogen genes in two cases and validation of the FGA-associated mutation (FGA:g.6296delT, NC_006597.3:g.52240694delA, rs1152388481) in pedigree members showed a perfect co-segregation with afibrinogenemia-affected phenotypes, obligate carriers, and healthy animals. In addition, the rs1152388481 variant was validated in 393 Dachshunds and samples from 33 other dog breeds. The rs1152388481 variant is predicted to modify the protein sequence of both FGA transcripts (FGA201:p.Ile486Met and FGA-202:p.Ile555Met) leading to proteins truncated by 306 amino acids. The present data provide evidence for a novel FGA truncating frameshift mutation that is very likely to explain the cases of severe bleeding due to afibrinogenemia in a Dachshund family. This mutation has already been spread in Dachshunds through carriers before cases were ascertained. Genetic testing allows selective breeding to prevent afibrinogenemia-affected puppies in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allerton, F</author><author>Swinbourne, F</author><author>Barker, L</author><author>Black, V</author><author>Kathrani, A</author><author>Tivers, M</author><author>Henriques, T</author><author>Kisielewicz, C</author><author>Dunning, M</author><author>Kent, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gall bladder mucoceles in Border terriers.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1618-1628</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gallbladder Diseases</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Mucocele</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30079451</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15249</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Gall bladder mucoceles (GBM) are a leading cause of biliary disease  in dogs with several breeds, including the Shetland Sheepdog, American Cocker Spaniel, Chihuahua, Pomeranian, and Miniature Schnauzer apparently predisposed. OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors, clinical features, and response to treatment of GBM in Border terriers (BT). ANIMALS: Medical records of 99 dogs (including 51 BT) with an ultrasonographic (±histopathologic) diagnosis of GBM from three referral centers in the United Kingdom were collected. A control group of 87 similar-aged BT with no ultrasonographic evidence of gall bladder disease was selected for comparison. METHOD: Retrospective case-control study. Odds ratios were calculated to establish breed predisposition. Signalment, presence of endocrine disease, clinicopathologic results, and outcome were compared between the BT, other breeds, and control BTs. RESULTS: The odds of identifying a GBM in a BT in this hospital population was 85 times that of all other breeds (95% confidence interval 56.9-126.8). BT had similar clinical signs and clinicopathologic changes to other breeds with GBM. There was no evidence that endocrinopathies were associated with GBM in BT. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A robust breed predisposition to GBM is established for the BT.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weissenbacher-Lang, Christiane</author><author>Fuchs-Baumgartinger, Andrea</author><author>Guija-De-Arespacochaga, Abigail</author><author>Klang, Andrea</author><author>Weissenböck, Herbert</author><author>Künzel, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pneumocystosis in dogs: meta-analysis of 43 published cases including clinical  signs, diagnostic procedures, and treatment.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</full-title></periodical><pages>26-35</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>Pneumocystis Infections</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29145787</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1040638717742429</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We evaluated 43 published cases of dogs with confirmed Pneumocystis infection  regarding the value of clinical parameters indicating the presence of the disease as well as tools for the detection of the pathogen. The assessed parameters included clinical signs, laboratory findings, results of thoracic radiography, autopsy, histopathology, methods for the detection of Pneumocystis, as well as medical therapy. Pneumocystosis was diagnosed most often in certain breeds (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Miniature Dachshund) with a predisposition for impaired immunity. The median age of the dogs was 1 y. Chronic therapy-resistant respiratory signs, such as tachypnea, dyspnea, and cough, along with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and hypogammaglobulinemia, were the most frequently described clinical and clinicopathologic abnormalities. Pneumocystosis can be masked by coinfections with other respiratory pathogens, and the successful detection of Pneumocystis organisms is of major relevance. Several detection methods have been used in the past, but only a few provide reliable results. In 2017, the cytologic evaluation of Giemsa-stained bronchoalveolar lavage samples is generally used, even if sensitivity is only moderate. More reliable results can be achieved using special stains or sensitive molecular techniques. Fast and reliable detection of Pneumocystis is the essential basis for appropriate treatment and higher survival chances for dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alder, Daniela S</author><author>Oevermann, Anna</author><author>Pfister, Stephan A</author><author>Steffen, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spinal neurenteric cyst in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>775-778</pages><volume>250</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Neural Tube Defects</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Compression</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28306488</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.250.7.775</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION An 11-year-old English Cocker Spaniel was evaluated because of  chronic progressive ataxia of the hind limbs. CLINICAL FINDINGS The dog had no history of previous illness, and findings of physical examination and laboratory tests were unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed that the dog was ambulatory with severe ataxia of the hind limbs. Proprioception was decreased in the right and left hind limbs (right affected more than left), and spinal reflexes were bilaterally unremarkable. Moderate signs of pain were detected during palpation of the lumbar portion of the vertebral column. Findings suggested a lesion within the thoracolumbar or lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extradural spinal cord compression attributable to an extradural space-occupying lesion originating from or infiltrating the L4 lamina on the right side. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Hemilaminectomy was performed to remove the extradural lesion. Histologic findings for tissue samples collected during the procedure were consistent with a neurenteric cyst. The late onset and progression of clinical signs of this rare congenital malformation were suspected to have been the result of enlargement of the neurenteric cyst through continuous production of mucus by goblet cells. The dog responded favorably to surgical decompression and was clinically normal 1 year after surgery. It was euthanized 2 years after surgery for an unrelated reason (end-stage heart disease), and no neurologic deficits were evident before that point. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Congenital neurenteric cysts should be considered as a differential diagnosis for neoplastic disease in dogs in which results of diagnostic imaging indicate the presence of an extradural mass affecting vertebral structures.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blundell, R</author><author>Adam, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Haemolytic anaemia and acute pancreatitis associated with zinc toxicosis in a  dog.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>17</pages><volume>172</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing</keyword><keyword>Zinc</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>toxicity</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23180148</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.100376</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We describe a case of zinc toxicity in a 14-month-old, female, neutered, Cavalier  King Charles spaniel with a 48-hour history of haematochezia, icterus and collapse. Regenerative anaemia with a packed-cell volume of 7 per cent was seen. Prior to referral, radiography had revealed a gastric, metallic foreign body which was removed at exploratory laparotomy. On presentation, the dog was comatose, hypothermic and bradycardic - resuscitation was performed successfully, but the dog then displayed marked abdominal pain. The dog died 12 hours after presentation. At postmortem examination, the animal showed severe icterus. Both kidneys were diffusely dark red; the pancreas was diffusely pale and nodular. Histopathological examination revealed evidence of intravascular haemolysis with blood vessel lumens containing haemoglobin. The renal tubules also contained large amounts of intraluminal haemoglobin with haemoglobin crystals scattered throughout the cortex and medulla. The pancreas exhibited multifocal coagulative necrosis, surrounded by a neutrophil-dominated inflammatory infiltrate. Zinc levels were markedly increased above the normal reference range in both liver and kidney. This report describes the clinical and pathological findings of a case of acute zinc toxicity in a dog following ingestion of a metallic object which resulted in marked haemolytic anaemia and acute pancreatitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fitzwater, Kathryn L</author><author>Marks, Steven L</author><author>Hanel, Rita M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thrombi in the trachea of a dog secondary to placement of a tracheotomy tube.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>758-760</pages><volume>233</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Airway Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchial Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Thrombectomy</keyword><keyword>Thrombosis</keyword><keyword>Tracheal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Tracheotomy</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18764713</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.233.5.758</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old Spaniel-crossbreed dog was evaluated for  stertorous breathing and inspiratory stridor. CLINICAL FINDINGS: A temporary tracheotomy tube was placed prior to referral. Results of physical examination at our facility, including thoracic auscultation, were unremarkable. Examination of the larynx revealed a 2 x 2-cm nodular mass on the lateral aspect of the epiglottis and left arytenoid cartilage. Cytologic examination of the mass indicated septic suppurative inflammation and intracellular rod-shaped bacteria. During the procedures, decreased air movement through the temporary tracheotomy tube was detected, and the tube was replaced. A thrombus was found on the distal end of the temporary tracheotomy tube; the thrombus obstructed 90% of the tube lumen. Approximately 12 hours later, auscultation revealed decreased sounds in all lung fields. Cervical and thoracic radiography revealed an intraluminal soft tissue opacity distal to the tracheotomy tube. A thrombus that contained hair and plant material was removed from the trachea by use of an embolectomy catheter and videogastroscope. Approximately 30 hours after removal of the initial thrombus, the dog had an episode of respiratory distress. Cervical radiography revealed another intraluminal opacity. It was another thrombus, which also was removed by use of the videogastroscope. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Tracheoscopy was performed with a videogastroscope in an attempt to remove the thrombi. A Fogarty catheter was used to remove the initial intraluminal thrombus from the trachea. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Airway obstruction resulting from an intraluminal thrombus in the trachea should be considered as a secondary complication after tracheotomy tube placement.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breaux, Carrie B</author><author>Sandmeyer, Lynne S</author><author>Grahn, Bruce H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunohistochemical investigation of canine episcleritis.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>168-172</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Alberta</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>B-Lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Scleritis</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17445078</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00528.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To identify macrophages, B cells and T cells in archived canine  episcleral biopsies and to correlate these findings with the clinical presentation and therapeutic outcome. PROCEDURES: Archived formalin-fixed biopsies were immunohistochemically labeled for CD18, CD79a, and CD3 to identify macrophages, B cells and T cells, respectively. Slides were digitally photographed and positive cells were manually counted. Signalment, duration of illness, affected eye(s), treatment, and therapeutic outcome were reviewed for each dog. Dogs were divided into groups based on clinical presentation (unilateral episcleritis, bilateral episcleritis or nodular granulomatous episclerokeratitis (NGE). RESULTS: Twenty-four cases were evaluated. There were 19 episcleritis (13 unilateral, six bilateral) and five NGE cases. The mean age for clinical manifestations of unilateral episcleritis was 6.8 years, bilateral episcleritis was 8.7 years, and NGE was 3.8 years. The Cocker Spaniel was over-represented in the episcleritis groups. All NGE cases were Collies. Approximately 50% of the unilateral episcleritis cases resolved and did not require long-term therapy. Almost all cases of bilateral episcleritis and NGE required continuous medical therapy to maintain remission. There was a significantly higher percentage of B lymphocytes in biopsies from lesions that required ongoing medical therapy to maintain lesion remission than in the lesions that resolved, and for which medications were discontinued (P = 0.0471). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for resolution of NGE and bilateral episcleritis without long-term medical therapy is poor. There is a significant difference in the inflammatory cell population in episcleritis that resolved with medical therapy vs. episcleritis that required ongoing medical therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Douglass, James P</author><author>Berry, Clifford R</author><author>Thrall, Donald E</author><author>Malarkey, David E</author><author>Spaulding, Kathy A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Radiographic features of aortic bulb/valve mineralization in 20 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>20-27</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aortic Valve</keyword><keyword>Calcification, Physiologic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12620045</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2003.tb01443.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The radiographic features of aortic bulb/valve mineralization in 20 dogs were  reviewed. Extent, shape, number, and location of mineralization were recorded. Five of the dogs had additional alternate imaging examinations, including bone scintigraphy, echocardiography, and thoracic computed tomography. A necropsy was done on one dog, and the area of mineralization was evaluated using routine histology. The median age was 10 (mean 9.7; SD +/- 2.7) years. There were five males, seven neutered males, one female, and seven neutered females. The breeds were: Irish setter (6); rottweiler (7); chow-chow (1); miniature dachshund (1); borzoi (1); English setter (1); English springer spaniel (1); great Dane (1); and greyhound (1). Dogs with both right and left lateral radiographs (n = 17) had mineralization visible on both views, more conspicuously on the right lateral radiograph (n = 12). Aortic bulb mineralization was identified on the ventrodorsal radiograph of only one dog. On lateral radiographs, the aortic bulb mineralization was localized within the 4th intercostal space and in the craniodorsal quadrant of the cardiac silhouette. In nine of the dogs, there were complex or multiple mineralizations and in 11 dogs, there was a single curvilinear mineral opacity oriented in a caudoventral to craniodorsal direction. In all radiographs, the mineralization was in the expected position of the aortic bulb, and echocardiography (n = 4), spiral computed tomography (n = 2), and necropsy (n = 1) confirmed that the mineralization was within the aortic bulb. Clinical pathologic data of the dogs suggested no reason for metastatic mineralization. Exact etiopathogenesis of the lesions were not determined in this study. Based on the histologic findings in one dog, the mineralization seen in the aortic root is similar to a form of dystrophic mineralization called Monckeberg's calcific arteriosclerosis in humans. No clinical signs attributable to the mineralization were observed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danpure, C J</author><author>Jennings, P R</author><author>Jansen, J H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enzymological characterization of a putative canine analogue of primary  hyperoxaluria type 1.</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</full-title></periodical><pages>134-138</pages><volume>1096</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Alanine Transaminase</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aspartate Aminotransferases</keyword><keyword>Blotting, Western</keyword><keyword>D-Amino-Acid Oxidase</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hyperoxaluria</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>L-Lactate Dehydrogenase</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Transaminases</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year></dates><accession-num>1672096</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0925-4439(91)90051-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This paper concerns an enzymological investigation into a putative canine  analogue of the human autosomal recessive disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (alanine:glyoxylate/serine:pyruvate aminotransferase deficiency). The liver and kidney activities of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase and serine:pyruvate aminotransferase in two Tibetan Spaniel pups with familial oxalate nephropathy were markedly reduced when compared with a variety of controls. There were no obvious deficiencies in a number of other enzymes including D-glycerate dehydrogenase/glyoxylate reductase which have been shown previously to be deficient in primary hyperoxaluria type 2. Immunoblotting of liver and kidney homogenates from oxalotic dogs also demonstrated a severe deficiency of immunoreactive alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase. The developmental expression of alanine:glyoxylate/serine:pyruvate aminotransferase was studied in the livers and kidneys of control dogs. In the liver, enzyme activity and immunoreactive protein were virtually undetectable at 1 day old, but then increased to reach a plateau between 4 and 12 weeks. During this period the activity was similar to that found in normal human liver. The enzyme activities and the levels of immunoreactive protein in the kidneys were more erratic, but they appeared to increase up to 8 weeks and then decrease, so that by 36 weeks the levels were similar to those found at 1 day. The data presented in this paper suggest that these oxalotic dogs have a genetic condition that is analogous, at least enzymologically, to the human disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Inuzuka, T</author><author>Duncan, I D</author><author>Quarles, R H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myelin proteins in the CNS of 'shaking pups'.</title><secondary-title>Brain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain research</full-title></periodical><pages>43-50</pages><volume>392</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Myelin Proteins</keyword><keyword>Myelin Sheath</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Telencephalon</keyword><keyword>Tremor</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3708384</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myelin proteins were quantitated in whole tissue and isolated 'myelin fractions'  from spinal cord, brainstem and hemispheres of 'shaking pups', a mutation in Springer-Spaniel dogs characterized by hypomyelination of the CNS. The amount of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the brainstem of affected 4-week-old pups was 2.6% of that in age-matched controls, while the levels of 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) were 10% and 15% of the control levels, respectively. Similar results were obtained in the spinal cord and hemispheres, and the amounts of these proteins in the mutant pups did not change substantially between 4 and 16 weeks of age. The amount of the 21 kDa MBP compared to the 18 kDa MBP was relatively increased in the shaking pups, suggesting that the small amount of myelin formed was immature. The yields of myelin fractions from the mutant pups were very low; e.g., the yield from the brainstems of 4-week-old mutants was only 2.4% of that from age-matched controls and the yield did not increase by 16 weeks. The isolated myelin fractions contained very little MBP (less than 0.5% of total protein) or proteolipid protein, indicating that they were a very immature form of myelin or consisted largely of non-myelin contaminants. MAG in the 'myelin fractions' from the mutant brainstems were 9-15 fold higher and CNP levels were 2-3 fold higher than those in whole homogenates, suggesting that the isolated fractions were enriched in oligodendroglia-derived membranes. Overall, the biochemical results are consistent with a severe hypomyelination of the CNS in which a small amount of immature myelin is formed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Souza, Clarissa Pimentel</author><author>Foss, Kari Denise</author><author>Mascarenhas, Mariana Bezerra</author><author>Clegg, Jennifer Loraine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Otitis media with effusion in two Boston terrier dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine and science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine and science</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36723508</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vms3.1092</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Otitis media (OM) in dogs can occur as a primary condition instead of as an  extension of an otitis externa (OE), characterized by the presence of fluid in the middle ear (ME) referred to as OM with effusion (OME). OME has been reported in a brachycephalic breed (boxer), and the same condition is described as primary secretory OM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. These dogs can be asymptomatic or present with pain, facial nerve paralysis and reduced hearing. This report describes two cases of OME with associated neurologic signs in Boston terriers with no previous history of OE, normal external ear canals and tympanic membranes. Neurologic evaluation revealed right head tilt along with vestibular ataxia and frequent walking tight circles to the right in case 1, and a dull mentation with a right-sided head tilt and torticollis, vestibular tetra-ataxia, ambulatory tetraparesis and circling to the right in case 2. MRI imaging of the brain was performed. Results showed bilateral OM with right-sided otitis interna and equivocal associated otogenic meningitis in case 1 and right-sided OM in case 2. Myringotomy was performed, and both dogs' ME sampled for cytology that only revealed inflammatory cells; and bacterial cultures which revealed a light growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in case 1. ME were flushed with sterile saline. Oral glucocorticoids and antibiotics based on the susceptibility results, and a compound antibiotic and glucocorticoid ear solution were prescribed to case 1. Neurologic improvement was observed a few days after the appointment, but a mild right-sided head tilt remained evident. Owner of case two elected humane euthanasia due to patient respiratory difficulties upon anaesthetic recovery and other concurrent healthy concerns. Current findings reinforce that brachycephalic dogs may be prone to develop OME, and advanced imaging tests are key to the diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, Collette</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Catchpole, Brian</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence and demographic risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs in the UK.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>e512</pages><volume>190</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Leptospirosis</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34057217</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vetr.512</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the annual incidence risk of leptospirosis diagnosis in  practice-attending dogs in the UK during 2016 and identify risk factors for diagnosis. METHODS: Incidence of leptospirosis diagnosis in dogs during 2016 was estimated from dogs in primary-care practices from the VetCompass Programme (n = 905,543). A case-control study of laboratory cases (n = 362) versus VetCompass controls explored factors (age, sex, neutering, breed, Kennel Club group, urban-rural location, indices of deprivation) associated with leptospirosis diagnosis through multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Annual incidence risk of leptospirosis in the VetCompass population was 0.8 cases per 100,000 dogs (0.0008%, 95% CI 9.1 × 10(-8) -5.2 × 10(-5) ). Adult dogs, especially 1- &lt; 5 years olds (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.54), and dogs attending urban clinics (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.35) had reduced odds of leptospirosis versus dogs &lt; 1 year old and rural dogs, respectively. Dogs attending clinics in less deprived areas had increased odds of diagnosis (OR = 3.63, 95% CI 2.28-5.78) compared to crossbreds, Cocker Spaniels (OR = 4.25, 95% CI 2.65-6.84), Collies (OR = 3.53, 95% CI 2.22-5.62) and Lurchers (OR = 3.49, 95% CI 1.50-8.11) had increased odds of diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Leptospirosis is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice, suggesting that many true cases may be missed. Demographic risk factors identified here may inform the index of suspicion and encourage increased use of confirmatory diagnostic testing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lindsay, B</author><author>Cook, D</author><author>Wetzel, J-M</author><author>Siess, S</author><author>Moses, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brachycephalic airway syndrome: management of post-operative respiratory  complications in 248 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>173-180</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Airway Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Period</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32037517</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.12926</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: As ownership of brachycephalic dog breeds rises, the surgical  correction of components of brachycephalic airway syndrome (BAS) is increasingly recommended by veterinarians. This study's objective was to describe the incidence of, and strategies for the management of post-operative respiratory complications in brachycephalic dogs undergoing surgical correction of one or more components of BAS. METHODS: Medical records of 248 brachycephalic dogs treated surgically for BAS were retrospectively reviewed for demographic information, procedures performed, post-operative complications and treatment implemented, hospitalisation time, and necessity for further surgery. RESULTS: Pugs, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and British Bulldogs were the most commonly encountered breeds. Dogs which experienced a complication were significantly older (mean was 5.5 years, compared with 4.1 years [P &lt; 0.01]). Fifty-eight dogs (23.4%) had complications which included: dyspnoea managed with supplemental oxygen alone (7.3%, n = 18), dyspnoea requiring anaesthesia and re-intubation (8.9%, n = 22), dyspnoea necessitating treatment with a temporary tracheostomy (8.9%, n = 22), aspiration pneumonia (4%, n = 10), and respiratory or cardiac arrest (2.4%, n = 6). Five of the 22 dogs requiring anaesthesia and re-intubation deteriorated 12 or more hours after post-surgical anaesthetic recovery. The overall mortality rate in this study was 2.4% (n = 6). Age, concurrent airway pathology, and emergency presentation significantly predicted post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Our data show the importance of close monitoring for a minimum of 24 h following surgery by an experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician. Surgical intervention for BAS symptomatic dogs should be considered at an earlier age as an elective procedure, to reduce the risk of post-operative complications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Violette, Nathaniel P</author><author>Ledbetter, Eric C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Punctate retinal hemorrhage and its relation to ocular and systemic disease in  dogs: 83 cases.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>233-239</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Complications</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Diseases</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypertension</keyword><keyword>Hyperthyroidism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Renal Insufficiency, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Retinal Hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>28799185</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12496</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical aspects of dogs with punctate retinal hemorrhage  (PRH). ANIMALS STUDIED: 83 dogs (119 eyes) with PRH. PROCEDURES: Medical records of dogs evaluated by the Cornell University ophthalmology service with a clinical diagnosis of PRH between 2006 and 2015 were reviewed. For this study, PRH was defined as retinal hemorrhages ≤ 1 optic disk diameter in size and dogs with other posterior segment ocular diseases were excluded. Signalment and clinical features of the dogs were recorded, including concurrent ocular and systemic diseases. RESULTS: Punctate retinal hemorrhage was identified in 119 eyes of 83 dogs. The mean (±standard deviation) age of dogs was 10.0 (±3.8) years. Mixed-breed dogs, Golden Retrievers, Jack Russell Terriers, and English Springer Spaniels were statistically overrepresented relative to the ophthalmology service canine referral population during the same period. Hemorrhages were found in all retinal locations and varied in number. Concurrent ocular disease was present in 78 eyes (66%) including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, uveitis, and cataracts. Fifty dogs (60%) suffered from concurrent systemic disease and diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, and systemic hypertension were statistically overrepresented in the PRH population. Less frequently, other serious systemic diseases were present in dogs with PRH including immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, leptospirosis, metastatic neoplasia, and thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of PRH in dogs may be increased by certain ocular and systemic diseases. As the presence of PRH can be associated with underlying systemic disease in dogs, it may prompt further clinical investigation and diagnostics.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roels, E</author><author>Krafft, E</author><author>Antoine, N</author><author>Farnir, F</author><author>Laurila, H P</author><author>Holopainen, S</author><author>Rajamäki, M M</author><author>Clercx, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2, serotonin, and vascular endothelial  growth factor serum concentrations in healthy dogs from seven breeds with variable predisposition for canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>57-62</pages><volume>101</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CCL2</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-8</keyword><keyword>Serotonin</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26267090</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.05.020</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The West Highland white terrier (WHWT) is particularly prone to canine idiopathic  pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF). We hypothesized that higher circulating concentrations of chemokines CXCL8, CCL2, serotonin (5-HT), or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could serve as predisposing factors for CIPF development in the WHWT breed. Serum samples from 103 healthy dogs of seven different breeds variably predisposed to CIPF were collected. Serum CXCL8 concentrations were higher in healthy WHWT compared with each of the other groups of healthy dogs. Serum CCL2 concentrations were higher in healthy WHWT and Maltese compared with King Charles spaniels and Malinois Belgian shepherds. No relevant inter-breed differences were observed for serum 5-HT concentrations regarding CIPF predisposition. VEGF values from 89.3% of samples tested were below the kit detection limit. In conclusion, high CXCL8 blood concentrations and possibly CCL2 concentrations might be related to the breed predisposition of the WHWT for CIPF and warrants further investigations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grützner, Niels</author><author>Heilmann, Romy M</author><author>Stupka, Kenneth C</author><author>Rangachari, Venkat R</author><author>Weber, Katja</author><author>Holzenburg, Andreas</author><author>Suchodolski, Jan S</author><author>Steiner, Jörg M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentrations in Chinese Shar-Pei dogs  with cobalamin deficiency.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>420-426</pages><volume>197</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Homocysteine</keyword><keyword>Methylmalonic Acid</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Vitamin B 12 Deficiency</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23499543</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.02.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cobalamin deficiency is suspected to be hereditary in Chinese Shar-Pei dogs  (Shar-Peis), and inherited causes of cobalamin deficiency may affect the cellular processing of cobalamin. In humans, a defect of the two main cobalamin-dependent intracellular enzymes (i.e., methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase) may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and hypermethylmalonic acidemia. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate serum homocysteine (HCY) and methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations in cobalamin-deficient Shar-Peis and dogs of six other breeds. Serum samples (n=297) from cobalamin-deficient dogs (Shar-Peis, German Shepherd dogs, Labrador Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, Boxers, Cocker Spaniels, and Beagles) were analyzed for serum HCY and MMA concentrations. A Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate if cobalamin deficiency in Shar-Peis is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Serum HCY and MMA concentrations were higher in cobalamin-deficient Shar-Peis compared to cobalamin-deficient dogs of the six other breeds (P&lt;0.0001). Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with cobalamin deficiency in Shar-Peis (P=0.009). In addition, serum HCY and MMA concentrations did not differ between cobalamin-deficient German Shepherd dogs with and without exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a potential cause of secondary cobalamin deficiency. These findings suggest that the function of the two intracellular cobalamin-dependent enzymes is impaired in Shar-Peis with cobalamin deficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pouchelon, J-L</author><author>Jamet, N</author><author>Gouni, V</author><author>Tissier, R</author><author>Serres, F</author><author>Carlos Sampedrano, C</author><author>Castaignet, M</author><author>Lefebvre, H P</author><author>Chetboul, V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of benazepril on survival and cardiac events in dogs with asymptomatic  mitral valve disease: a retrospective study of 141 cases.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>905-914</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzazepines</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Longevity</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18482278</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0105.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve quality of  life and extend the life span of dogs with naturally acquired ISACHC class II-III congestive heart failure (CHF). However, their effects on asymptomatic heart disease remain controversial. HYPOTHESIS: Benazepril (BNZ), an ACEI, could have beneficial effects at the asymptomatic stage of degenerative mitral valve disease (MVD). ANIMALS: Dogs with ISACHC class Ia MVD and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) assessed by the color Doppler mapping technique at entry (Day 0) were retrospectively included. METHODS: Dogs were assigned to the treated group (BNZ group) if they received BNZ (and no other cardiac medication) from Day 0 or to the untreated group (UT group) if they did not receive any cardioactive treatment until occurrence of CHF. RESULTS: A total of 141 dogs were included in the study, 66 in the BNZ group (dosage: 0.30 +/- 0.13 mg/kg) and 75 in the UT group. In the population (n = 93) including all breeds except Cavalier (CKC) and King Charles Spaniels (KC), median survival time to all causes of death in the BNZ group (n = 34, 3.3 years) was significantly longer than in the UT group (n = 59, 1.9 years) as was time to cardiac event (P &lt; .05). Conversely, no effect of the BNZ treatment was observed in the CKC and KC population. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: BNZ had beneficial effects in asymptomatic dogs other than CKC and KC affected by MVD with moderate-to-severe MR. Breed distribution should be taken into account for interpretation of clinical trials performed in dogs with cardiac disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saridomichelakis, M N</author><author>Koutinas, A F</author><author>Gioulekas, D</author><author>Leontidis, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine atopic dermatitis in Greece: clinical observations and the prevalence of  positive intradermal test reactions in 91 spontaneous cases.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</full-title></periodical><pages>61-73</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Atopic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Greece</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Skin Tests</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10490235</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00040-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Atopic dermatitis was diagnosed in a total of 91 dogs by combining the compatible  historical evidence and clinical signs with the presence of one or more positive intradermal test reactions well correlated with the exposure to the aeroallergens and the seasonality of the clinical signs. Compared to the general hospital population Yorkshire terriers, Chinese Shar-Peis and cocker spaniels showed a strong predilection. No such predilection was found regarding the sex of the animals. The age of the dogs at the onset of the clinical signs ranged from 2 months to 8 years (median: 2.5 years). Moderate to severe pruritus, noticed in all the 91 dogs, was either localized (29/91) or generalized (64/91) and non-seasonal (43/91), seasonal (19/91) or of unknown seasonality (29/91). The most common cutaneous lesions included erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypotrichosis and crusts; their body distribution was generalized (64%) or localized (36%) with the feet as the most common site of involvement. Five dogs that had unlesional skin were significantly younger and had been pruritic for a shorter period of time compared to the majority of our study population. Otitis externa (43/91) and bacterial pyoderma (30/91) were the most common conditions associated with atopic dermatitis, while the prevalence of Malassezia dermatitis was very low (2/91). Of the other allergic skin diseases flea allergic dermatitis was the most common (29/91) followed by food hypersensitivity (2 out of the 15 dogs tested). The majority of the dogs demonstrated multiple sensitivities to the 50 aeroallergens tested, while domestic mites (77/91), and particularly Dermatophagoides farinae (64/91), were the most commonly implicated. The total number of the positive intradermal test reactions was increasing parallel to the age of the dogs but it was negatively associated with the presence of skin lesions on the carpal and tarsal joints.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kramer, G A</author><author>Kittleson, M D</author><author>Fox, P R</author><author>Lewis, J</author><author>Pion, P D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasma taurine concentrations in normal dogs and in dogs with heart disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>253-258</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anticoagulants</keyword><keyword>Blood Specimen Collection</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Taurine</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8523322</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.1995.tb01076.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Plasma taurine concentrations were determined in 76 dogs with dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM), 28 dogs with acquired valvular disease (AVD), and 47 normal (control) dogs. The data were collected at 2 referral centers, The Animal Medical Center, New York, NY (AMC), and the University of California, Davis (UCD), and the studies were conducted independently. Different anticoagulants (sodium citrate at AMC and lithium heparin at UCD) were used to collect the plasma samples. Paired analysis of samples showed a significant difference in plasma taurine concentrations, depending on the anticoagulant used. Consequently, results from each clinic were analyzed separately. Plasma taurine concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with AVD (median, 133 nmol/mL; range, 25 to 229 nmol/mL) than in control dogs (median, 63 nmol/mL; range 44 to 224 nmol/mL) and dogs with DCM (median, 72 nmol/mL; range, 1 to 247 nmol/mL) at AMC (P &lt; .001). The number of dogs with AVD at UCD was too small to draw meaningful conclusions. At UCD, the median plasma taurine concentration was 98 nmol/mL (range, 28-169 nmol/mL) in dogs with AVD, 75 nmol/mL (range, 0.1-184 nmol/mL) in dogs with DCM, and 88 nmol/mL (range 52-180 nmol/mL) in control dogs. There were no significant differences in plasma taurine concentrations between dogs with DCM and the control dogs at either hospital. Congestive heart failure and administration of cardiac medication had no significant effect on plasma taurine concentrations. Plasma taurine concentration was low (&lt; 25 nmol/mL) in 17% (13/76) of the dogs with DCM. Seven of the 13 dogs with low plasma taurine concentrations were Cocker Spaniels or Golden Retrievers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glickman, L T</author><author>Domanski, L M</author><author>Patronek, G J</author><author>Visintainer, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed-related risk factors for canine parvovirus enteritis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>589-594</pages><volume>187</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enteritis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Parvoviridae Infections</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year></dates><accession-num>3003015</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Case records of 305 dogs with canine parvovirus (CPV) enteritis, seen at the  Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from July 1, 1981 to Aug 31, 1982, were selected on the basis of admitting diagnoses or signs of diarrhea and vomiting. The case records were subdivided into 3 diagnostic categories, based on final diagnoses and laboratory test results. There were 96 dogs with definite CPV enteritis, 139 with possible CPV enteritis, and 70 with unlikely CPV enteritis. These cases were then stratified by animal's age (less than or equal to 6 months or greater than 6 months) and specific hospital service (medicine or emergency). A control group was selected from all canine case records from the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for conditions other than the criteria used in selecting the case group. Approximately 2 hospital patients were selected for each CPV enteritis case by frequency matching for hospital service and age. The proportion of dogs with definite CPV enteritis that had each of the clinical signs that were studied was greater than that of dogs in the other CPV enteritis diagnostic categories. The overall survival rate for dogs with definite CPV enteritis was 64.0%; survival was not associated with any given clinical sign of disease. Odds ratios (OR) for the risk of CPV enteritis were calculated for breeds with 3 or more dogs with definite CPV enteritis. The Doberman Pinschers (OR = 3.1), Rottweilers (OR = 6.0), and English Springer Spaniels (OR = 8.1) had a significantly increased risk of CPV enteritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danesi, Patrizia</author><author>Ravagnan, Silvia</author><author>Johnson, Lynelle R</author><author>Furlanello, Tommaso</author><author>Milani, Adelaide</author><author>Martin, Patricia</author><author>Boyd, Susan</author><author>Best, Matthew</author><author>Galgut, Bradley</author><author>Irwin, Peter</author><author>Canfield, Paul J</author><author>Krockenberger, Mark B</author><author>Halliday, Catriona</author><author>Meyer, Wieland</author><author>Malik, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Medical mycology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical mycology</full-title></periodical><pages>828-842</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Mycological Typing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Pneumocystis carinii</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA, Mitochondrial</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28339756</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/mmy/myx007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening fungal disease that can occur  in dogs. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary genetic characterisation of Pneumocystis carinii f.sp.'canis' (P. canis) in dogs and thereby develop a reliable molecular protocol to definitively diagnose canine PCP. We investigated P. canis in a variety of lung specimens from dogs with confirmed or strongly suspected PCP (Group 1, n = 16), dogs with non-PCP lower respiratory tract problems (Group 2, n = 65) and dogs not suspected of having PCP or other lower respiratory diseases (Group 3, n = 11). Presence of Pneumocystis DNA was determined by nested PCR of the large and small mitochondrial subunit rRNA loci and by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay developed using a new set of primers. Molecular results were correlated with the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes detected in cytological/histological preparations. Pneumocystis DNA was amplified from 13/16 PCP-suspected dogs (Group 1) and from 4/76 dogs of control Groups 2 and 3 (combined). The latter four dogs were thought to have been colonized by P. canis. Comparison of CT values in 'infected' versus 'colonized' dogs was consistent with this notion, with a distinct difference in molecular burden between groups (CT ≤ 26 versus CT range (26 &lt;CT &lt; 35), respectively). Phylogenetic analyses showed that P. canis is specifically 'canine' associated, being separated from other mammalian Pneumocystis species, thereby confirming the accuracy of qPCR amplicon for Pneumocystis in dogs. Using qPCR, Pneumocystis DNA can be detected in specimens from the respiratory tract and a CT value can be interpreted to distinguish infection versus colonization.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belmudes, Audrey</author><author>Pressanti, Charline</author><author>Barthez, Paul Y</author><author>Castilla-Castaño, Eloy</author><author>Fabries, Lionel</author><author>Cadiergues, Marie C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomographic findings in 205 dogs with clinical signs compatible with  middle ear disease: a retrospective study.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>45-e20</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>28994490</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vde.12503</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is considered to be the reference method to  evaluate middle ear structures. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and severity of CT changes in the middle ear and establish if any specific clinical presentations are associated with otitis media. ANIMALS: Medical records of animals referred for CT with history and clinical signs consistent with middle ear disease. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of CT examinations of tympanic bullae performed over a six year period. Medical records were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs and cytological evaluation of the external ear canal. Dogs were divided into three clinical groups: chronic otitis externa (Group 1), peripheral vestibular disorder (Group 2) and other clinical presentations (Group 3). RESULTS: Group 1 - Of 214 ears, 87 (40.7%) had CT abnormalities: 38 of 87 (17.7%) had material-filled bullae, 42 of 87 (19.6%) had thickened bullae walls and seven of 87 (3.2%) had lysis of the bulla. Abnormalities were significantly more frequent in dogs with suppurative otitis than in erythemato-ceruminous otitis (57% and 23%, respectively; P = 0.003). Proliferative otitis, particularly in French bulldogs, was associated with severe otitis media. Group 2 - Of the 106 ears, 91 (85.8%) had normal tympanic bullae. Group 3 - Of the 26 ears from deaf dogs, 17 had filled bullae; all nine affected dogs were Cavalier King Charles spaniels. All dogs with Claude Bernard Horner syndrome or head tilt had normal tympanic bullae. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CT is useful for canine chronic otitis externa, particularly in suppurative or proliferative otitis, even in the absence of associated neurological signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gelain, Maria Elena</author><author>Bertazzolo, Walter</author><author>Tutino, Giuseppina</author><author>Pogliani, Elena</author><author>Cian, Francesco</author><author>Boudreaux, Mary K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel point mutation in the β1-tubulin gene in asymptomatic  macrothrombocytopenic Norfolk and Cairn Terriers.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>317-321</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>Tubulin</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25060661</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12168</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: An asymptomatic macrothrombocytopenia, phenotypically similar to  asymptomatic inherited macrothrombocytopenia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, was described in a group of Norfolk Terriers (NT) from Northern Italy, and isolated cases were also reported in Cairn Terriers (CT). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to evaluate for the presence of a genetic defect in the β1-tubulin gene in macrothrombocytopenic NT and CT. METHODS: Samples from 20 healthy dogs (13 NT and 7 CT) were collected at different institutions in Italy (n = 8), United Kingdom (n = 3), and United States (n = 9). Genomic DNA was harvested from EDTA-anticoagulated blood and all coding areas and exon-intron splice sites in the gene encoding β1-tubulin were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: Twelve dogs (9 NT and 3 CT) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 1 at nucleotide position 5 (G5A) that would result in the change of an arginine to a histidine at amino acid position 2 (R2H). Four dogs (3 NT and one Cairn Terrier) were heterozygous for the SNP, and 4 dogs (one Norfolk Terrier and 3 CT) matched the normal canine genome. Homozygous dogs for the SNP were macrothrombocytopenic with platelet counts ranging from 19,000 to 110,000/μL. Heterozygous and normal dogs had normal platelet counts and morphology. None had the CKCS point mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The β1-tubulin N-terminal amino acids form the nucleotide-binding domain and thus this mutation could affect GTP binding enough to influence platelet formation in homozygous but not in heterozygous dogs. The presence of macrothrombocytopenia only in homozygous affected dogs reveals an association between the SNP and the phenotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hezzell, Melanie J</author><author>Boswood, Adrian</author><author>Chang, Yu-Mei</author><author>Moonarmart, Walasinee</author><author>Elliott, Jonathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associations among serum N-terminal procollagen type III concentration, urinary  aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio, and ventricular remodeling in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1765-1774</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Aldosterone</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments</keyword><keyword>Procollagen</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Remodeling</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23106462</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.73.11.1765</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To assess relationships among serum N-terminal procollagen type III  concentration, urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine concentration ratio (UAC), and clinical variables in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 162 dogs with MMVD and 24 healthy control dogs of comparable age and body weight. PROCEDURES: Blood and urine samples were collected from each dog. Dogs with MMVD underwent echocardiography and ECG. Ventricular diameter measurements were normalized for body weight. Serum N-terminal procollagen type III and urinary aldosterone concentrations were measured via radioimmunoassay. Each dog was examined on 1 to 3 occasions. Examinations were repeated at approximately 6-month intervals. RESULTS: Serum N-terminal procollagen type III concentration decreased with increasing severity of MMVD and was negatively associated with age and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters. The UAC increased with prior percentage change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter per month, subsequent percentage change in left ventricular end-systolic diameter per month, and treatment with diuretics and was negatively associated with age. Both UAC and serum N-terminal procollagen type III concentration were higher in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels than in other breeds when other measured variables were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In dogs with MMVD, echocardiographic indicators of left ventricular remodeling appeared to be associated with a decrease in serum concentration of a marker of collagen type III turnover and an increase in urinary aldosterone concentration.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gordon, Sonya G</author><author>Saunders, Ashley B</author><author>Hariu, Crystal D</author><author>Boggess, May M</author><author>Miller, Matthew W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrospective review of carvedilol administration in 38 dogs with preclinical  chronic valvular heart disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>243-252</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenergic beta-Antagonists</keyword><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carbazoles</keyword><keyword>Carvedilol</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Propanolamines</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22364694</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2012.01.007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Report the effect of carvedilol administration on clinical and  echocardiographic parameters and outcome in dogs with preclinical (ACVIM Stage B) chronic valvular heart disease (CVD). ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective case series of 38 client-owned dogs. Demographic, physical examination and diagnostic imaging findings, blood pressure (BP), administration details and outcome were obtained from medical records of dogs receiving carvedilol for preclinical CVD. When possible, additional follow-up information was obtained through telephone interviews with referring veterinarians and owners. RESULTS: Baseline data and follow-up were evaluated. Median and interquartile range (IQR) for age and weight were 8.6 (7.2-10.8) years and 8.5 (7.6-9.6)kg. 14/38 were male; 33/38 were Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; 33/38 had Stage B2 CVD. The initial dose of carvedilol was 0.31 (0.26-0.35)mg/kg PO twice daily. The carvedilol dose achieved following up titration was 1.11 (0.81-1.32)mg/kg twice daily. No adverse effects were recorded during up titration. Median survival for all dogs was 48.5 months with a 95% CI of 38.3-58.6. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that carvedilol at the dose reported herein is well tolerated in small breed dogs with preclinical CVD. Prospective studies to evaluate efficacy are warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weinkle, Tristan K</author><author>Center, Sharon A</author><author>Randolph, John F</author><author>Warner, Karen L</author><author>Barr, Stephen C</author><author>Erb, Hollis N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of prognostic factors, survival rates, and treatment protocols for  immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in dogs: 151 cases (1993-2002).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1869-1880</pages><volume>226</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aspirin</keyword><keyword>Azathioprine</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glucocorticoids</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Survival Rate</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15934255</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2005.226.1869</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prognostic factors, survival, and treatment protocols for  immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 151 dogs with IMHA not associated with underlying infectious or neoplastic disease. PROCEDURE: lnformation recorded from review of medical records included signalment at the time of initial evaluation; vaccination history; 30-, 60-, and 365-day follow-up outcomes; laboratory data; results of imaging studies; and necropsy findings. Dogs were grouped according to the presence of spherocytes, autoagglutination, a regenerative erythrocyte response, and treatments received (azathioprine, azathioprine plus ultralow-dose aspirin, azathioprine plus mixed-molecular-weight heparin [mHEP], or azathioprine plus ultralow-dose aspirin plus mHEP) for comparisons. All dogs received glucocorticoids. RESULTS: Cocker Spaniels, Miniature Schnauzers, neutered dogs, and female dogs were overrepresented. Alterations in certain clinicopathologic variables were associated with increased mortality rate. Rates of survival following treatment with azathioprine, azathioprine plus ultralow-dose aspirin, azathioprine plus mHEP, and azathioprine plus ultralow-dose aspirin plus mHEP were 74%, 88%, 23%, and 70%, respectively, at hospital discharge; 57%, 82%, 17%, and 67%, respectively, at 30 days; and 45%, 69%, 17%, and 64%, respectively, at 1 year. In comparison, mean survival rates at discharge and at 30 days and 1 year after evaluation collated from 7 published reviews of canine IMHA were 57%, 58%, and 34%, respectively.

We report the results of complex segregation analysis performed in families of 357 consecutive newborns affected with nonsyndromic CP (i.e., CP not a component feature of malformation syndrome, sequence or association), and registered in the North East Italy and Emilia Romagna congenital malformation registries in the period 1981-1993. This sample, based on a large number of consecutive births, in a well-defined geographical area, with quality control to detect associated anomalies and malformation syndromes, is independent of the number of affected subjects in the family and of CP severity, fitness, and survival. We have analyzed, using the mixed model, the whole sample of nonsyndromic CP, including isolated (i.e., without other anomalies) CP (CPI) and CP associated with at least one other anomaly (CPA), for which a diagnosis of malformation syndrome was not possible. When nonsyndromic CP (including CPA) are considered in the analysis, there is no heterogeneity between CPA and CPI nor between CP including hard palate (CPH) and CP of the soft palate only (CPS). POINTER and COMDS programs cannot discriminate between alternative genetic models; only the hypothesis of non-genetic transmission is rejected. The COMDS analysis two-locus model, which indicates that a modifier locus (or loci) operates in addition to a single major locus (SML), does not show evidence of better fit than SML, polygenic, and multifactorial models. When the severity parameter (defined as CPH and CPS) is added, CPI and CPA show heterogeneity. Eventually, when the analysis is limited to CPI and includes information on severity, a recessive SML, with low penetrance and determining CPH, provides a significant best fit. To have defined a genetic model for CPI and provided evidence for SML inheritance suggests that genetic linkage studies could be implemented. This conclusion is in agreement with previous studies which showed a significant association between alleles of transforming growth factor alpha and CP only in humans, and that single recessive genes may play a crucial role during palatogenesis in mice as well as in Brittany spaniels. Application of the candidate genes to human CPH families could reveal whether these genes are involved.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Celona, Bartolo</author><author>Crinò, Chiara</author><author>Bruno, Carmelo</author><author>Di Pietro, Simona</author><author>Giudice, Elisabetta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Renal Amyloidosis Associated With Kartagener Syndrome in a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>61-65</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Amyloidosis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchiectasis</keyword><keyword>Bronchitis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Kartagener Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Kidney Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sinusitis</keyword><keyword>Situs Inversus</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28992906</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.tcam.2017.03.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 4-year-old cocker spaniel, male, of 12kg body weight was presented because of  the onset of polyuria or polydipsia. From the first months of its life, the dog had exhibited constant serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, productive cough, sneezing, reverse sneezing, otitis, and recurrent episodes of fever. The respiratory signs had been treated several times with antibiotics, without ever achieving a complete resolution. Clinical examination revealed normal rectal temperature (38.3°C), increased respiratory rate (40breaths/min), a copious mucous nasal discharge and right deviation of the heart apex beat (ictus cordis). Increased respiratory sounds with moist rales and crackles were found on chest auscultation. An increase in serum creatinine, urea and phosphorus, hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria were found. Lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs of the thorax and of the abdomen showed the transposition of the heart, with the cardiac apex pointing toward the right (dextrocardia), bronchointerstitial lung pattern, areas of consolidation, lesions consistent with bronchiectasis caves and a mirror-image of abdominal organs, confirming the diagnosis of complete situs inversus (CSI). Respiratory signs, combined with CSI, suggested the diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome (KS). Abdominal ultrasound showed an increase in the echogenicity of the renal parenchyma, a loss of definition of the corticomedullary line, slight bilateral pyelectasis, and decreased cortical perfusion. The dog died 2 months later because of a further worsening of the clinical condition. Necroscopy demonstrated the existence of CSI, rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, and bronchiectasis, so confirming the diagnosis of KS, and renal amyloidosis. This is the first case reported in veterinary medicine of the presence of renal amyloidosis together with KS in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Silva, E O</author><author>Goiozo, P F I</author><author>Pereira, L G</author><author>Headley, S A</author><author>Bracarense, A F R L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Concomitant Malignant Pulmonary Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumour and Benign  Cutaneous Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumour in a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>46-50</pages><volume>157</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms, Multiple Primary</keyword><keyword>Neurilemmoma</keyword><keyword>Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28735670</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.05.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Peripheral nerve sheath tumours (PNSTs) are neoplastic growths derived from  Schwann cells, perineural cells or both.

Grossly, there was a large infiltrative mass in the caudal lobe of the right lung; smaller nodules were observed in the other lobes of the right lung. Furthermore, a small encapsulated cutaneous nodule was observed on the left hindlimb. Histopathology of the pulmonary tumours revealed the proliferation of pleomorphic spindle-shaped cells with moderate mitotic index arranged in interwoven bundles and concentric Antoni A and Antoni B patterns; invasion of the adjacent pulmonary tissue was observed. The cutaneous nodule consisted of neoplastic mesenchymal cells in interwoven bundles with concentric whorls, but without the marked anisokaryosis, binucleation and infiltrative growth seen in the pulmonary tumour. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both tumours were immunoreactive for vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100 protein, but were negative for factor VIII. These findings are indicative of a MPNST in the lung with a concomitant benign PNST in the limb. This case represents the first report of a primary MPNST in the lung of a dog. This neoplastic growth should be included in the differential diagnosis of primary malignant pulmonary tumours of dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laprais, Aurore F</author><author>Bizikova, Petra</author><author>Lashnits, Erin W</author><author>Tucker, Alison</author><author>Linder, Keith E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scleromyxoedema in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>503-e119</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Scleromyxedema</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>Skin Diseases</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28439995</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vde.12447</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In humans, scleromyxoedema is a chronic progressive skin condition  traditionally characterized by deposits of mucin, increased number of fibroblasts and fibrosis in the skin, and by systemic disease. Thyroid disease is typically absent. A monoclonal gammopathy is usually present, as are other comorbidities. Descriptions of scleromyxoedema in the veterinary literature are limited to a single feline case. One dog, previously reported as having papular mucinosis, exhibited features that matched the more current diagnostic criteria of scleromyxoedema. OBJECTIVES: To describe generalized papular mucinosis in a dog with systemic illness and to compare the signs with those of human lichen myxoedematosus conditions, specifically scleromyxoedema. RESULTS: A nine-year-old female, spayed English springer spaniel dog presented with generalized papules and nodules (0.5-5 cm) on the body and proximal fore and hind limbs, sparing the face and distal limbs distal to carpi/tarsi. Larger nodules were erythematous. Nodules occurred in proximal limb muscles. The dog had concurrent osteoarthritis of the elbows and coxofemoral joints, developed generalized weakness, declined in health and was euthanized. Thyroid disease was lacking and a monoclonal gammopathy was not present. Histopathological evaluation revealed the classic triad of mucin, fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis with very mild inflammation, as described for humans. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We document scleromyxoedema in a dog with significant morbidity and features of the human disease. Recognizing the typical histopathology is important for identifying cases and to establish a diagnosis. Systemic evaluation is important to identify evidence of internal disease and associated comorbidities, which are common, variable, and impact classification and prognosis in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ljungvall, I</author><author>Höglund, K</author><author>Lilliehöök, I</author><author>Oyama, M A</author><author>Tidholm, A</author><author>Tvedten, H</author><author>Häggström, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serum serotonin concentration is associated with severity of myxomatous mitral  valve disease in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1105-1112</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Serotonin</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23865457</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12137</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has  recently been suggested to play a role in the development of naturally acquired myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs. AIM: To investigate the association between serum 5-HT concentration and MMVD severity in dogs, and to assess potential associations between serum 5-HT concentrations and dog characteristics, echocardiographic variables, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, presence of macrothrombocytosis, and plateletcrit. ANIMALS: A total of 120 client-owned dogs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dogs were prospectively recruited and were classified by standard echocardiography into healthy (dogs of breeds predisposed to MMVD, but without echocardiographic evidence of the disease), mild, moderate, or severe MMVD groups. Serum 5-HT concentrations were analyzed using an ELISA. RESULTS: Dogs with severe MMVD had lower serum 5-HT concentrations than healthy dogs (P = .0025) and dogs with mild MMVD (P = .0011). Unilinear and multiple regression analyses showed that serum 5-HT concentrations decreased with increasing left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao), were higher in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs compared to dogs of other breeds, and were higher in female dogs than in male dogs. The LA/Ao was the variable most strongly associated with serum 5-HT concentration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The finding of higher serum 5-HT concentrations in dogs of breeds predisposed to the early onset of MMVD (CKCS) and dogs with mild MMVD suggests that alterations in 5-HT signaling might play a role in progression of early stages of MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Xiao-Hui</author><author>Xu, Han-Kun</author><author>Mao, Da-Gan</author><author>Ma, Da-Jun</author><author>Chen, Peng</author><author>Yang, Li-Guo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Association between the canine monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) gene polymorphisms and  behavior of puppies in open-field test].</title><secondary-title>Yi chuan = Hereditas</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Yi chuan = Hereditas</full-title></periodical><pages>1376-1382</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Exploratory Behavior</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Least-Squares Analysis</keyword><keyword>Monoamine Oxidase</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>17098705</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1360/yc-006-1376</electronic-resource-num><language>chi</language><urls/><abstract>Excitability, activity and exploration behavior of puppies in a novel open-field  were tested in a total of 204 two-month-old German shepherd dog, labrador retriever or English springer spaniel puppies. The polymorphisms of monoamine oxidase B gene (MAOB) were detected by PCR-RFLP. Statistics analysis indicated that genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms were significantly different among three breeds (P &lt; 0.01). With GLM analysis of SAS software, association analysis was conducted between MAOB gene polymorphisms and locomotion and vocalization behavior parameters in the open-field test. The results showed that MAOB gene polymorphisms had a significant effect on walking time, squares crossed, lying time, the times of standing up against walls(P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05) and were associated with the times of posture change (P=0.064). Walking time and squares crossed were higher in TT genotype puppies than those in TC and CC puppies (P &lt; 0.05) and the times of posture change and standing up against walls were also higher than those in CC (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, lying time in CC genotype puppies were higher than that in TT (P &lt; 0.05). MAOB had a positive effect on walking time, lying time, squares crossed, the times of posture change, the times of standing up against walls in the three dog breeds that was highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05). Our results imply that MAOB gene significantly affects the excitability, activity and exploration behavior of puppies in open-field test and TT genotype has favorable effects in these behavior traits.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nuttall, T J</author><author>Malham, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Successful intravenous human immunoglobulin treatment of drug-induced  Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>357-361</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Infective Agents</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulins, Intravenous</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Surgical Wound Infection</keyword><keyword>Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15266858</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2004.tb00248.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A two-year-old, male English springer spaniel developed severe mucocutaneous  ulceration following treatment with trimethoprim-potentiated sulphadiazine. The clinical signs were consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS): there were no target or arciform lesions typical of erythema multiforme minor and major; more than one mucosal surface was affected; epidermal detachment affected less than 10 per cent of the body surface area; and there was a clear history of drug exposure. Systemic signs included a severe hepatopathy, dyspnoea, pyrexia and cachexia. Glucocorticoid therapy was associated with secondary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The clinical signs rapidly resolved following a single intravenous infusion of 0.51 g/kg human immunoglobulin (ivHIG) as a 5 per cent solution. By blocking FAS/FAS ligand (CD95/CD95L) interactions, ivHIG is thought to prevent keratinocyte apoptosis. It also binds to immunoglobulin G Fc receptors, inhibiting cell activation and cytokine synthesis, neutralises autoantibodies and immune complexes, blocks complement activity, is antimicrobial and increases colloid osmotic pressure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of successful treatment of canine SJS using ivHIG, although it has been used to treat erythema multiforme in a cat and toxic epidermal necrolysis in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsen, Dennis</author><author>Harkin, Kenneth R</author><author>Banwell, Max N</author><author>Andrews, Gordon A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postoperative rupture of an aortic aneurysmal dilation associated with a patent  ductus arteriosus in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>259-265</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aortic Rupture</keyword><keyword>Dilatation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11994854</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/jvet.2002.32453</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe an unusual case of fatal aortic aneurysm rupture after  standard ligation of a left-to-right shunting patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and review the literature concerning the causes of aneurysm and applicable medical physics of blood flow that may contribute to mural failure. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical case report. SAMPLE POPULATION: An 11-month-old female Brittany spaniel. RESULTS: A PDA was diagnosed in the dog after referral for a grade IV/IV cardiac murmur. Diagnostic tests performed included a minimum database, thoracic radiography, and echocardiography. Conventional surgical ligation of the PDA was performed. The postoperative recovery from anesthesia was uneventful. Approximately 5 hours after surgery, the dog vocalized once and collapsed. All resuscitative efforts failed. Necropsy showed a large, spiral rupture of the cranial and dorsal wall of the aorta that extended from the left subclavian artery to 2 cm distal to the PDA-aorta junction. No evidence of intramural, perianeurysmal hemorrhage or inflammation was noted. Histopathologic examination of the ruptured aneurysm showed that the wall lacked a defined tunica intima and endothelial cell layer. A distinct separation of the thinned tunica media parallel to the elastic fibers was noted. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dilatation of the aorta near the area of a PDA is one of the recognized abnormalities associated with the condition. Aneurysmal dilatation results from and contributes to abnormal blood flow dynamics and increased aortic wall tension, which promotes expansion. Although an unusual and previously unreported sequela, rupture of the aneurysm should be considered a possible complication when ligation of a PDA with a conspicuous aortic aneurysmal dilation is performed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dekomien, G</author><author>Runte, M</author><author>Gödde, R</author><author>Epplen, J T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalized progressive retinal atrophy of Sloughi dogs is due to an 8-bp  insertion in exon 21 of the PDE6B gene.</title><secondary-title>Cytogenetics and cell genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cytogenetics and cell genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>261-267</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 6</keyword><keyword>DNA Mutational Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Introns</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Insertional</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Protein Subunits</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11124530</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000056785</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We investigated the gene encoding the beta subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase  (PDE6B) as a candidate for generalized progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA), an autosomal recessively transmitted eye disease in dogs. The PDE6B gene was isolated from a genomic library. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis revealed eight intronic variations in different subsets of the 14 dog breeds investigated. In addition, we identified an 8-bp insertion after codon 816 in certain Sloughi dogs. Analysis of PRA-affected and obligatory carrier Sloughis showed that this mutation cosegregates with disease status in a large pedigree. All other exchanges identified were not located in functionally relevant parts of the gene (e.g., in the splice signal consensus sites). In most dog breeds (Labrador retriever, Tibetan mastiff, dachshund, Tibetan terrier, miniature poodle, Australian cattle dog, cocker spaniel, collie, Saarloos wolfhound, Chesapeake Bay retriever, and Yorkshire terrier), PDE6B was excluded as a candidate gene for gPRA because heterozygous allele constellations were detected in diseased animals. Therefore, the PDE6B sequence variations did not segregate together with the mutation(s) causing gPRA. Direct and indirect DNA tests concerning gPRA can be offered now for a variety of different dog breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gutierrez-Quintana, Rodrigo</author><author>Mellersh, Cathryn</author><author>Wessmann, Annette</author><author>Ortega, Maria</author><author>Penderis, Jacques</author><author>Sharpe, Samuel</author><author>Freeman, Eleanor</author><author>Stevenson, Lynn</author><author>Burmeister, Louise</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy in a family of mixed breed dogs  associated with a novel RETREG1 variant.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2306-2314</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies</keyword><keyword>Heterozygote</keyword><keyword>Homozygote</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>Whole Genome Sequencing</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34387380</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16242</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs) are a group of  genetic disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system. Two different associated variants have been identified in dogs: 1 in Border Collies and 1 in Spaniels and Pointers. OBJECTIVES: Clinically and genetically characterize HSAN in a family of mixed breed dogs. ANIMALS: Five 7-month-old mixed breed dogs from 2 related litters were presented for evaluation of a 2-month history of acral mutilation and progressive pelvic limb gait abnormalities. METHODS: Complete physical, neurological, electrodiagnostic, and histopathological evaluations were performed. Whole genome sequencing of 2 affected dogs (1 from each litter) was used to identify variants that were homozygous or heterozygous in both cases, but wild type in 217 control genomes of 100 breeds. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess protein expression. RESULTS: Complete physical, neurological, electrodiagnostic, and histopathological evaluations confirmed a disorder affecting sensory and autonomic nerves. Whole genome sequencing identified a missense variant in the RETREG1 (reticulophagy regulator 1) gene (c.656C &gt; T, p.P219L). All affected dogs were homozygous for the variant, which was not detected in 1193 dogs from different breeds. Immunohistochemistry showed no expression of RETREG1 in the cerebellum of affected dogs. One of the affected dogs lived for 5 years and showed gradual progression of the clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We confirmed the diagnosis of HSAN in a family of mixed breed dogs and identified a novel and possibly pathogenic RETREG1 variant. Affected dogs experienced gradual deterioration over several years.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meurs, K M</author><author>Adin, D</author><author>O'Donnell, K</author><author>Keene, B W</author><author>Atkins, C E</author><author>DeFrancesco, T</author><author>Tou, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myxomatous mitral valve disease in the miniature poodle: A retrospective study.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>94-97</pages><volume>244</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>North Carolina</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30825902</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.12.019</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cardiovascular disease  in the dog. The natural history of the disease is wide ranging and includes patients without clinical signs as well as those with significant clinical consequences from cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension and/or congestive heart failure. The factors that determine which dogs remain asymptomatic and which develop clinical disease are not known. Disease characteristics could be breed or family related; some breeds of dogs, particularly the Cavalier King Charles spaniels, develop MMVD at an early age. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively characterize MMVD in the miniature poodle, a commonly affected breed in which MMVD has not been well characterized. Thirty-two miniature poodles met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 11±three years. Clinical signs included exercise intolerance, syncope and coughing. Eighteen dogs were classified as ACVIM Stage B1, 12 as stage B2, and two as stage C. Mean vertebral heart scale (VHS) was 10.2 (±standard deviation of 0.9); 15 of 28 dogs had a VHS &lt;10.3. One dog had radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure. Mean diastolic left ventricle dimension normalized to body weight was 1.6 (±0.4) and mean systolic was 0.8 (±0.3). Mitral valve prolapse was subjectively classified as mild or moderate in 19 dogs and severe in two. In the miniature poodles reported here, MMVD appears to be a fairly late onset disease and often is a mild phenotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuchtey, John</author><author>Kunkel, Jessica</author><author>Esson, Douglas</author><author>Sapienza, John S</author><author>Ward, Daniel A</author><author>Plummer, Caryn E</author><author>Gelatt, Kirk N</author><author>Kuchtey, Rachel W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Screening ADAMTS10 in dog populations supports Gly661Arg as the glaucoma-causing  variant in beagles.</title><secondary-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</full-title></periodical><pages>1881-1886</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>ADAM Proteins</keyword><keyword>ADAMTS Proteins</keyword><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>DNA Mutational Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Open-Angle</keyword><keyword>Intraocular Pressure</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23422823</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.12-10796</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: Previously, we mapped the disease locus in the beagle model of autosomal  recessive primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) to a 4-Mb interval on chromosome 20, and identified a Gly661Arg variant in ADAMTS10 as the candidate disease-causing variant. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the Gly661Arg variant of ADAMTS10 causes glaucoma by genotyping dogs of various breeds affected and unaffected by primary glaucoma. METHODS: Dogs of various breeds, affected or unaffected with primary glaucoma, were genotyped for the Gly661Arg variant of ADAMTS10, as well as 7 other nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in other genes in the beagle POAG locus that segregate with disease. Alternate allele frequencies were calculated with 95% confidence intervals and comparisons made to expected allele frequency relative to disease prevalence or between cases and controls. RESULTS: For the nonsynonymous SNPs other than the ADAMTS10 variant, control dogs were identified that were homozygous for the alternative alleles, ruling out those variants as causative. None of the nonsynonymous SNPs were found associated with primary glaucoma in American cocker spaniels. The Gly661Arg variant of ADAMTS10 was the only variant with minor allele frequency consistent with the prevalence of primary glaucoma in the general beagle population. The only dog found homozygous for the Gly661Arg variant of ADAMTS10 was an affected beagle, unrelated to the POAG colony. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the Gly661Arg mutation of ADAMTS10 as the likely cause of POAG in beagles.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marino, Dominic J</author><author>Loughin, Catherine A</author><author>Dewey, Curtis W</author><author>Marino, Leonard J</author><author>Sackman, Joseph J</author><author>Lesser, Martin L</author><author>Akerman, Meredith B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphometric features of the craniocervical junction region in dogs with  suspected Chiari-like malformation determined by combined use of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>105-111</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Occipital Joint</keyword><keyword>Cerebrum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medulla Oblongata</keyword><keyword>Neck</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22204295</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.73.1.105</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To objectively describe morphometric features of the craniocervical  junction region of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and non-CKCS dogs with suspected Chiari-like malformation (CLM) and identify associations between these features and the presence of other malformations in this region. ANIMALS: 216 CKCSs and 58 non-CKCS dogs. PROCEDURES: Magnetic resonance and computed tomographic images of the head and craniocervical junction region of patients evaluated because of suspected CLM were assessed for cerebellar compression (CC), ventral spinal cord compression at the C1-C2 articulation (medullary kinking), and dorsal spinal cord compression at the C1-C2 articulation (dorsal compression). A compression index was calculated for each of these 3 locations in each dog. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether breed (CKCS vs non-CKCS) and compression index values were associated with the presence of other craniocervical junction abnormalities. RESULTS: All 274 dogs had CC; medullary kinking was identified in 187 (68.2%) and dorsal compression was identified in 104 (38.0%). Atlantooccipital overlapping (AOO) was identified in 76 (27.7%) dogs. Breed of dog (CKCS vs non-CKCS) and value of CC index were the only significant predictors of AOO. The CKCSs had an almost 5-fold decrease in risk of AOO, compared with the non-CKCS dogs, and the risk of AOO nearly doubled for every 10% increase in CC index. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The anatomic abnormality responsible for CC was AOO in a substantial percentage of dogs suspected to have CLM. The CC index value may be used to help differentiate subtypes of craniocervical junction abnormalities in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zois, Nora E</author><author>Moesgaard, Sophia G</author><author>Kjelgaard-Hansen, Mads</author><author>Rasmussen, Caroline E</author><author>Falk, Torkel</author><author>Fossing, Christine</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulating cytokine concentrations in dogs with different degrees of myxomatous  mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>106-111</pages><volume>192</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Denmark</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Heart Ventricles</keyword><keyword>Immunoassay</keyword><keyword>Least-Squares Analysis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Function</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21696985</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.05.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cytokines have been associated with the progression of congestive heart failure  (CHF) in humans and may be implicated in the pathophysiology of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs. The aim of this study was to determine the serum concentrations of cytokines in dogs with MMVD. The study included 16 Cairn terriers with no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 41 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with different degrees of MR and 11 dogs of different breeds with CHF due to MMVD. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, interferon-γ-induced protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured using a canine-specific multiplex immunoassay. CHF dogs had significantly higher MCP-1 concentrations than dogs with no or minimal MR. Among the CKCS, IL-2 and IL-7 decreased with increasing left atrial size and IL-7 also decreased with increasing MR. IL-8 decreased with increasing left ventricular end-systolic internal dimensions. MCP-1 was increased in CHF dogs compared to healthy control dogs and IL-2, IL-7 and IL-8 decreased with increasing indices of disease severity. The results suggest a role for these cytokines in canine MMVD and CHF.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McAlees, T J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia in 110 dogs in Victoria, Australia.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>25-28</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Victoria</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20148823</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2009.00537.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the survival and prognostic indicators (i.e. breed  predilection, season, blood transfusion, and the prevalence of autoagglutination) of dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) in Victoria, Australia. DESIGN: Retrospective study of 110 diagnosed with primary IMHA at the University of Melbourne Veterinary Clinic and Hospital. RESULTS: In total, 80 of the dogs (72.7%) were discharged from hospital and 48 of 65 (73.8%) dogs available for follow-up were known to be alive at 1 year, giving an overall 1-year survival of 48 (50.5%) of 95 dogs for which survival data were available. Regarding breed, 80 (18.2%) of the 110 dogs were Maltese-breed dogs compared with 81 (7.4%) of 1100 control dogs (P &lt; 0.001). Springer Spaniels (P = 0.02), Hungarian Vizslas (P = 0.02) and Airedale Terriers (P &lt; 0.001) were also over-represented compared with the control sample. There was no evidence of an association between the occurrence of IMHA in dogs and season in this study. Receiving one or more blood transfusions did not affect survival to the time of discharge from hospital. On initial blood smear examination, 57 (51.8%) of the 110 dogs had spontaneous autoagglutination and its presence was associated with decreased survival to discharge from hospital (P = 0.03). Packed cell volume, white cell count, platelet count and serum total bilirubin on admission had no effect on survival to the time of discharge from hospital or 1 year later. CONCLUSION: Dogs with IMHA have a guarded prognosis as only half are still alive 1 year after the acute event.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huenerfauth, Enrice I</author><author>Bien, Christian G</author><author>Bien, Corinna</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author><author>Meyerhoff, Nina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Case Report: Anti-GABA (A) Receptor Encephalitis in a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>886711</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35812851</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2022.886711</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors detected in cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) and serum are increasingly recognized in people with human autoimmune encephalitis causing severe neurological deficits, such as seizures and behavioral abnormalities. This case report describes the first encephalitis associated with antibodies against the γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA(A)R) in a dog. A young male intact Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was presented with recent onset of initial multiple generalized tonic-clonic seizures progressing into a status epilepticus. Interictally, he showed alternating stupor and hyperexcitability, ataxia, pleurothotonus and circling behavior to the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed breed-specific anatomical abnormalities. Standard CSF analysis was unremarkable. Despite treatment with multiple antiseizure medications (ASMs) seizures and behavior abnormalities sustained. Immunotherapy with dexamethasone was started on the fifth day after disease manifestation. This led to rapid improvement of clinical signs. An extensive antibody search in CSF and serum demonstrated a neuropil staining pattern on a tissue-based assay compatible with GABA(A)R antibodies. The diagnosis was confirmed by binding of serum and CSF antibodies to GABA(A)R transfected Human Embryonic Kidney cells. The serum titer was 1:320, the CSF titer 1:2. At the control visit 4.5 weeks after start of immunotherapy, the dog was clinically normal. The GABA(A)R antibody titer in serum had strongly decreased. The antibodies were no longer detectable in CSF. Based on clinical presentation and testing for GABA(A)R binding antibodies, this describes the first veterinary patient with an anti-GABA(A)R encephalitis with a good outcome following ASM and corticosteroid treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wagner, Franziska</author><author>Ruf, Irina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>&quot;Forever young&quot;-Postnatal growth inhibition of the turbinal skeleton in  brachycephalic dog breeds (Canis lupus familiaris).</title><secondary-title>Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)</full-title></periodical><pages>154-189</pages><volume>304</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Nasal Cavity</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32462796</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ar.24422</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In short snouted (brachycephalic) dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), several genetic  mutations cause postnatal growth inhibition of the viscerocranium. Thus, for example, the pug keeps a snub nose like that observed in neonate dogs in general. However, little is known how far intranasal structures like the turbinal skeleton are also affected. In the present study, we provide the first detailed morphological and morphometric analyses on the turbinal skeleton of pug, Japanese chin, pekingese, King Charles spaniel, and Cavalier. In order to elucidate how a shortened snout affects turbinal shape, size, and density, our sample covers different degrees of brachycephaly. Macerated skulls of 1 juvenile and 17 adult individuals were investigated by μCT and virtual 3D reconstructions. In addition, histological serial sections of two prenatal and one neonate whippet were taken into account. All investigated postnatal stages show three frontoturbinals and three ethmoturbinals similar to longer snouted breeds, whereas the number of interturbinals is reduced. The shape of the entire turbinal skeleton simplifies with decreasing snout length, that is, within a minimized nasal cavity the turbinals decrease proportionally in surface area and surface density due to a looser arrangement. We interpret these apparent reductions as a result of spatial constraint which affects postnatal appositional bone growth and the position of the turbinals inside the nasal cavity. The turbinal skeleton of brachycephalic dogs arrests at an early ontogenetic stage, corresponding with previous studies on the dermal bones. Hence, we assume an association between the growth of intranasal structures and facial elongation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, Rachel L</author><author>Reilly, Christopher M</author><author>Moore, Phillip A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surgical excision of iridociliary tumors using a postero-anterior  cyclo-iridectomy and thermocautery in two dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>579-587</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoma</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ciliary Body</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Iridectomy</keyword><keyword>Iris Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32237209</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12755</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To report the surgical excision of an iridociliary adenoma and iridal  melanocytoma using a postero-anterior cyclo-iridectomy in two dogs. PROCEDURE: A 7 year old neutered male English springer spaniel (case 1) and a 7 year old neutered male Labrador mix (case 2) were presented for evaluation of an intrairidal mass OS. RESULTS: Complete ophthalmic examination revealed a large, dorsonasal, well-demarcated, intrairidal mass OS. A tan to pink intrairidal mass extending into the iridocorneal angle (case 1) and a pigmented intrairidal mass (case 2) were present. B-mode ultrasonography showed a focal, soft tissue, homogenous mass within the uvea adjacent to and contacting the lens. Neither pars plana involvement nor vitreal extension was present. A postero-anterior cyclo-iridectomy was performed through a polyhedral scleral flap. Thermocautery was used to complete the cyclo-iridectomy (case 1) and partial iridectomy (case 2) to excise the mass en bloc. Histopathology revealed a completely excised iridociliary adenoma (case 1) and iris melanocytoma (case 2). The surgery sites healed without complication. Mild uveitis (cases 1 and 2), scant vitreal hemorrhage (case 1), and mild hyphema (case 2) were present three days postoperatively but had resolved ten days postoperatively. The patients remain visual twenty-two months (case 1) and seven months (case 2) postoperatively with a normal intraocular examination other than an iridal defect and mild dorsonasal lens capsular opacities. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical approach described in these cases is utilized in physician-based medicine. This approach and the use of thermocautery provide a viable surgical option for excision of large iridociliary tumors in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Fajnerová, Iveta</author><author>Dvořáček, Boris</author><author>Bourama, Eva</author><author>Stamou, Ilektra</author><author>Šulcová, Kateřina</author><author>Motýl, Jiří</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author><author>Rodriguez, Mabel</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Theoretical Modeling of Cognitive Dysfunction in Schizophrenia by Means of Errors  and Corresponding Brain Networks.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>1027</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30026711</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01027</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The current evidence of cognitive disturbances and brain alterations in  schizophrenia does not provide the plausible explanation of the underlying mechanisms. Neuropsychological studies outlined the cognitive profile of patients with schizophrenia, that embodied the substantial disturbances in perceptual and motor processes, spatial functions, verbal and non-verbal memory, processing speed and executive functioning. Standardized scoring in the majority of the neurocognitive tests renders the index scores or the achievement indicating the severity of the cognitive impairment rather than the actual performance by means of errors. At the same time, the quantitative evaluation may lead to the situation when two patients with the same index score of the particular cognitive test, demonstrate qualitatively different performances. This may support the view why test paradigms that habitually incorporate different cognitive variables associate weakly, reflecting an ambiguity in the interpretation of noted cognitive constructs. With minor exceptions, cognitive functions are not attributed to the localized activity but eventuate from the coordinated activity in the generally dispersed brain networks. Functional neuroimaging has progressively explored the connectivity in the brain networks in the absence of the specific task and during the task processing. The spatio-temporal fluctuations of the activity of the brain areas detected in the resting state and being highly reproducible in numerous studies, resemble the activation and communication patterns during the task performance. Relatedly, the activation in the specific brain regions oftentimes is attributed to a number of cognitive processes. Given the complex organization of the cognitive functions, it becomes crucial to designate the roles of the brain networks in relation to the specific cognitive functions. One possible approach is to identify the commonalities of the deficits across the number of cognitive tests or, common errors in the various tests and identify their common &quot;denominators&quot; in the brain networks. The qualitative characterization of cognitive performance might be beneficial in addressing diffuse cognitive alterations presumably caused by the dysconnectivity of the distributed brain networks. Therefore, in the review, we use this approach in the description of standardized tests in the scope of potential errors in patients with schizophrenia with a subsequent reference to the brain networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mikolas, P</author><author>Melicher, T</author><author>Skoch, A</author><author>Matejka, M</author><author>Slovakova, A</author><author>Bakstein, E</author><author>Hajek, T</author><author>Spaniel, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Connectivity of the anterior insula differentiates participants with  first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders from controls: a machine-learning study.</title><secondary-title>Psychological medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychological medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2695-2704</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Connectome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Support Vector Machine</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27451917</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0033291716000878</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of schizophrenia could improve the outcomes and limit  the negative effects of untreated illness. Although participants with schizophrenia show aberrant functional connectivity in brain networks, these between-group differences have a limited diagnostic utility. Novel methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses, such as machine learning (ML), may help bring neuroimaging from the bench to the bedside. Here, we used ML to differentiate participants with a first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (FES) from healthy controls based on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). METHOD: We acquired resting-state functional MRI data from 63 patients with FES who were individually matched by age and sex to 63 healthy controls. We applied linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) to rsFC within the default mode network, the salience network and the central executive network. RESULTS: The SVM applied to the rsFC within the salience network distinguished the FES from the control participants with an accuracy of 73.0% (p = 0.001), specificity of 71.4% and sensitivity of 74.6%. The classification accuracy was not significantly affected by medication dose, or by the presence of psychotic symptoms. The functional connectivity within the default mode or the central executive networks did not yield classification accuracies above chance level. CONCLUSIONS: Seed-based functional connectivity maps can be utilized for diagnostic classification, even early in the course of schizophrenia. The classification was probably based on trait rather than state markers, as symptoms or medications were not significantly associated with classification accuracy. Our results support the role of the anterior insula/salience network in the pathophysiology of FES.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borge, Kaja Sverdrup</author><author>Melin, Malin</author><author>Rivera, Patricio</author><author>Thoresen, Stein Istre</author><author>Webster, Matthew Thomas</author><author>von Euler, Henrik</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin</author><author>Lingaas, Frode</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The ESR1 gene is associated with risk for canine mammary tumours.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>69</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Estrogen Receptor alpha</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Association Studies</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23574728</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1746-6148-9-69</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The limited within-breed genetic heterogeneity and an enrichment of  disease-predisposing alleles have made the dog a very suitable model for the identification of genes associated with risk for specific diseases. Canine mammary cancer is an example of such a disease. However, the underlying inherited risk factors for canine mammary tumours (CMTs) are still largely unknown. In this study, 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ten human cancer-associated genes were genotyped in two different datasets in order to identify genes/alleles associated with the development of CMTs. The first dataset consisted of English Springer Spaniel (ESS) CMT cases and controls. ESS is a dog breed known to be at increased risk of developing CMTs. In the second dataset, dogs from breeds known to have a high frequency of CMTs were compared to dogs from breeds with a lower occurrence of these tumours. RESULTS: We found significant associations to CMT for SNPs and haplotypes in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene in the ESS material (best PBonf = 0.021). A large number of SNPs, among them several SNPs in ESR1, showed significantly different allele frequencies between the high and low risk breed groups (best PBonf = 8.8E-32, best PBPerm = 0.076). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of CMT-associated SNPs in ESR1 in two independent datasets suggests that this gene might be involved in CMT development. These findings also support that CMT may serve as a good model for human breast cancer research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Groppetti, D</author><author>Genualdo, V</author><author>Bosi, G</author><author>Pecile, A</author><author>Iannuzzi, A</author><author>Perucatti, A</author><author>De Lorenzi, L</author><author>Parma, P</author><author>Arrighi, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>XX SRY-negative true hermaphrodism in two dogs: clinical, morphological, genetic  and cytogenetic studies.</title><secondary-title>Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology,  embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology,  embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation</full-title></periodical><pages>135-142</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genitalia</keyword><keyword>Gonads</keyword><keyword>Karyotype</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ovotesticular Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21921586</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000331274</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This work aimed at giving a deeper insight into peculiar cases of intersexuality  occurring in dogs and known as XX true hermaphrodism due to the existence of both testicular and ovarian tissue in one or both gonads in the presence of an XX chromosome constitution. Clinical, histological and genetic approaches were used in the study of an 8-month-old Cocker Spaniel dog and a 3-year-old mixed-breed Pitbull, both showing a female phenotype, clitoromegaly and male behavior. A normal female karyotype (2n = 78,XX) was noticed, and polymerase chain reaction failed to detect SRY in genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes of both dogs. The reproductive tract was removed by standard ovariohysterectomy and processed for histology. Thereafter, a normal female phenotype was reconstructed by vaginoplasty. Histological examination revealed bilateral ovotestis in both cases: the gonads showed immature testicular parenchyma containing seminiferous tubules, Sertoli and Leydig cells, but no signs of spermatogenesis, together with differently developed ovarian follicles containing oocytes. In the ovotestes, steroidogenesis was detected by P450c17-immunoreactivity in Leydig cells as well as in theca cells, whereas no MIS-immunoreactivity was shown by the Sertoli cells. Genital tracts of Wolffian and Müllerian origin co-existed in both subjects. Both dogs belong to the very rare cases in which testicular tissue develops in the absence of the key gene, SRY. Up to date very few genetic events have been associated with this abnormal sexual differentiation: SOX9 over-expression and RSPO1 mutation. Nevertheless, neither of them has been found in these dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jin-Kyu</author><author>Hong, Il-Hwa</author><author>Ki, Mi-Ran</author><author>Hong, Kyung-Sook</author><author>Ji, Ae-Ri</author><author>Do, Sun-Hee</author><author>Jeong, Kyu-Shik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple perianal infundibular follicular cysts in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>303-306</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Gland Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Follicular Cyst</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms, Multiple Primary</keyword><keyword>Perianal Glands</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20136788</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-3164.2009.00794.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This case report describes a 7-year-old male cocker spaniel dog with multiple  perianal infundibular follicular cysts. Clinically the dog had moderate anal sacculitis, peri-anal pruritus causing it to 'scoot' and lick the area. On examination of the perianal area, there were over 100 firm, well circumscribed papules, ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in diameter with a central pore, and were found in the perianal region. Alopecia was present in the perianal region. The skin tissue in the perianal region resected surgically was submitted for histological examination. Microscopically, the tissue revealed multiple dilated cysts filled with keratins and the papules corresponded to infundibular follicular cysts. The affected dog showed moderate anal sacculitis. Anal sacculitis commonly causes repeated scooting or licking the area around the anus. Therefore, the multiple follicular cysts in the present case appear to be primarily a sequela to chronic external trauma to the perianal area, probably in response to anal sacculitis. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present report is the first documented case of multiple perianal infundibular follicular cysts in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arndt, J W</author><author>Reynolds, C A</author><author>Singletary, G E</author><author>Connolly, J M</author><author>Levy, R J</author><author>Oyama, M A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serum serotonin concentrations in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1208-1213</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Serotonin</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19709352</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0378.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Increased serotonin (5HT) signaling has been implicated in valvular  disease of humans and animals, including canine degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD). High circulating 5HT concentration is a potential source of increased signaling, and serum 5HT concentrations have not been previously reported in dogs with DMVD. HYPOTHESIS: Dogs with DMVD and small breed dogs predisposed to DMVD have higher serum 5HT concentrations than large breed controls. ANIMALS: Fifty dogs affected with DMVD, 34 dogs predisposed to DMVD but without cardiac murmur or echocardiographic evidence of DMVD, and 36 healthy large breed control dogs. METHODS: Prospective analysis. Serum 5HT concentration was measured by an ELISA test. RESULTS: Median serum 5HT concentration was significantly higher in dogs with DMVD and in dogs predisposed to DMVD as compared with controls (DMVD, 765.5 ng/mL [interquartile range, 561.3-944.4]; predisposed, 774.9 ng/mL [528.3-1,026]; control, 509.8 ng/mL [320.8-708.8]; P= .0001). Subgroup analysis of predisposed dogs indicated significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs than in other breeds (CKCS, 855.0 ng/mL [635.8-1,088]; non-CKCS, 554.2 ng/mL [380.6-648.4]; P= .0023). Age, platelet count, and platelet morphology were not correlated with 5HT concentration in any group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Dogs with DMVD had significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations when compared with large breed control dogs. Healthy CKCS dogs had significantly higher serum 5HT concentrations than other healthy dogs predisposed to DMVD. Additional investigation into a possible role of 5HT in the pathogenesis of DMVD is warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Busse, Claudia</author><author>Dennis, Ruth</author><author>Platt, Simon R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suspected sphenoid bone osteomyelitis causing visual impairment in two dogs and  one cat.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>71-77</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Anti-Inflammatory Agents</keyword><keyword>Blindness</keyword><keyword>Carbazoles</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Osteomyelitis</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Sphenoid Bone</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19261160</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2008.00678.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  characteristics of sphenoid bone osteomyelitis. PROCEDURES: Two dogs (English Springer Spaniel--ESS, Golden Retriever--GR) and one cat (Domestic Long Haired) were presented with a 2-14-day history of visual deficits and reduced pupillary light reflexes. Investigations included physical, ophthalmologic and neurological examination as well as hematology, serum biochemistry, MRI of the head and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. RESULTS: MRI changes included thickening of the sphenoid bone and a loss of normal bone marrow signal on T1W MRI. Enhancement of the sphenoid bones, ventral meninges and ventral surface of the brain was present using paramagnetic contrast medium. CSF analysis was abnormal in the two dogs with increased cellularity, neutrophilic pleocytosis, intracellular bacteria and increased total protein in one, and with lymphocytic pleocytosis in another. CSF analysis was normal in the cat. An underlying cause for the osteomyelitis could not be identified. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3-6 weeks combined with anti-inflammatory medications proved effective. Full clinical recovery occurred with no relapse during the follow up time of 7 (ESS) and 4 (Domestic Long Haired) years. The GR relapsed 10 months after treatment and recovered following a second 3-week course of broad-spectrum antibiotics with no relapse during the following 3 years. CONCLUSION: Visual pathway deficits in dogs and cats may be due to sphenoid bone osteomyelitis. MRI and CSF analysis can assist diagnosing this potentially treatable condition. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of sphenoid bone osteomyelitis in these species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spector, Daniel I</author><author>Keating, John H</author><author>Boudrieau, Randy J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immediate mandibular reconstruction of a 5 cm defect using rhBMP-2 after partial  mandibulectomy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>752-759</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2</keyword><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins</keyword><keyword>Bone Plates</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mandible</keyword><keyword>Mandibular Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Odontoma</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor beta</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>18067615</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00332.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To report treatment of a complex odontoma of the mandible by partial  mandibulectomy and immediate surgical reconstruction using bridging plate fixation with a synthetic graft. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical case report. ANIMALS: A 4-year-old male castrated cocker spaniel. METHODS: Immediate reconstruction of the left mandible (5 cm gap) was performed after complete excision of a complex odontoma. Locking plate fixation was applied immediately before complete excision of the mass. Fixation was removed, then after partial mandibulectomy, including all abnormal tissue, restored to achieve occlusion. The resulting mandibular defect was filled with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) delivered in an absorbable collagen sponge containing hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate granules (compression resistant matrix [CRM]). RESULTS: New bone growth was evident radiographically and on palpation at 3 months. Bony remodeling was evident during follow-up examinations up to 26 months. Bone collected by biopsy at the graft site at 7 months had robust new bone formation and evidence of continued remodeling. Only minor complications (repeated intraoral plate exposure) were encountered postoperatively and were easily resolved. CONCLUSIONS: An osteoinductive factor (rhBMP-2/CRM) was successfully used as a graft substitute in immediate reconstruction of a large mandibular defect. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immediate reconstruction of large mandibular defects with osteoinductive materials as a graft substitute may be a viable alternative to partial mandibular resection or radiation therapy for benign odontogenic tumors in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Gaag, I</author><author>Happé, R P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The histological appearance of peroral small intestinal biopsies in clinically  healthy dogs and dogs with chronic diarrhea.</title><secondary-title>Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

Three and a half percent of the suction biopsies and 22.6 percent of the forceps biopsies were unsuitable for examination, making a diagnosis impossible in 9 dogs, and in 0.4 percent antral mucosa was present. Biopsies could be obtained from the proximal one third of the small intestine. The normal histology, including mean villous length, its standard deviation and its range is described in the 17 control dogs. A classification of enteritis in dogs is given. Villous atrophy without enteritis was found in 55 dogs with chronic diarrhea; 51 dogs had moderate and four severe villous atrophy. Villous atrophy combined with enteritis was found in 93 dogs, 57 of which had lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, 14 had eosinophilic enteritis, six catarrhal, four ulcerative, 11 a combination of lymphocytic-plasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis and one dog had a combination of lymphocytic-plasmacytic and catarrhal enteritis. Enteritis without villous atrophy was found in 50 dogs: 39 had lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, four eosinophilic, two catarrhal, one purulent (microabscesses), three a combination of lymphocytic-plasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis and one dog had focal necrosis. Twelve dogs showed a lymphosarcoma and in eight other dogs a differential diagnosis of lymphosarcoma and/or enteritis was made. One carcinoma was found. Other findings were hemorrhages, oedema, erosions, muscular hypertrophy in the villi, an increased or decreased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, an increased or decreased number of goblet cells, lymphangiectasia, crypt cysts, crypt abscesses and gastric metaplasia. Some breeds, such as the German Shepherd dog, Bouvier des Flandres, Spaniel, Collie, Great Dane and Retriever appear to be more susceptible than other breeds for villous atrophy and enteritis. A slight prevalence of the German Shepherd dog, Doberman Pinscher and Rottweiler was also observed for eosinophilic enteritis. Mild villous atrophy is mostly found in dogs aged 0-4 years, whereas severe villous atrophy is found in dogs older than 4 years. Further breed, age or sex predisposition could not be found. The method appears especially useful for diffuse mucosal lesions of the proximal small intestine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez, Mabel</author><author>Knížková, Karolína</author><author>Keřková, Barbora</author><author>Siroňová, Aneta</author><author>Šustová, Petra</author><author>Jonáš, Juraj</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The relationships between cognitive reserve, cognitive functioning and quality of  life in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</title><secondary-title>Psychiatry research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychiatry research</full-title></periodical><pages>114479</pages><volume>310</volume><keywords><keyword>Cognition</keyword><keyword>Cognitive Reserve</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Memory, Short-Term</keyword><keyword>Neuropsychological Tests</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35231876</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114479</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cognitive reserve (CR) has been conceptualized as an individual's ability to  optimize or maximize performance through differential recruitment of brain networks. As such, CR may contribute to the heterogeneity of cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. This study aimed to assess the relationships between CR, cognition and quality of life in first-episode (FES) patients. A total of 137 patients with either ICD-10 schizophrenia or &quot;acute and transient psychotic disorders&quot; diagnosis, and 62 healthy controls had completed a comprehensive assessment of six cognitive domains: speed of processing, attention, working memory/flexibility, verbal memory, visual memory, and abstraction/executive functioning. CR was calculated from the participants' education, premorbid IQ, and socioeconomic status. The results suggested that in patients, CR was positively related to cognitive performance in all domains, explaining 42.6% of the variance observed in cognition overall. Effects of CR in the control group were limited to three domains: speed of processing, abstraction/executive function and working memory/flexibility. These results suggest that CR largely contributes to cognitive variations present in FES patients. In addition, CR was negatively related to the social construct of patients' quality of life, and positively to symptom severity and general functioning.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schneider, Jakub</author><author>Bakštein, Eduard</author><author>Kolenič, Marian</author><author>Vostatek, Pavel</author><author>Correll, Christoph U</author><author>Novák, Daniel</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Motor activity patterns can distinguish between interepisode bipolar disorder  patients and healthy controls.</title><secondary-title>CNS spectrums</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CNS spectrums</full-title></periodical><pages>82-92</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Actigraphy</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Bipolar Disorder</keyword><keyword>Circadian Rhythm</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Motor Activity</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>32883376</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S1092852920001777</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is linked to circadian rhythm disruptions  resulting in aberrant motor activity patterns. We aimed to explore whether motor activity alone, as assessed by longitudinal actigraphy, can be used to classify accurately BD patients and healthy controls (HCs) into their respective groups. METHODS: Ninety-day actigraphy records from 25 interepisode BD patients (ie, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) &lt; 15) and 25 sex- and age-matched HCs were used in order to identify latent actigraphic biomarkers capable of discriminating between BD patients and HCs. Mean values and time variations of a set of standard actigraphy features were analyzed and further validated using the random forest classifier. RESULTS: Using all actigraphy features, this method correctly assigned 88% (sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 91%) of BD patients and HCs to their respective group. The classification success may be confounded by differences in employment between BD patients and HCs. When motor activity features resistant to the employment status were used (the strongest feature being time variation of intradaily variability, Cohen's d = 1.33), 79% of the subjects (sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 81%) were correctly classified. CONCLUSION: A machine-learning actigraphy-based model was capable of distinguishing between interepisode BD patients and HCs solely on the basis of motor activity. The classification remained valid even when features influenced by employment status were omitted. The findings suggest that temporal variability of actigraphic parameters may provide discriminative power for differentiating between BD patients and HCs while being less affected by employment status.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guerin, Vincent J</author><author>'t Hooft, Krista W Visser</author><author>L'Eplattenier, Henry F</author><author>Petite, Audrey F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transitional cell carcinoma involving the ductus deferens in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>446-449</pages><volume>240</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Transitional Cell</keyword><keyword>Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Euthanasia, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Meloxicam</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Testicular Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Thiazines</keyword><keyword>Thiazoles</keyword><keyword>Vas Deferens</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22309017</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.240.4.446</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 12-year-old neutered male Springer Spaniel was referred with  a 1-year history of recurring urinary tract infections. Repeated treatment with appropriate antimicrobials selected on the basis of bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility results would result in clinical improvement, but recurrence of clinical signs was observed within days after discontinuation of treatment. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Ultrasound examination revealed a tubular, fluid-filled structure dorsal to the bladder that extended from the midlevel of the bladder to the cranial pole of the prostate. Mineralized foci within a heterogeneous prostatic parenchyma were also noted. Dilation of the right ductus deferens (DD) was observed during exploratory laparotomy. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Both DD were surgically removed, and the prostate was biopsied. The histopathological diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma involving the right DD and the prostate. The dog was treated with meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg [0.05 mg/lb], p.o., q 24 h) for 9 months after diagnosis before being euthanized. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because the normal DD is rarely visualized during abdominal ultrasonography in dogs, identification of a tubular, fluid-filled structure dorsal to the bladder may indicate an abnormal DD. Transitional cell carcinoma of the DD should be included in the differential diagnoses of affected patients examined for clinical signs involving the urinary tract.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wess, Gerhard</author><author>Thomas, William P</author><author>Berger, Denise M</author><author>Kittleson, Mark D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applications, complications, and outcomes of transvenous pacemaker implantation  in 105 dogs (1997-2002).</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>877-884</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Block</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pacemaker, Artificial</keyword><keyword>Sick Sinus Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16955812</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2006)20[877:acaoot]2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We reviewed the indications for age and breeds of dogs who received transvenous  endocardial artificial pacemaker (AP) implantation (n = 105) and complications and survival thereafter at a single institution over a 6-year period. A third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (59%) and sick sinus syndrome (SSS; 27%) were the most common indications, along with a high-grade second-degree AV block (9%) and atrial standstill (5%). The most common breeds identified were Labrador Retriever (n = 16; 11 with a third-degree AV block), American Cocker Spaniel (n = 14; 10 with SSS), and Miniature Schnauzer (n = 13; all with SSS). Common presenting complaints were syncope (n = 66) and exercise intolerance or lethargy (n = 25). Half of the dogs (n = 52) had a history of acute onset of clinical signs (&lt;2 weeks). Mean survival time for the 60 dogs who died during the study period was 2.2 years (range, 0.1-5.8 years). Major complications occurred in 13% of dogs and included lead displacement (n = 7), sensing problems that led to syncope (n = 3), infection at the pacemaker site (n = 1), bleeding (n = 1), and ventricular fibrillation during implantation (n = 1; successfully defibrillated). Minor complications occurred in 11 dogs (11%). The success rate of transvenous AP implantation was comparatively high (all dogs survived the first 48 hours), and the complication rate was comparatively low when compared with a previous multicenter study, most likely because of how commonly the procedure was performed and supervisory experience.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jezierski, Tadeusz</author><author>Adamkiewicz, Ewa</author><author>Walczak, Marta</author><author>Sobczyńska, Magdalena</author><author>Górecka-Bruzda, Aleksandra</author><author>Ensminger, John</author><author>Papet, Eugene</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of drug detection by fully-trained police dogs varies by breed, training  level, type of drug and search environment.</title><secondary-title>Forensic science international</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forensic science international</full-title></periodical><pages>112-118</pages><volume>237</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Illicit Drugs</keyword><keyword>Odorants</keyword><keyword>Police</keyword><keyword>Smell</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24631776</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.01.013</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Some recent publications claim that the effectiveness of police canine drug  detection is uncertain and likely minimal, and that the deterrent effect of dogs on drug users is low. It is also claimed that more scientific evidence is needed to demonstrate to what extent dogs actually detect drugs. The aim of this research was to assess experimentally, but in actual training and testing environments used by the Polish police, how effective dogs trained by the police were at illicit substance detection depending on factors such as type of drug, dog breed, dog experience with the searching site, and drug odor residuals. 68 Labrador retrievers, 61 German shepherds, 25 Terriers and 10 English Cocker Spaniels, of both sexes in each breed, were used. Altogether 1219 experimental searching tests were conducted. On average, hidden drug samples were indicated by dogs after 64s searching time, with 87.7% indications being correct and 5.3% being false. In 7.0% of trials dogs failed to find the drug sample within 10min. The ranking of drugs from the easiest to the most difficult to detect was: marijuana, hashish, amphetamine, cocaine, heroin. German shepherds were superior to other breeds in giving correct indications while Terriers showed relatively poor detection performance. Dogs were equally efficient at searching in well-known vs. unknown rooms with strange (i.e., non-target novelty) odors (83.2% correct indications), but they were less accurate when searching outside or inside cars (63.5% and 57.9% correct indications respectively). During police examination trials the dogs made more false alerts, fewer correct indications and searching time was longer compared to the final stage of the training. The drug odor may persist at a site for at least 48h. Our experiments do not confirm the recent reports, based on drug users' opinions, of low drug detection efficiency. Usefulness of drug detection dogs has been demonstrated here, even if their effectiveness may not be 100%, but different factors have to be taken into consideration to assure maximum effectiveness.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bourgès-Abella, Nathalie</author><author>Geffré, Anne</author><author>Concordet, Didier</author><author>Braun, Jean-Pierre</author><author>Trumel, Catherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine reference intervals for the Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzer.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>303-315</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Erythrocyte Count</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>France</keyword><keyword>Hematologic Tests</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte Count</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>instrumentation</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21884184</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-165X.2011.00333.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The laser-based Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzer is increasingly  used in veterinary clinical pathology laboratories, and instrument-specific reference intervals for dogs are not available. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish canine hematologic reference intervals according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines using the Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzer. METHODS: Blood samples from 132 healthy purebred dogs from France, selected to represent the most prevalent canine breeds in France, were analyzed. Blood smears were scored for platelet (PLT) aggregates. Reference intervals were established using the nonparametric method. PLT and RBC counts obtained by impedance and optical methods were compared. Effects of sex and age on reference intervals were determined. RESULTS: The correlation between impedance (I) and optical (O) measurements of RBC and PLT counts was excellent (Pearson r=.99 and .98, respectively); however, there were significant differences between the 2 methods (Student's paired t-test, P&lt;.0001). Differences between sexes were not significant except for HCT, PLT-I, and PLT-O. WBC, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts decreased significantly with age (ANOVA, P&lt;.05). Median eosinophil counts were higher in Brittany Spaniels (1.87 × 10(9) /L), Rottweilers (1.41 × 10(9) /L), and German Shepherd dogs (1.38 × 10(9) /L) than in the overall population (0.9 × 10(9) /L). PLT aggregates were responsible for lower PLT counts by the impedance, but not the optical, method. CONCLUSION: Reference intervals for hematologic analytes and indices were determined under controlled preanalytical and analytical conditions for a well-characterized population of dogs according to international recommendations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Green, S L</author><author>Tolwani, R J</author><author>Varma, S</author><author>Quignon, P</author><author>Galibert, F</author><author>Cork, L C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure, chromosomal location, and analysis of the canine Cu/Zn superoxide  dismutase (SOD1) gene.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>119-124</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy, Spinal</keyword><keyword>Radiation Hybrid Mapping</keyword><keyword>Superoxide Dismutase</keyword><keyword>Superoxide Dismutase-1</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12140271</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/93.2.119</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a major cytosolic antioxidant  enzyme in eukaryotic cells, have been reported in approximately 20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) patients. Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA), a fatal inherited motor neuron disease in Brittany spaniels, shares many clinical and pathological features with human motor neuron disease, including FALS. The SOD1 coding region has been sequenced and cloned from several animal species, but not from the dog. We have mapped the chromosomal location, sequenced, and characterized the canine SOD1 gene. Extending this analysis, we have evaluated SOD1 as a candidate for HCSMA. The 462 bp SOD1 coding region in the dog encodes 153 amino acid residues and exhibits more than 83% and 79% sequence identity to other mammalian homologues at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The canine SOD1 gene maps to CFA31 close to syntenic group 13 on the radiation hybrid (RH) map in the vicinity of sodium myo/inositol transporter (SMIT) gene. The human orthologous SOD1 and SMIT genes have been localized on HSA 21q22.1 and HSA 21q21, respectively, confirming the conservation of synteny between dog syntenic group 13 and HSA 21. Direct sequencing of SOD1 cDNA from six dogs with HCSMA revealed no mutations. Northern analysis indicated no differences in steady-state levels of SOD1 mRNA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Besso, J G</author><author>Wrigley, R H</author><author>Gliatto, J M</author><author>Webster, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ultrasonographic appearance and clinical findings in 14 dogs with gallbladder  mucocele.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>261-271</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gallbladder Diseases</keyword><keyword>Liver Function Tests</keyword><keyword>Mucocele</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10850878</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2000.tb01489.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Fourteen dogs with enlarged gallbladders and immobile stellate or finely striated  bile patterns on ultrasound are described. Smaller breeds and older dogs were overrepresented, with 4/14 Cocker Spaniels. Most dogs presented for nonspecific clinical signs such as vomiting, anorexia and lethargy. Abdominal pain, icterus and hyperthermia were the most common findings on physical examination. All dogs except one had serum elevation of total bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase. All dogs were diagnosed with a gallbladder mucocele upon histologic and/or macroscopic evaluation. Ultrasonographically, mucoceles are characterized by the appearance of the stellate or finely striated bile patterns and differ from biliary sludge by the absence of gravity dependent bile movement. On ultrasound, gallbladder wall thickness and wall appearance were variable and nonspecific. The cystic or common bile duct were normal sized in 5 dogs although all 5 had evidence of biliary obstruction at surgery or necropsy. Loss of gallbladder wall integrity and/or gallbladder rupture were present in 50% of the dogs, all located in the fundus. Gallbladder wall discontinuity on ultrasound indicated rupture whereas neither bile patterns predicted the likelihood of gallbladder rupture. Pericholecystic hyperechoic fat or fluid were suggestive of but not diagnostic for a gallbladder rupture. Cholecystectomy appears to be an appropriate treatment for mucoceles, if not to treat a gallbladder rupture, at least in most dogs to prevent it since gallbladder wall necrosis was identified by histology in 9 of 10 dogs. Mucosal hyperplasia was present in all gallbladders examined histologically. Positive aerobic bacterial culture was obtained from bile in 6 of 9 dogs. Cholecystitis was diagnosed histologically in 5 dogs and 4 dogs had signs of gallbladder infection solely upon bacterial bile culture. Gallbladder infection was not present with all the mucoceles suggesting that biliary stasis and mucosal hyperplasia may be the primary factors involved in mucocele formation. Based on the results of our study, we suggest two alternate courses of action in the presence of a distended gallbladder with an immobile ultrasonographic stellate or finely striated bile pattern: a cholecystectomy when clinical or biochemical signs of hepatobiliary disease are present or a medical treatment (antibiotics and choleretics) and patient monitoring by follow-up ultrasound examinations when the patient does not have clinical or biochemical abnormalities. An aerobic bile culture should be obtained in all patients, by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspirate or at surgery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reimann, M J</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Mortensen, A</author><author>Lykkesfeldt, J</author><author>Møller, J E</author><author>Falk, T</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biopterin status in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease is associated with  disease severity and cardiovascular risk factors.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1520-1526</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biopterin</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Tobacco Smoke Pollution</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25274442</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12425</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction (ED) has been suggested to be associated with  myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an important cofactor for production of the endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Under conditions of oxidative stress, BH4 is oxidized to the biologically inactive form dihydrobiopterin (BH2). Thus, plasma concentrations of BH2 and BH4 may reflect ED and oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: To determine plasma concentrations of BH2 and BH4 in dogs with different degrees of MMVD. ANIMALS: Eighty-four privately owned dogs grouped according to ACVIM guidelines (37 healthy control dogs including 13 Beagles and 24 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [CKCSs], 33 CKCSs with MMVD of differing severity including 18 CKCSs [group B1] and 15 CKCSs [group B2], and 14 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of congestive heart failure [CHF] because of MMVD [group C]). METHODS: Dogs underwent clinical examination including echocardiography. Plasma concentrations of BH2 and BH4 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. RESULTS: Higher plasma BH4 and BH2 concentrations were found with dogs in CHF compared with all other groups (control, B1 and B2; P ≤ .001). Females had higher concentrations of BH4 and BH4/BH2 (P ≤ .0003). BH4/BH2 was found to decrease with age (P &lt; .0001). Cardiovascular risk factors in humans such as passive smoking (P ≤ .01) and increased body weight (P ≤ .009) were associated with lower BH4 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Age, sex, body weight, passive smoking, and cardiac status are associated with plasma biopterin concentration in dogs. Additional studies should clarify the clinical implications of the findings.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rasmussen, C E</author><author>Falk, T</author><author>Zois, N E</author><author>Moesgaard, S G</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Ablad, B</author><author>Nilsen, H Y</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heart rate, heart rate variability, and arrhythmias in dogs with myxomatous  mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>76-84</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography, Ambulatory</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22151356</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00842.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Autonomic modulation of heart rhythm is thought to influence the  pathophysiology of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). HYPOTHESES: (1) Holter-derived variables reflecting autonomic modulation of heart rhythm change with MMVD severity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS); (2) Holter-derived variables can identify MMVD severity in CKCS; and (3) Holter-derived variables in CKCS in congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to MMVD differ from those in dogs of other breeds in CHF. ANIMALS: Ninety privately owned dogs: 70 CKCS with variable MMVD severity and 20 non-CKCS in CHF secondary to MMVD. METHODS: Dogs were prospectively recruited and divided into 5 MMVD severity groups based on history, breed, and physical and echocardiographic examination findings. Holter-derived variables included heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR), and arrhythmia evaluated from 24-hour Holter recordings. RESULTS: In CKCS, 18 of 26 HRV (all P &lt; .0002) and 3 of 9 arrhythmia (all P &lt; .0004) variables decreased with increasing MMVD, whereas minimum and mean HR (all P &lt; .0001) increased with increasing MMVD severity. An arrhythmia variable representing sinus arrhythmia (&quot;premature normals&quot;) (P &lt; .0001) and the HRV variable triangular index (TI) (P &lt; .0001) could distinguish CKCS with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation from CKCS in CHF in specific intervals. Among dogs in CHF, Holter-derived variables did not differ among breeds. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In CKCS, Holter-derived variables changed with MMVD severity. &quot;Premature normals&quot; and TI showed diagnostic potential. Breed differences were not seen among dogs in CHF secondary to MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nielsen, Line A</author><author>Zois, Nora E</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Tarnow, Inge</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platelet function in dogs: breed differences and effect of acetylsalicylic acid  administration.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>267-273</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aspirin</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Point-of-Care Systems</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17806075</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-165x.2007.tb00222.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Clinical studies investigating platelet function in dogs have had  conflicting results that may be caused by normal physiologic variation in platelet response to agonists. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate platelet function in clinically healthy dogs of 4 different breeds by whole-blood aggregometry and with a point-of-care platelet function analyzer (PFA-100), and to evaluate the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) administration on the results from both methods. METHODS: Forty-five clinically healthy dogs (12 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [CKCS], 12 Cairn Terriers, 10 Boxers, and 11 Labrador Retrievers) were included in the study. Platelet function was assessed by whole-blood aggregation with ADP (1, 5, 10, and 20 microM) as agonist and by PFA-100 using collagen and epinephrine (Col + Epi) and Col + ADP as agonists. Plasma thromboxane B(2) concentration was determined by an enzyme immunoassay. To investigate the effect of ASA, 10 dogs were dosed daily (75 or 250 mg ASA orally) for 4 consecutive days. RESULTS: A higher platelet aggregation response was found in CKCS compared to the other breeds. Longer PFA-100 closure time (Col + Epi) was found in Cairn Terriers compared to Boxers. Plasma thromboxane B(2) concentration was not statistically different between groups. Administration of ASA prolonged the PFA-100 closure times, using Col + Epi (but not Col + ADP) as agonists. Furthermore, ASA resulted in a decrease in whole-blood platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet function is influenced by breed, depending upon the methodology applied. However, the importance of these breed differences remains to be investigated. The PFA-100 method with Col + Epi as agonists, and ADP-induced platelet aggregation appear to be sensitive to ASA in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samii, V F</author><author>Hornof, W J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>147-153</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Swine Diseases</keyword><keyword>Swine, Miniature</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10779075</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2000.tb01469.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of humeral condylar  fractures in Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs and to postulate a possible predisposing cause for these fractures. Thirteen Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs (Group A) were evaluated over an eight year period (1990-1998), each with a history of either a unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness. The cause of lameness was localized to the elbow region. Of the thirteen pigs, twenty-one elbows were evaluated radiographically. Pigs ranged in age from six months to four years old. All pigs over the age of seven months showed radiographic evidence of elbow degenerative joint disease. Fractures involving the medial aspect of the humeral condyle were identified in 8/21 studies (38%). A well-defined linear intracondylar articular lucency was identified in 7/21 studies (33%) on the craniocaudal projection. The site of this lucency corresponded to the location of the articular component of the fractures seen involving the humeral condyle. The elbows of five pot-bellied pigs with no known history of forelimb lameness or trauma (Group B) were evaluated radiographically following euthanasia. All five pigs were of unknown age and gender. An intracondylar vertical linear lucency was identified bilaterally in three pigs (60%). Concurrent degenerative joint disease was present in all instances. The remaining two pigs were radiographically normal. Computed tomography of the elbows was performed in one affected pig from Group B. The radiographic findings in this pig were verified. Histopathology of the right elbow of this affected pig was diagnostic for incomplete endochondral ossification of the humeral condyle. A similar condition involving the humeral condyle has been previously described in Cocker and Brittany Spaniels. These canine breeds also have a high incidence of humeral condylar fractures. It is postulated that Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs are similarly prone to humeral condylar fractures, even in the absence of known trauma, due to incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Green, S L</author><author>Vulliet, P R</author><author>Pinter, M J</author><author>Cork, L C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alterations in cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (CDK5) protein levels, activity  and immunocytochemistry in canine motor neuron disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>1070-1077</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Axons</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunoblotting</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy, Spinal</keyword><keyword>Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Tissue Distribution</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9825944</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/00005072-199811000-00010</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA) is a dominantly inherited motor  neuron disease in Brittany spaniels that is clinically characterized by progressive muscle weakness leading to paralysis. Histopathologically, degeneration is confined to motor neurons with accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilaments in axonal internodes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a kinase related to the cell cycle kinase cdc2, phosphorylates neurofilaments and regulates neurofilament dynamics. We examined CDK5 activity, protein levels, and cellular immunoreactivity in nervous tissue from dogs with HCSMA, from closely age-matched controls and from dogs with other neurological diseases. On immunoblot analysis, CDK5 protein levels were increased in the HCSMA dogs (by approximately 1.5-fold in both the cytosolic and the particulate fractions). CDK5 activity was significantly increased (by approximately 3-fold) in the particulate fractions in the HCSMA dogs compared to all controls. The finding that CDK5 activity was increased in the young HCSMA homozygotes with the accelerated form of the disease, who do not show axonal swellings histologically, suggests that alterations in CDK5 occurs early in the pathogenesis, prior to the development of significant neurofilament pathology. Immunocytochemically, there was strong CDK5 staining of the nuclei, cytoplasm and axonal processes of the motor neurons in both control dogs and dogs with HCSMA. Further immunocytochemical studies demonstrated CDK5 staining where neurofilaments accumulated, in axonal swellings in the dogs with HCSMA. Our observations suggest phosphorylation-dependent events mediated by CDK5 occur in canine motor neuron disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chiang, Chih-Fan</author><author>Villaverde, Cecilia</author><author>Chang, Wei-Chih</author><author>Fascetti, Andrea J</author><author>Larsen, Jennifer A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Disease Associations of Overweight and Obesity in  Dogs that Visited the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis from January 2006 to December 2015.</title><secondary-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>100640</pages><volume>48</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Animal</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Teaching</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Overweight</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35104633</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tcam.2022.100640</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Overweight and obesity contribute to a variety of disease processes and  negatively affect quality of life in dogs. A considerable number of epidemiological studies performed in a variety of canine communities revealed varied prevalence, and identified associated risk factors, including neutering. Associations between excessive body weight and certain diseases, including orthopedic diseases, were also reported. However, risk factors and disease associations of overweight and obesity in a larger population of dogs seen in recent years at a single referral veterinary hospital remains undefined. The present study utilized descriptive statistics and logistic regression models to characterize prevalence, risk factors, and disease associations of excessive body weight (both overweight and obesity) in 40,038 dogs that visited the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis from January 2006 to December 2015. The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity in 40,038 dogs were 21.1% (n = 8461) and 20.2% (n = 8089) respectively. Dogs that were neutered, female, and considered middle-aged or senior were at increased risk of overweight and obesity. Certain breed types, including Retriever and Spaniel, and certain disease processes, including orthopedic diseases, were also at increased risk of overweight and obesity. Overweight and obesity are prevalent problems, which can benefit from continual education to raise awareness of the scale of the problem to both the veterinary community and the general public. Structured disease surveillance plans monitoring these associated factors also help to guide further research and to better prevent overweight and obesity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pegram, C</author><author>Raffan, E</author><author>White, E</author><author>Ashworth, A H</author><author>Brodbelt, D C</author><author>Church, D B</author><author>O'Neill, D G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Frequency, breed predisposition and demographic risk factors for overweight  status in dogs in the UK.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>521-530</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Overweight</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33754373</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13325</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for overweight status in  dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study design was used to estimate the 1-year (2016) period prevalence of overweight status. The clinical records were randomly ordered and manually validated for dogs with overweight status during 2016. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling were used to evaluate associations between risk factors (breed, brachycephalic status, adult bodyweight, bodyweight relative to breed-sex mean, age, sex-neuter and insurance) and overweight status. RESULTS: There were 1580 of 22,333 dogs identified as overweight during 2016. The estimated 1-year period prevalence for overweight status recorded in dogs under veterinary care was 7.1% (95% confidence interval 6.7-7.4). After accounting for confounding factors, eight breeds showed increased odds of overweight status compared with crossbred dogs. The breeds with the highest odds included the Pug (OR 3.12, 95% confidence interval 2.31 to 4.20), Beagle (OR 2.67, 1.75 to 4.08), Golden Retriever (OR 2.58, 1.79 to 3.74) and English Springer Spaniel (OR 1.98, 1.31 to 2.98). Being neutered, middle-aged and insured were additionally associated with overweight status. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Targeted overweight prevention strategies should be prioritised for predisposed breeds, such as Pugs and Beagles. The findings additionally raise questions about further preventative efforts following neutering. The prevalence estimate suggests veterinary professionals are underreporting overweight status and therefore could be missing key welfare opportunities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hewitt, Joshua S</author><author>Allbaugh, Rachel A</author><author>Kenne, Danielle E</author><author>Sebbag, Lionel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and Antibiotic Susceptibility of Bacterial Isolates From Dogs With  Ulcerative Keratitis in Midwestern United States.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>583965</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33330707</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2020.583965</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of this study was to describe bacterial culture and antibiotic  susceptibility results in 476 dogs presenting with suspected bacterial keratitis in Iowa and surrounding Midwestern states, further detailing trends in patient characteristics, seasonality, and antimicrobial resistance.

Compared to mixed-breed dogs, canine breeds most likely to be examined for ulcerative keratitis included Boston terrier, Cavalier King Charles spaniel, miniature pinscher, pug, rat terrier, Saint Bernard, shih tzu, and silky terriers. In summer, the likelihood to yield a negative culture was reduced while the likelihood to culture Pseudomonas species was increased. Bacteria considered multidrug resistant (MDR, resistant to ≥ 3 antibiotic classes) represented 20% of all canine isolates and were most prevalent for Staphylococcus species (33%). An alarming, escalating trend of MDR prevalence was noted between 2016 (5%) and 2020 (34%). Individual ophthalmic preparations (i.e., single antibiotics or commercially available antibiotic combinations) with highest efficacy against all bacterial isolates included chloramphenicol (83%), ceftiofur (79%), amikacin (77%), neomycin-polymyxin B-bacitracin (77%), and gentamicin (74%). Efficacy of systemic antibiotics and combinations of ophthalmic preparations was also evaluated. Based on the present findings, triple antibiotic (Neo-Poly-Bac) is recommended as empirical monotherapy for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in dogs with simple corneal ulcers, while a chloramphenicol-ciprofloxacin combination is empirically recommended for therapeutic management of infected corneal ulcers. Pending culture and susceptibility results, appropriate selection of empiric antibiotic therapy is important to enhance therapeutic outcome and reduce antibacterial resistance in dogs with corneal ulceration.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liatis, Theophanes</author><author>Cherubini, Giunio Bruto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monocular Nystagmus Representing Heimann - Bielschowsky Phenomenon in a Dog With  Ipsilateral Vision Loss.</title><secondary-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>100439</pages><volume>40</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blindness</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Nystagmus, Pathologic</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32690284</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100439</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6-year-old female-neutered vaccinated Cocker Spaniel presented for preadoption  neurological evaluation due to abnormal left-eye movements that had been noticed since young age. Clinical examination revealed left-eye cataract with a nonvisible left and a normal right retina on ophthalmoscopy. Neurological examination revealed absent left-sided menace response and cataract-related ipsilateral visual impairment, and intermittent left-sided abnormal eye movements consisted of intermittent, slow, coarse, variable amplitude, vertical movements of the eye that they were giving the impression of random movements of the eye within the globe as it was floating (&quot;wandering&quot; eye) interchangeable with periods of rest. Blood and infectious diseases tests were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was unremarkable, whilst cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed mildly inflammatory in the light of blood contamination. A presumptive diagnosis of meningoencephalitis of unknown origin was established and trial with dexamethasone was performed, however nystagmus remained unchanged 2 weeks post-treatment. Therefore, based on the fact that monocular nystagmus existed since youth and remained static, and the dog was otherwise neurological-sign-free regardless the discontinuation of steroids, the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis was considered as unlikely and a presumptive diagnosis of Heimann - Bielschowsky phenomenon of the left eye due to cataract-related ipsilateral visual impairment was established. This vergence eye movement abnormality also known as searching, wandering or amaurotic nystagmus is a constant or intermittent benign eye movement abnormality mostly related with vision impairment due to ophthalmological or neurological disease. Heimann - Bielschowsky phenomenon is an underreported eye abnormality in veterinary medicine. Although the most common type of eye movement abnormalities seen in veterinary practice is the bilateral conjugate jerk nystagmus, monocular nystagmus representing Heimann - Bielschowsky phenomenon exists in animals, it has been related with partial or complete vision impairment and it should be recognised by the clinicians.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harvey, J W</author><author>Calderwood Mays, M B</author><author>Gropp, K E</author><author>Denaro, F J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polysaccharide storage myopathy in canine phosphofructokinase deficiency (type  VII glycogen storage disease).</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Glycogen</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Storage Disease</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Muscles</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinase-1</keyword><keyword>Polysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Splenomegaly</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year></dates><accession-num>2137952</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/030098589002700101</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A severe, progressive myopathy developed in an 11-year-old, phosphofructokinase  (PFK)-deficient, male, English Springer Spaniel dog. Results from a routine neurological examination were normal. Examination of histologic sections of skeletal muscle revealed large accumulations of material in some myofibers. These deposits were pale, basophilic, somewhat flocculent, and slightly granular with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Most fascicles examined in sections of limb and trunk muscles were affected to some degree, with up to 10% of muscle fibers being involved. Deposits stained strongly with periodic acid-Schiff and were resistant to digestion by alpha amylase but were removed by incubation with gamma amylase. Deposits were faintly positive with Gomori's methenamine silver technique and alcian blue (pH 2.5) and were brown-gray with Lugol's iodine solution but were negative with other stains. Based on staining characteristics, the deposits seemed to consist primarily of an amylopectin-like polysaccharide(s). Alcian blue staining (pH 2.5) was removed by treatment with neuraminidase but not with hyaluronidase, indicating that some sialic acid residues were also present. Electron microscopically, the deposits were composed of short granular filaments, small granules and amorphous material. They were not membrane bound. The morphologic appearance and staining characteristics of the deposits were remarkably similar to deposits previously described in human PFK-deficient myopathy. As expected, total PFK activities were markedly reduced when assayed in skeletal muscles of this dog. In contrast with other PFK-deficient dogs, muscle glycogen in this animal was not increased above that of normal dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phillipps, Stephanie</author><author>DeDecker, Steven</author><author>Gutierrez-Quintana, Rodrigo</author><author>Alcoverro, Emili</author><author>Gomes, Sergio A</author><author>Goncalves, Rita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Idiopathic generalised tremor syndrome in dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>e1734</pages><volume>191</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diazepam</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Tremor</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35700269</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vetr.1734</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic generalised tremor syndrome (IGTS) causes tremor and often  vestibulocerebellar signs. Previous publications on IGTS in dogs are restricted to case reports or lack exclusion of structural causes. METHODS: Medical records of 75 dogs diagnosed with IGTS that had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Crossbreeds were affected most commonly (41.3%), followed by West Highland white terriers (14.7%) and cocker spaniels (10.7%). A higher proportion of females were affected than males (68.0%). Median age of the affected dogs was 17 months (range 6-121 months), and median bodyweight was 9.15 kg (range 2.9-26 kg). All dogs presented with tremors and most experienced concomitant neurological signs (93.3%). Seventeen (22.7%) were hyperthermic and 31 (41.3%) had gastrointestinal signs. MRI of the brain was normal in most of the cases, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis frequently revealed mild pleocytosis. All animals were treated with prednisolone, and 39 (51.3%) also received diazepam. Median follow-up time was 13 months (range 0-134 months). The overall outcome was good, although 16 (21.3%) patients were reported to have relapsing clinical signs and 10 (13.2%) patients experienced persistent mild clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: IGTS should be suspected in any dog with generalised tremor and vestibulocerebellar signs with younger and smaller dogs more commonly affected.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reimann, M J</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Møller, J E</author><author>Lykkesfeldt, J</author><author>Falk, T</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Markers of Oxidative Stress in Dogs with Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease are  Influenced by Sex, Neuter Status, and Serum Cholesterol Concentration.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>295-302</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Lipoproteins, LDL</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Malondialdehyde</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Vitamin E</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28132441</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14647</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease has been associated with oxidative stress,  which has been suggested to contribute to myocardial remodeling in human patients. Little is known about the relationship between myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and oxidative stress in dogs. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical stage of MMVD is associated with changes in the plasma concentrations of certain markers of oxidative stress in clinically healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. ANIMALS: Seventy five privately owned dogs: 59 cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with different severities of MMVD and 16 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by MMVD. METHODS: Markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and vitamin E (α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol) were measured in plasma and their association with clinical stage of MMVD was assessed by regression analyses. RESULTS: Plasma oxLDL concentration was significantly lower in female dogs compared with males (P = .01). Significantly higher plasma γ-tocopherol concentrations were found in neutered (P = .003) dogs. Vitamin E (α-tocopherol [P = .0004] and γ-tocopherol [P = .003]) was associated with body condition score (BCS), but the association disappeared when cholesterol was included in the analyses. All markers of oxidative stress (MDA, oxLDL, and vitamin E) were positively associated with serum cholesterol concentration (P ≤ .04), but none were associated with clinical stage of MMVD. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, markers of oxidative stress are associated with sex, BCS, neuter status, and cholesterol. The results cannot confirm a relationship between oxidative stress and clinical stage of the disease in dogs with MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarnow, Inge</author><author>Kristensen, Annemarie T</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Falk, Torkel</author><author>Haubro, Lotte</author><author>Pedersen, Lotte G</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dogs with heart diseases causing turbulent high-velocity blood flow have changes  in platelet function and von Willebrand factor multimer distribution.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>515-522</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aortic Stenosis, Subvalvular</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand Factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16095168</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2005)19[515:dwhdct]2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate platelet function using  in vitro tests based on both high and low shear rates and von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimeric composition in dogs with cardiac disease and turbulent high-velocity blood flow. Client-owned asymptomatic, untreated dogs were divided into 4 groups: 14 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (Cavaliers) with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 17 Cavaliers with MVP and moderate to severe MR, 14 control dogs, and 10 dogs with subaortic stenosis (SAS). Clinical examinations and echocardiography were performed in all dogs. PFA100 closure times (the ability of platelets to occlude a hole in a membrane at high shear rates), platelet activation markers (plasma thromboxane B2 concentration, platelet surface P-selectin expression), platelet aggregation (in whole blood and platelet-rich plasma with 3 different agonists), and vWf multimers were analyzed. Cavaliers with moderate to severe MR and dogs with SAS had longer closure times and a lower percentage of the largest vWf multimers than did controls. Maximal aggregation responses were unchanged in dogs with SAS but enhanced in Cavaliers with MVP (regardless of MR status) compared with control dogs. No significant difference in platelet activation markers was found among groups. The data suggest that a form of platelet dysfunction detected at high shear rates was present in dogs with MR and SAS, possibly associated with a qualitative vWf defect. Aggregation results suggest increased platelet reactivity in Cavaliers, but the platelets did not appear to circulate in a preactivated state in either disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author><author>Schütt, Trine</author><author>Søndergaard, Rikke</author><author>Qvortrup, Karen</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Kristensen, Annemarie T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decreased plasma concentration of nitric oxide metabolites in dogs with untreated  mitral regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>178-184</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Nitrates</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Nitrites</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12683618</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2003.tb02431.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Endothelium-dependent (nitric oxide [NO]-mediated) vasodilation is impaired in  humans with heart failure. This dysfunction is an important therapeutic target. The plasma concentration of the NO metabolites nitrate and nitrite (collectively referred to as NOx) is a measure of whole-body NO production, provided that the dietary intake of the ions is low. Fifty clinically healthy dogs older than I year (median 5.0 years; interquartile interval 2.6-8.2 years) were studied, including 9 controls of various breeds, 23 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) with no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 9 CKCSs with mild MR (regurgitant jet occupying 15-50% of the left atrial area), and 9 CKCS with moderate to severe MR (jet &gt;50%) due to myxomatous valve disease. None of the dogs received medication. The dogs were given NOx-free water and a diet with a low concentration of NOx for 96 hours before blood sampling. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that dog group, but not gender, age, serum creatinine concentration, and platelet count, was associated with NOx concentrations. Control dogs had the same NOx concentration (median 20.0 microM; interquartile interval 15.1-25.5 microM) as CKCSs without MR (median 18.7 microM; interquartile interval 15.5-25.9 microM). Compared to CKCSs without MR, the NOx concentration was lower in CKCSs with mild (median 12.9 microM; interquartile interval 11.0-13.5 microM; P = .04) and moderate to severe (median 11.2 microM; interquartile interval 6.9-17.1 microM; P = .02) MR. In conclusion, CKCSs with mild to severe, clinically silent MR have decreased plasma NOx concentrations, suggesting that endothelial dysfunction develops early in the course of developing MR in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Milne, Elspeth</author><author>Nuttall, Tim</author><author>Marioni-Henry, Katia</author><author>Piccinelli, Chiara</author><author>Schwarz, Tobias</author><author>Azar, Ali</author><author>Harris, Jennifer</author><author>Duncan, Juliet</author><author>Cheeseman, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytological and microbiological characteristics of middle ear effusions in  brachycephalic dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1454-1463</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Atopic</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Exudates and Transudates</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Otoscopy</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32407559</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15792</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Middle ear effusion is common in brachycephalic dogs with  similarities to otitis media with effusion in children. Association with the cranial and eustachian tube morphology and bacterial infection is suspected in both species. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine cytological and bacteriological features of middle ear effusions in dogs, provide information on histological features, and further assess the dog as a model of the human disease. ANIMALS: Sixteen live dogs, 3 postmortem cases of middle ear effusion, and 2 postmortem controls. METHODS: Prospective; clinical investigation using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, video-otoscopy, myringotomy; cytological assessment of 30 and bacteriology of 28 effusions; histology and immunohistochemistry (CD3 for T-lymphocytes, Pax5 for B lymphocytes and MAC387 for macrophages) of 10 middle ear sections. RESULTS: Effusions were associated with neurological deficits in 6/16 (38%) and concurrent atopic dermatitis and otitis externa in 9/16 (56%) of live cases. Neutrophils and macrophages predominated on cytology (median 60 [range 2%-95.5%] and 27 [2%-96.5%]) whether culture of effusions was positive or not. In histology sections, the mucosa was thickened in affected dogs but submucosal gland dilatation occurred in affected and unaffected dogs. There was no bacterial growth from 22/28 (79%) of effusions. Bacteria isolated from the other 6 (21%) were predominantly Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (4/6, 67%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clinical, morphological, and cytological findings in middle ear effusions of dogs and people suggest similar pathogeneses. Middle ear effusion of dogs could be a useful model of human otitis media with effusion. Such comparisons can improve understanding and management across species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akiyoshi, Makoto</author><author>Hisasue, Masaharu</author><author>Asakawa, Midori Goto</author><author>Neo, Sakurako</author><author>Akiyoshi, Masami</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatosplenic lymphoma and visceral mast cell tumor in the liver of a dog with  synchronous and multiple primary tumors.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>414-421</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma</keyword><keyword>Mast Cells</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms, Multiple Primary</keyword><keyword>Splenic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35909229</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.13086</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 11-year-old spayed female American Cocker Spaniel was presented with a 4-week  history of anorexia and a 1-week history of abdominal distension. Clinicopathologic and imaging abnormalities included intra-abdominal hemorrhage, granular lymphocytes (GLs) in abdominal fluid smears, a splenic mass, and hepatomegaly with diffuse multiple hypoechogenic nodules. Based on the cytologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical evaluation of the spleen and liver, the diagnosis was hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) of GLs. Postoperatively, the dog was maintained in good condition with chemotherapy (ACNU [nimustine], L-asparaginase, and prednisolone). However, on day 85, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the liver revealed a proliferation in neoplastic mast cells not associated with the GLs. The dog was diagnosed with a visceral mast cell tumor (MCT) originating from the liver. The chemotherapy was switched to vinblastine and toceranib. The dog remained in good condition until day 141 but died due to the progression of MCT on day 158. Liver cytology on day 155 showed no GLs, although HSTCL is thought to be resistant to chemotherapy. After the definitive diagnosis of HSTCL, we monitored this patient's response to chemotherapy with blood tests, including complete blood counts, ultrasound imaging, and cytologic aspirates of liver. Although canine HSTCL has a poor prognosis, the possibility of a new neoplasm, including visceral MCT, should be considered. Periodic liver cytology might be worthwhile in dogs receiving chemotherapy for HSTCL.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Romito, Giovanni</author><author>Bertaglia, Teresa</author><author>Bertaglia, Luigi</author><author>Decaro, Nicola</author><author>Uva, Annamaria</author><author>Rugna, Gianluca</author><author>Moreno, Ana</author><author>Vincifori, Giacomo</author><author>Dondi, Francesco</author><author>Diana, Alessia</author><author>Cipone, Mario</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myocardial Injury Complicated by Systolic Dysfunction in a COVID-19-Positive Dog.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34944281</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani11123506</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A six-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel was referred with a two-month  history of severe exercise intolerance and syncope.

Cardiologic assessment documented myocardial injury complicated by systolic dysfunction. An extensive diagnostic work-up allowed us to rule out common causes of myocardial compromise, both infective and not. Accordingly, serological and molecular tests aimed at diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection were subsequently performed, especially in light of the dog's peculiar history.

At its final evolutionary step, treatments are limited to the percutaneous or surgical valve replacement, whatever the original cause of the degeneration. Understanding early molecular mechanisms that regulate valve interstitial cells remodeling and disease progression is challenging and could pave the way for future drugs aiming to prevent and/or reverse the process. Some valve degenerative processes such as the carcinoid heart disease, drug-induced valvulopathy and degenerative mitral valve disease in small-breed dogs are clearly linked to serotonin. The carcinoid heart is typically characterized by a right-sided valve dysfunction, observed in patients with carcinoid tumors developed from serotonin-producing gut enterochromaffin cells. Fenfluramine or ergot derivatives were linked to mitral and aortic valve dysfunction and share in common the pharmacological property of being 5-HT(2B) receptor agonists. Finally, some small-breed dogs, such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel are highly prone to degenerative mitral valve disease with a prevalence of 40% at 4 years-old, 70% at 7 years-old and 100% in 10-year-old animals. This degeneration has been linked to high serum serotonin, 5-HT(2B) receptor overexpression and SERT downregulation. Through the comprehension of serotonergic mechanisms involved into these specific situations, new therapeutic approaches could be extended to HVD in general. More recently, a serotonin dependent/ receptor independent mechanism has been suggested in congenital mitral valve prolapse through the filamin-A serotonylation. This review summarizes clinical and molecular mechanisms linking the serotonergic system and heart valve disease, opening the way for future pharmacological research in the field.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heller, Amanda R</author><author>van der Woerdt, Alexandra</author><author>Gaarder, James E</author><author>Sapienza, John S</author><author>Hernandez-Merino, Elena</author><author>Abrams, Kenneth</author><author>Church, Melanie L</author><author>La Croix, Noelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sudden acquired retinal degeneration in dogs: breed distribution of 495 canines.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>103-106</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electroretinography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>26938661</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12370</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe breed, age, gender, and weight  distribution of dogs affected with sudden acquired retinal degeneration (SARD) and to investigate whether SARD is more common in small breed dogs. METHODS: Medical records of dogs diagnosed with SARD confirmed by an electroretinogram were reviewed. Breed, age, gender, and weight were recorded when available. The same data were obtained for dogs with SARD described in the veterinary literature. RESULTS: Three hundred and two dogs were included from the ophthalmology practices and 193 dogs from the veterinary literature. Sixty breeds were present in the study. Mixed-breed dogs were the most common at 108 dogs (21.8%), followed by the Dachshund (68, 13.7%), Chinese Pug (44, 8.9%), Miniature Schnauzer (39, 7.9%), Maltese (23, 4.6%), Cocker Spaniel (22, 4.4%), Bichon Frise (18, 3.6%), Beagle (16, 3.2%), Brittany (15, 3.0%), and Pomeranian (10, 2.0%). Fifty other breeds were represented by 1-9 dogs each. The median age was 9 years (range = 10 months-16 years). The weight was known for 197 dogs. About 60.9% of dogs were less than 25 pounds, 31.5% were between 25 and 50 pounds, and 7.6% were greater than 50 pounds. Gender was recorded in 393 dogs: 217 female dogs and 176 male dogs. CONCLUSIONS: As previously reported, SARD is most common in middle-aged to older dogs. Smaller dogs of less than 25 pounds appear overrepresented, while large/giant breed dogs of greater than 50 pounds are infrequently diagnosed. In this study, there was no statistical significance between female and male dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forman, Oliver P</author><author>Penderis, Jacques</author><author>Hartley, Claudia</author><author>Hayward, Louisa J</author><author>Ricketts, Sally L</author><author>Mellersh, Cathryn S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parallel mapping and simultaneous sequencing reveals deletions in BCAN and FAM83H  associated with discrete inherited disorders in a domestic dog breed.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>e1002462</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Sequence Deletion</keyword><keyword>Skin Diseases</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22253609</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1002462</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) segregates more naturally-occurring diseases  and phenotypic variation than any other species and has become established as an unparalled model with which to study the genetics of inherited traits. We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and targeted resequencing of DNA from just five dogs to simultaneously map and identify mutations for two distinct inherited disorders that both affect a single breed, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. We investigated episodic falling (EF), a paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia, alongside the phenotypically distinct condition congenital keratoconjunctivitis sicca and ichthyosiform dermatosis (CKCSID), commonly known as dry eye curly coat syndrome. EF is characterised by episodes of exercise-induced muscular hypertonicity and abnormal posturing, usually occurring after exercise or periods of excitement. CKCSID is a congenital disorder that manifests as a rough coat present at birth, with keratoconjunctivitis sicca apparent on eyelid opening at 10-14 days, followed by hyperkeratinisation of footpads and distortion of nails that develops over the next few months. We undertook a GWAS with 31 EF cases, 23 CKCSID cases, and a common set of 38 controls and identified statistically associated signals for EF and CKCSID on chromosome 7 (P(raw) 1.9×10(-14); P(genome) = 1.0×10(-5)) and chromosome 13 (P(raw) 1.2×10(-17); P(genome) = 1.0×10(-5)), respectively. We resequenced both the EF and CKCSID disease-associated regions in just five dogs and identified a 15,724 bp deletion spanning three exons of BCAN associated with EF and a single base-pair exonic deletion in FAM83H associated with CKCSID. Neither BCAN or FAM83H have been associated with equivalent disease phenotypes in any other species, thus demonstrating the ability to use the domestic dog to study the genetic basis of more than one disease simultaneously in a single breed and to identify multiple novel candidate genes in parallel.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michau, T M</author><author>Breitschwerdt, E B</author><author>Gilger, B C</author><author>Davidson, M G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bartonella vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi as a possible cause of anterior uveitis  and choroiditis in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>299-304</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bartonella</keyword><keyword>Bartonella Infections</keyword><keyword>Choroiditis</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Uveitis, Anterior</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>14641826</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2003.00310.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 2-year old, neutered, female spaniel mixed breed was referred to the North  Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of bilateral anterior uveitis. The dog was febrile and, in addition to anterior uveitis, multifocal hyporeflective lesions were present in the tapetal fundus of both eyes. The antibody titer for Bartonella vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi was positive (1 : 512). Aqueous paracentesis was performed for PCR in an attempt to detect B. vinsonii in the eye but was unsuccessful. The ocular manifestations of Bartonella infection in humans are currently expanding as more sensitive serologic and PCR techniques are being developed to identify Bartonella spp. In addition to optic neuritis and neuroretinitis, retinochoroidal lesions are one of the most common manifestations of B. henselae infection, and are frequently accompanied by vitreous or anterior segment inflammation. Diagnosis of a Bartonella infection in humans can be made on serology alone, in conjunction with ocular examination findings. The ultimate proof of B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) as a direct cause of ocular disease would be detection of the infectious agent in the eye. However, it is unknown at this time whether Bartonella causes ocular disease primarily, secondarily via an autoimmune reaction, or both. Due to the difficulties associated with culture of Bartonella spp. and the limitations of PCR, serology is currently the most useful tool for screening dogs for possible Bartonella spp. infection. In the case presented here, even though the PCR was negative, the clinical signs of anterior uveitis and choroiditis might reasonably be associated with B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) seroreactivity, which was repeatable on three separate occasions. Clinical improvement was also accompanied by a post-treatment decrease in B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) seroreactivity, potentially supporting resolution of Bartonella infection in this dog. This is the first reported case of a possible association between uveitis, choroiditis and Bartonella infection in the dog, without clinical manifestations of other organ or tissue involvement. Future studies based on PCR analysis of intraocular fluids may clarify the involvement of B. vinsonii (berkhoffi) in dogs with intraocular inflammatory disease. Furthermore, performing fluorescein angiography in dogs with elevated Bartonella titers may also prove useful in the identification and characterization of lesions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Power, J M</author><author>Tonkin, A M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large animal models of heart failure.</title><secondary-title>Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>395-402</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiac Pacing, Artificial</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Dysfunction, Left</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10868511</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1445-5994.1999.tb00734.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Congestive heart failure (HF) is a major focus of medical research. Its incidence  has greatly increased in recent decades because of an aging population base and the increasingly successful treatment of other forms of chronic cardiac disease. Relevant large animal models of HF should reflect the complex interactions of cardiac dysfunction, neurohumoral dynamics and peripheral vascular abnormalities found in human HF. A number of large animal models have been developed, especially in dogs, sheep and swine, using naturally occurring HF, or single or combinations of interventions, as instruments to trigger the development of HF. Naturally occurring HF models are not commonly used because of ethical or perceived ethical grounds, however, King Charles Cavalier Spaniel and Yucatan Mini Pig models have been described. Tachycardia induced HF is the most commonly used HF model. Ventricular pacing at 220-240 bpm results in profound low output, biventricular, oedematous failure in two to three weeks. Lower pacing rates result in a more stable, sustainable, lesser degree of failure. Positive features of this model include 'acceptance', aetiological relevance to patient tachycardia induced HF, neurohumoral and functional profile similar to most human HF, relatively low cost simple preparation, ability to manipulate the degree of failure with pacing rate, reversibility, reliability and a large amount of published multi species data. Limitations to the use of the model are the rapid onset, the fact that reversibility is only relevant to the tachycardia induced patient HF, the absence of hypertrophy in failure, the diminished plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, absence of ANP of ventricular origin, and the interference between rapid pacing and therapeutic interventions. Myocardial damage models of HF include those models induced by ischaemia, eg due to coronary occlusion (ligation or aneroid) or intracoronary microembolism, transmyocardial DC shock, toxic cardiomyopathy from adriamycin, doxorubicin or catecholamines. Overload models of HF may be induced by high pressure from aortic constriction, aortic regurgitation, renal artery constriction, pulmonary stenosis or aortocaval shunts, or by induction of mitral regurgitation from chordae or leaflet damage. No single, all-encompassing, large animal model of HF exists to date. Selection of the type of model to be used should be based primarily on the hypotheses to be tested and secondarily on the available resources and facilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sjöstrand, K</author><author>Wess, G</author><author>Ljungvall, I</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Merveille, A-C</author><author>Wiberg, M</author><author>Gouni, V</author><author>Lundgren Willesen, J</author><author>Hanås, S</author><author>Lequarré, A-S</author><author>Mejer Sørensen, L</author><author>Wolf, J</author><author>Tiret, L</author><author>Kierczak, M</author><author>Forsberg, S</author><author>McEntee, K</author><author>Battaille, G</author><author>Seppälä, E</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, K</author><author>Georges, M</author><author>Lohi, Hannes</author><author>Chetboul, V</author><author>Fredholm, M</author><author>Höglund, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed differences in natriuretic peptides in healthy dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>451-457</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrial Natriuretic Factor</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Natriuretic Peptide, Brain</keyword><keyword>Natriuretic Peptides</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24495256</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12310</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Measurement of plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides (NPs) is  suggested to be of value in diagnosis of cardiac disease in dogs, but many factors other than cardiac status may influence their concentrations. Dog breed potentially is 1 such factor. OBJECTIVE: To investigate breed variation in plasma concentrations of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide 31-67 (proANP 31-67) and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 535 healthy, privately owned dogs of 9 breeds were examined at 5 centers as part of the European Union (EU) LUPA project. METHODS: Absence of cardiovascular disease or other clinically relevant organ-related or systemic disease was ensured by thorough clinical investigation. Plasma concentrations of proANP 31-67 and NT-proBNP were measured by commercially available ELISA assays. RESULTS: Overall significant breed differences were found in proANP 31-67 (P &lt; .0001) and NT-proBNP (P &lt; .0001) concentrations. Pair-wise comparisons between breeds differed in approximately 50% of comparisons for proANP 31-67 as well as NT-proBNP concentrations, both when including all centers and within each center. Interquartile range was large for many breeds, especially for NT-proBNP. Among included breeds, Labrador Retrievers and Newfoundlands had highest median NT-proBNP concentrations with concentrations 3 times as high as those of Dachshunds. German Shepherds and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels had the highest median proANP 31-67 concentrations, twice the median concentration in Doberman Pinschers. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Considerable interbreed variation in plasma NP concentrations was found in healthy dogs. Intrabreed variation was large in several breeds, especially for NT-proBNP. Additional studies are needed to establish breed-specific reference ranges.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carr, Anthony P</author><author>Panciera, David L</author><author>Kidd, Linda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prognostic factors for mortality and thromboembolism in canine immune-mediated  hemolytic anemia: a retrospective study of 72 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>504-509</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Prothrombin Time</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Embolism</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Vaccination</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12322697</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2002)016&lt;0504:pffmat&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Medical records of 72 dogs diagnosed with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA)  were reviewed to find risk factors for the disease, for mortality, and for thromboembolism. Coagulation data of 32 patients were evaluated for mortality or thromboembolism risk factors. Cocker Spaniels were at increased risk for IMHA (P = .012). Timing of vaccination was not associated with development of IMHA. PCV ranged from 5 to 33%, with a mean of 16 +/- 5%. Autoagglutination was present in 42% of the dogs. Platelet counts (n = 60) varied from 3,000 to 793,000/microL (mean, 160,117 +/- 133,571; median, 144,000). Thrombocytopenia (platelet count, &lt;200,000/microL) was present in 70% of the dogs, with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, &lt;50,000/microL) being present in 22%. One-step prothrombin time (OSPT) was prolonged in 28% of the dogs tested, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was prolonged in 47% of the dogs tested. Fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs) were detected in 16 of 28 dogs tested (57%). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diagnosed in 10 of 31 (32%) dogs and was suspected in 8 dogs. Thromboemboli were found in 20 of 25 dogs given postmortem examinations. Mortality rate was 58%. Thrombocytopenia (P = .008) and serum bilirubin concentration of &gt;5 mg/dL (P = .015) were risk factors for mortality, and hypoalbuminemia approached significance (P = .053). Severe thrombocytopenia (P = .046), serum bilirubin concentration of &gt;5 mg/dL (P = .038), and hypoalbuminemia (P = .016) were risk factors for thromboembolism. On evaluation of continuous data, decreased platelet count (P = .057), increased bilirubin (P = .062), and decreased albumin (P = .054) approached significance for decreased survival. A higher risk for thrombosis was found with increased alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) (P = .042), increased bilirubin (P = .047), and decreased albumin (P = .012).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goh, J</author><author>Eramanis, L M</author><author>Milne, M</author><author>Stent, A</author><author>Boller, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brain magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology findings in a dog with global  brain ischaemia following cardiopulmonary arrest.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>433-439</pages><volume>100</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Ischemia</keyword><keyword>Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Arrest</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35656570</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.13178</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Global brain ischaemia following cardiopulmonary arrest is uncommonly  reported in veterinary medicine yet neurologic injury after arrest is a known morbidity. CASE REPORT: An 18-week-old male entire Cavalier King Charles Spaniel-Poodle was referred following 3 days of neurologic abnormalities after cardiopulmonary arrest. After resuscitation, the animal had decerebrate rigidity, a stuporous mentation and intermittent episodes of vocalisation and apnoea. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken 4 days after cardiopulmonary arrest, with standard sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) as well as diffusion-weighted imaging to better discern ischaemic injury and cytotoxic oedema for prognostic reasons. MRI findings were consistent with global brain ischaemia affecting the hippocampus, cerebellum and substantia nigra, the latter two not previously identified in canine cases of global brain ischaemia. The patient was euthanased on day eight post-cardiopulmonary arrest due to a lack of neurological improvement and developing sepsis as a complication. Ante-mortem identification of affected areas of the brain was confirmed on histological examination, with evidence of ischaemic injury seen in the cerebrum, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal nuclei and thalamus. CONCLUSION: This report describes ante-mortem MRI and postmortem findings in a dog with global brain ischaemia following cardiopulmonary arrest. A multimodal approach to neuroprognostication in patients recovering from cardiopulmonary arrest is recommended.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sophocleous, R A</author><author>Sluyter, V</author><author>Curtis, B L</author><author>Curtis, S J</author><author>Jurak, L M</author><author>Faulks, M</author><author>Spildrejorde, M</author><author>Gates, S</author><author>Proctor, E-J</author><author>Seavers, A</author><author>Watson, D</author><author>Kuit, T</author><author>Dowton, M</author><author>Stokes, L</author><author>Sluyter, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of a P2RX7 gene missense variant with brachycephalic dog breeds.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>127-131</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Purinergic P2X7</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31774195</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/age.12884</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Missense variants are associated with various phenotypic traits and disorders in  dogs. The canine P2RX7 gene, coding the ATP-gated P2X7 receptor ion channel, contains four known missense variants. The current study aimed to examine the presence of these variants in a random sample of pedigree and mixed-pedigree dogs. Exons 3, 8, 11 and 13 of the P2RX7 gene, encoding these four respective variants, in 65 dogs were assessed by Sanger sequencing and combined with existing sequencing data from another 69 dogs. The distribution of these variants was then evaluated in all 134 dogs combined and separately within individual breeds including 35 different pure breeds. The rs23314713 (p.Phe103Leu) and rs23315462 (p.Pro452Ser) variants were present in 47 and 40% of all dogs studied respectively, with the rs23314713 variant associated with brachycephalic breeds. Among pedigree dogs, the rs23314713 and rs23315462 variants were associated with brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic breeds respectively. The rs851148233 (p.Arg270Cys) and rs850760787 (p.Arg365Gln) variants were present only in dogs of Cocker Spaniel and Labrador Retriever pedigrees respectively. No other missense variants were found in exons 3, 8, 11 and 13 of the P2RX7 gene within the dogs. In conclusion, the rs23314713 and rs23315462 missense variants of the P2RX7 gene are present in a large proportion of dogs, with the rs23314713 variant associated with a number of brachycephalic breeds. However, the association of this variant with dogs of bulldog ancestry, not brachycephaly per se, cannot be excluded.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mendelsohn, Danielle</author><author>Lewis, John R</author><author>Scott, Kristin Iglesias</author><author>Brown, Dorothy C</author><author>Reiter, Alexander M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinicopathological Features, Risk Factors and Predispositions, and Response to  Treatment of Eosinophilic Oral Disease in 24 Dogs (2000-2016).</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary dentistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary dentistry</full-title></periodical><pages>25-31</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eosinophilic Granuloma</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mouth Diseases</keyword><keyword>New Jersey</keyword><keyword>Pennsylvania</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31138045</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0898756419834785</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objectives of this study were to retrospectively describe clinicopathological  features of eosinophilic oral disease in dogs, to identify possible risk factors or predispositions to the condition, and to report overall treatment response. Canine medical records from a veterinary teaching hospital and private referral practice over a 17-year period were reviewed for a diagnosis of eosinophilic oral disease. Twenty-four dogs with 26 lesions met the inclusion criteria. Patient mean age and body weight were 6.8 (3.8) years and 13.4 kg, respectively. Fifteen breeds were represented including Cavalier King Charles spaniel (16.7%), Labrador retriever (12.5%), and West Highland white terrier (12.5%). Eosinophilic lesions were found in the palate (65.4%), tongue (26.9%), and other oral locations (7.7%). Median follow-up time was 5 months. Analysis revealed statistically significant associations between lesion location and body weight (palatal and tongue lesions were more likely in smaller dogs, whereas lesions in the other category [lip or mucosa] were more likely in larger dogs). There was a correlation in lesion location and resolution (all dogs with palatal lesions became asymptomatic at their last recheck), and resolution and the use of antibiotics plus prednisone (greater likelihood of resolution without the use of this combination). Seventy percent of asymptomatic dogs resolved without medication or with allergen therapy alone, suggesting that asymptomatic dogs may respond well to conservative management. No associations were found between lesion location and breed, signalment and response to therapy, lesion resolution and the use of glucocorticoids, or significance of peripheral eosinophilia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hemmatzadeh, F</author><author>Niap, F</author><author>Bennett, B A</author><author>Trott, D J</author><author>Peaston, A E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel quantitative polymerase chain reaction to monitor urinary tract  mycoplasma infection in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Letters in applied microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Letters in applied microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>409-414</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mycoplasma</keyword><keyword>Mycoplasma Infections</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Ureaplasma</keyword><keyword>Ureaplasma Infections</keyword><keyword>Urinary Tract Infections</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30793339</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/lam.13139</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The aim of the study was to develop a quantitative real-time PCR assay for  diagnosis and monitoring of mycoplasma urinary tract infections (UTI) in a dog. An English Cocker Spaniel dog with the history of urinary tract infection was physically examined and laboratory findings identified chronic renal insufficiency and urinary tract infection. Attempts to culture organisms from pyuric urine failed, and empirical antibiotic therapy did not resolve the pyuria. A mycoplasma species most closely resembling Ureaplasma canigenitalium was identified in urine samples by conventional PCR and sequencing. A quantitative PCR method was developed to monitor and finally verify successful treatment. This novel approach to monitoring mycoplasma urinary tract infections is conceptually simple, and provides rapid results. It may have wider application in monitoring treatment efficacy for infections with other Mycoplasma spp. as well as additional organisms that are difficult to culture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, we highlight two different findings, detection of Ureaplasma canigenitalium in a dog with chronic urinary tract infection and development of a quantitative real-time PCR test to track treatment results in an infected dog. This report is the first report of detection of U. canigenitalium in one dog in Australia. This novel qPCR method for monitoring mycoplasma urinary tract infections is conceptually simple and provides results fast. It will have wider applications in monitoring treatment efficacy for infections with mycoplasmas and mycoplasma-like organisms that are difficult to culture, and provides a sensitive guide to treatment progress.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Donner, Jonas</author><author>Kaukonen, Maria</author><author>Anderson, Heidi</author><author>Möller, Fredrik</author><author>Kyöstilä, Kaisa</author><author>Sankari, Satu</author><author>Hytönen, Marjo</author><author>Giger, Urs</author><author>Lohi, Hannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic Panel Screening of Nearly 100 Mutations Reveals New Insights into the  Breed Distribution of Risk Variants for Canine Hereditary Disorders.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0161005</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type IV</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dwarfism</keyword><keyword>Factor VII</keyword><keyword>Genetic Counseling</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha Chains</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Uric Acid</keyword><keyword>Urolithiasis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27525650</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0161005</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The growing number of identified genetic disease risk variants across  dog breeds challenges the current state-of-the-art of population screening, veterinary molecular diagnostics, and genetic counseling. Multiplex screening of such variants is now technologically feasible, but its practical potential as a supportive tool for canine breeding, disease diagnostics, pet care, and genetics research is still unexplored. RESULTS: To demonstrate the utility of comprehensive genetic panel screening, we tested nearly 7000 dogs representing around 230 breeds for 93 disease-associated variants using a custom-designed genotyping microarray (the MyDogDNA® panel test). In addition to known breed disease-associated mutations, we discovered 15 risk variants in a total of 34 breeds in which their presence was previously undocumented. We followed up on seven of these genetic findings to demonstrate their clinical relevance. We report additional breeds harboring variants causing factor VII deficiency, hyperuricosuria, lens luxation, von Willebrand's disease, multifocal retinopathy, multidrug resistance, and rod-cone dysplasia. Moreover, we provide plausible molecular explanations for chondrodysplasia in the Chinook, cerebellar ataxia in the Norrbottenspitz, and familiar nephropathy in the Welsh Springer Spaniel. CONCLUSIONS: These practical examples illustrate how genetic panel screening represents a comprehensive, efficient and powerful diagnostic and research discovery tool with a range of applications in veterinary care, disease research, and breeding. We conclude that several known disease alleles are more widespread across different breeds than previously recognized. However, careful follow up studies of any unexpected discoveries are essential to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, as is readiness to provide genetic counseling on their implications for the dog and its breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Callan, M B</author><author>Bennett, J S</author><author>Phillips, D K</author><author>Haskins, M E</author><author>Hayden, J E</author><author>Anderson, J G</author><author>Giger, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inherited platelet delta-storage pool disease in dogs causing severe bleeding: an  animal model for a specific ADP deficiency.</title><secondary-title>Thrombosis and haemostasis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Thrombosis and haemostasis</full-title></periodical><pages>949-953</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenine Nucleotides</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>Hemostasis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation</keyword><keyword>Platelet Storage Pool Deficiency</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8571327</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The nature of a disorder producing moderate to severe bleeding after minor  trauma, venipuncture, and surgery was studied in 3 families of American cocker spaniel dogs. In the 5 affected dogs tested, platelet counts and measurements of plasma coagulant function and von Willebrand factor were normal. However, bleeding times were prolonged in 4 of the 5 affected dogs tested, and platelet aggregation in response to ADP and collagen was consistently abnormal in 3, suggesting that the bleeding disorder was due to abnormal platelet function. Measurements of 14C-serotonin uptake and retention by the affected platelets were normal. However, their ADP content was decreased, while their ATP content was normal, resulting in a mean ATP/ADP ratio of 8.32, compared to a mean ratio of 1.9 in normal canine platelets. Electron microscopy revealed that the number and appearance of the dense granules in the affected platelets were indistinguishable from those of normal controls. These studies suggest that this bleeding disorder results from a deficient delta-granule storage pool of ADP; given the normal serotonin uptake and retention by affected platelets and the apparently normal number of dense granules, the ADP deficiency may be the consequence of a selective defect in delta-granule ADP transport. Additional studies of this unique platelet disorder will provide an opportunity to understand the mechanism of adenine nucleotide storage in platelet delta-granules.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoon, Hyun-Jeong</author><author>Kim, Joon-Young</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in tear production in a dog with keratoconjunctivitis sicca for a year  after inevitable nictitating membrane gland resection due to suspicion of a malignant tumour.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine and science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine and science</full-title></periodical><pages>2268-2272</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Conjunctivitis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Nictitating Membrane</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36049128</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vms3.919</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Since the removal of the NM causes KCS in dogs, it was contraindicated to remove  the NM unless unavoidable such as in a malignant tumour. However, to the best of author's knowledge, there are no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis owing to decreased tear production following removal of the NM gland. This case study demonstrates the tear production changes in a dog for a year after removal of the nictitating membrane (NM) due to suspicion of a malignant tumour. A 13-year-old spayed female English Cocker Spaniel who had suffered from severe ocular discharge, discomfort, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), and NM enlargement in the right eye was brought to our hospital. The dog could not tolerate treatment with topical 0.2% cyclosporine or corticosteroids. The dog's right eye had NM gland prolapse, severe follicular conjunctivitis and a very low Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1) value of 3 mm/min. Furthermore, the result of fine needle aspiration of the enlarged NM gland suggested a risk of malignancy. Despite the risk of KCS, complete NM resection was performed to diagnose the tumour. Fortunately, the final histopathological evaluation revealed chronic inflammation without any evidence of malignancy. Contrary to concerns that the STT-1 value would further decrease after the removal of the NM gland, the STT-1 value remained elevated compared to that before surgery, and the clinical symptoms improved for a year. It is generally known that NM gland resection is not recommended due to the risk of developing iatrogenic KCS unless a malignant tumour is suspected. In this case, surgical removal of the inflammatory NM gland that was not responsive to medications had a positive effect on KCS. Since the inflammatory and structural disease of the NM was strengthening KCS, the outcome was thought to be different from that when the normal third eyelid was removed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoshino, Tomoya</author><author>Fukuda, Shoko</author><author>Nagata, Masahiko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diode laser-assisted transcanal endoscopic removal of an aural polyp in the  external auditory canal of a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine and science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine and science</full-title></periodical><pages>1862-1866</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear</keyword><keyword>Ear Canal</keyword><keyword>Endoscopy</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lasers, Semiconductor</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polyps</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35594477</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vms3.845</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In humans, aural polyps comprise fibrovascular tissue covered by the  respiratory epithelium. Aural polyps with ciliated epithelium are common in cats but are rarely reported in dogs. In a previous case, a mass filled the tympanic cavity alone, and it was surgically removed. OBJECTIVES: To report a case of a canine aural polyp with ciliated epithelium extending from the dorsal tympanic cavity to the external auditory canal with detailed otological features and to demonstrate the usefulness of the transcanal endoscopic procedure (TEP) with a diode laser as a less-invasive therapy. METHODS: A 12-year-old castrated male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with a 6-month history of unilateral chronic otorrhoea. Video-otoscope examination revealed a protruding, reddish and soft-to-rubbery round mass in the right horizontal ear canal. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging further revealed a smooth mass extending from the dorsal portion of the tympanic cavity into the horizontal part of the external auditory canal. However, it showed no lesions in the dorsal tympanic cavity. RESULTS: The mass was removed using aural forceps by a traction-torsion manoeuvre. The suspected base of the mass on the caudal side of the upper tympanic cavity was confirmed by a rigid scope, and it was completely vaporised with a diode laser. Histopathology revealed foci of columnar ciliated epithelium embedded in the connective tissue encapsulated by stratified squamous epithelium. No recurrence was observed at 3 years and 8 months. CONCLUSION: We describe a rare case of an aural polyp with ciliated epithelium extending from the upper-middle ear to the external auditory canal in a dog. The TEP using a diode laser may be a useful minimally invasive treatment option for managing external auditory canal polyps.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kozáková, Eva</author><author>Bakštein, Eduard</author><author>Havlíček, Ondřej</author><author>Bečev, Ondřej</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disrupted Sense of Agency as a State Marker of First-Episode Schizophrenia: A  Large-Scale Follow-Up Study.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>570570</pages><volume>11</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33391045</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570570</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Background: Schizophrenia is often characterized by a general disruption of  self-processing and self-demarcation. Previous studies have shown that self-monitoring and sense of agency (SoA, i.e., the ability to recognize one's own actions correctly) are altered in schizophrenia patients. However, research findings are inconclusive in regards to how SoA alterations are linked to clinical symptoms and their severity, or cognitive factors. Methods: In a longitudinal study, we examined 161 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 154 controls with a continuous-report SoA task and a control task testing general cognitive/sensorimotor processes. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: In comparison to controls, patients performed worse in terms of recognition of self-produced movements even when controlling for confounding factors. Patients' SoA score correlated with the severity of PANSS-derived &quot;Disorganized&quot; symptoms and with a priori defined symptoms related to self-disturbances. In the follow-up, the changes in the two subscales were significantly associated with the change in SoA performance. Conclusion: We corroborated previous findings of altered SoA already in the early stage of schizophrenia. Decreased ability to recognize self-produced actions was associated with the severity of symptoms in two complementary domains: self-disturbances and disorganization. While the involvement of the former might indicate impairment in self-monitoring, the latter suggests the role of higher cognitive processes such as information updating or cognitive flexibility. The SoA alterations in schizophrenia are associated, at least partially, with the intensity of respective symptoms in a state-dependent manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Eun Wha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep dermal and subcutaneous canine hemangiosarcoma in the perianal area:  diagnosis of perianal mass in a dog.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>115</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Canal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hemangiosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30987633</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-019-1852-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Tumors of the perianal area occur frequently in dogs, and the two  most common tumors are perianal gland adenoma and anal sac adenocarcinoma; others such as mast cell tumor, lymphoma and melanoma can also occur at this site. Diagnostic cytology is a useful technique and is usually used to establish a definitive diagnosis of some tumors in veterinary medicine. This report describes an extremely rare case of a deep dermal and subcutaneous canine hemangiosarcoma in the perianal area. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old intact male spaniel was presented for evaluation of a 4 × 4 cm, ulcerated, and hemorrhagic mass presented in the right perianal region. In cytologic evaluation, malignant mesenchymal tumor with inflammation was diagnosed, and incidental heart worm microfilaremia was identified. Based on the cytologic evaluation, a punch biopsy (3 mm, three sites) was conducted under anesthesia and deep dermal and subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma (3 mitotic figures/10 high power field (400×)) was diagnosed by histopathological evaluation. It was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry results for cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and factor VIII-related antigen marker. CONCLUSIONS: Deep dermal and subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma in the perianal region is a rare condition, and its prognosis is usually poor. Perianal gland adenoma and anal sac adenocarcinoma are the two most common tumors in the perianal region, but other different types of tumors may also occur as in this case; therefore, accurate diagnosis is required using cytology and/or histopathological examination.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grützner, Niels</author><author>Suchodolski, Jan S</author><author>Steiner, Jörg M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship between cobalamin-dependent metabolites and both serum albumin and  alpha1 -proteinase inhibitor concentrations in hypocobalaminemic dogs of 7 different breeds.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>561-566</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Homocysteine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Methylmalonic Acid</keyword><keyword>Serum Albumin</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Vitamin B 12 Deficiency</keyword><keyword>alpha-Macroglobulins</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25331651</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12204</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Increased serum concentrations of homocysteine (HCY) and  methylmalonic acid (MMA), the 2 main cobalamin-dependent metabolites, as well as decreased serum albumin and canine alpha1 -proteinase inhibitor (cα1 -PI) concentrations have previously been described in hypocobalaminemic dogs with gastrointestinal disease. However, no studies have been conducted to evaluate potential relationships between these serum biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between HCY and MMA, 2 cobalamin-dependent metabolites, and both serum albumin and cα1 -PI concentrations in hypocobalaminemic dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from 285 dogs including 7 different breeds (Beagle, Boxer, Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, Chinese Shar-Pei, and Yorkshire Terrier) with hypocobalaminemia were used. Serum HCY, MMA, albumin, and cα1 -PI concentrations were determined. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between serum HCY and albumin concentrations, as well as serum HCY and cα1 -PI concentrations (ρ = 0.62 and ρ = 0.37, respectively; P &lt; .0001). No correlations were observed between serum MMA and albumin concentrations, or cα1 -PI concentrations (ρ = 0.01 and ρ = 0.08, respectively; P &gt; .05). In addition, significant breed-specific correlations were observed between serum MMA and albumin concentrations in German Shepherds, and serum HCY and MMA concentrations in Chinese Shar-Peis with hypocobalaminemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a correlation between serum albumin and cα1 -PI and HCY concentrations, but not with serum MMA concentration in dogs with hypocobalaminemia. In addition, significant breed-specific correlations were observed between serum MMA and albumin concentrations in German Shepherds, as well as serum HCY and MMA concentrations in Chinese Shar-Peis, emphasizing the unique metabolic interactions in those dog breeds affected by hypocobalaminemia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hong, Il-Hwa</author><author>Bae, Sun-Hee</author><author>Lee, Sang-Gwan</author><author>Park, Jin-Kyu</author><author>Ji, Ae-Ri</author><author>Ki, Mi-Ran</author><author>Han, Seon-Young</author><author>Lee, Eun-Mi</author><author>Kim, Ah-Young</author><author>You, Sang-Young</author><author>Kim, Tae-Hwan</author><author>Jeong, Kyu-Shik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the third eyelid conjunctiva in a  dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>61-65</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Conjunctiva</keyword><keyword>Conjunctival Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eyelids</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21199281</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2010.00843.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 4-year-old, neutered female Cocker Spaniel was presented to the veterinary  clinic for protrusion of the left third eyelid. When the third eyelids from both eyes were everted, lobulated masses were present on the bulbar surface. The left third eyelid had a larger protrusion. There was no apparent associated ocular or systemic involvement. The tumor of left third eyelid was removed and referred for histological examination. Histologically, there were proliferations of lymphoid follicles surrounded by lymphoid cells forming a marginal zone. Those lymphoid cells occasionally infiltrated into conjunctival epithelium. A few apoptotic bodies with karyopyknotic and karyorrhexic nuclei were observed in the germinal center of lymphoid follicles. Mitotic figures were rare. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells expressed CD79a but not CD3. A diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the third eyelid was established based on the histological and immunophenotypical features. At the 1-year follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence of the mass at the area of excision of the left third eyelid and the remaining tumor of the right third eyelid was still a similar size. The dog still showed no significant findings, except those of the tumor, and no evidence of systemic involvement. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of MALT lymphoma of the third eyelid in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schrope, Donald P</author><author>Kelch, William J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Signalment, clinical signs, and prognostic indicators associated with high-grade  second- or third-degree atrioventricular block in dogs: 124 cases (January 1, 1997-December 31, 1997).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1710-1717</pages><volume>228</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Death, Sudden</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Block</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pacemaker, Artificial</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16740072</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.228.11.1710</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate signalment, clinical signs, and prognosis associated with  high-grade second- or third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 124 dogs. PROCEDURES: Data were gathered from ECGs, veterinarian questionnaires, echocardiograms, and radiographs submitted for review; compared with data from a large control group; and examined for association between variables and duration of survival. A new classification system for AVB was evaluated. RESULTS: Afghan, Catahoula Leopard Dog, Chow Chow, Cocker Spaniel, German Wirehaired Pointer, and Labrador Retriever breeds were predisposed to high-grade second- or third-degree AVB. Heavier, older, and sexually intact female dogs were overrepresented in the study group. Weakness, lethargy, exercise intolerance, and syncope were the most common clinical signs. The presence of clinical signs was not associated with duration of survival. Dogs with high-grade second-degree AVB had a duration of survival similar to that of dogs with third-degree AVB. Dogs with high-grade second- or third-degree AVB were at high risk for sudden death in the first 6 months after diagnosis. High ventricular escape rhythm rate and narrow escape-complex QRS width were negatively associated with duration of survival. Pacemaker implantation had a significant positive association with survival. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pacemaker implantation should be strongly considered in all dogs with high-grade second- or third-degree AVB regardless of whether clinical signs are evident. If medical treatment is warranted, vagolytic medications may be the best choice. A new classification system for AVB may merit further investigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kiviranta, A-M</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Laitinen-Vapaavuori, O</author><author>Hielm-Björkman, A</author><author>Lappalainen, A K</author><author>Knowler, S P</author><author>Jokinen, T S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syringomyelia and Craniocervical Junction Abnormalities in Chihuahuas.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1771-1781</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Occipital Joint</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medulla Oblongata</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Compression</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28892202</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14826</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) are widely  reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Griffon Bruxellois dogs. Increasing evidence indicates that CM and SM also occur in other small and toy breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas. OBJECTIVES: To describe the presence of SM and craniocervical junction (CCJ) abnormalities in Chihuahuas and to evaluate the possible association of CCJ abnormalities with SM. To describe CM/SM-related clinical signs and neurologic deficits and to investigate the association of CM/SM-related clinical signs with signalment, SM, or CCJ abnormalities. ANIMALS: Fifty-three client-owned Chihuahuas. METHODS: Prospective study. Questionnaire analyses and physical and neurologic examinations were obtained before magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging. Images were evaluated for the presence of SM, CM, and atlantooccipital overlapping. Additionally, medullary kinking, dorsal spinal cord compression, and their sum indices were calculated. RESULTS: Scratching was the most common CM/SM-related clinical sign and decreased postural reaction the most common neurologic deficit in 73 and 87% of dogs, respectively. Chiari-like malformation and SM were present in 100 and 38% of dogs, respectively. Syringomyelia was associated with the presence of CM/SM-related clinical signs (P = 0.034), and medullary kinking and sum indices were higher in dogs with clinical signs (P = 0.016 and P = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Syringomyelia and CCJ abnormalities are prevalent in Chihuahuas. Syringomyelia was an important factor for the presence of CM/SM-related clinical signs, but many dogs suffered from similar clinical signs without being affected by SM, highlighting the clinical importance of CCJ abnormalities in Chihuahuas.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor-Brown, Frances E</author><author>Meeson, Richard L</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>McGreevy, Paul D</author><author>Thomson, Peter C</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiology of Cranial Cruciate Ligament Disease Diagnosis in Dogs Attending  Primary-Care Veterinary Practices in England.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>777-783</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Insurance Coverage</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Ovariectomy</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26118493</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vsu.12349</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors for a diagnosis of cranial  cruciate ligament (CCL) disease in dogs and to describe the management of such cases attending primary-care veterinary practices. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort with a nested case-control study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Nine hundred and fifty-three dogs diagnosed with CCL disease from 171,522 dogs attending 97 primary-care practices in England. METHODS: Medical records of dogs attending practices participating in the VetCompass project that met selection criteria were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to evaluate association of possible risk factors with diagnosis of CCL disease. RESULTS: The prevalence of CCL disease diagnosis was estimated at 0.56% (95% confidence interval 0.52-0.59). Compared with crossbred dogs, Rottweilers, West Highland White Terriers, Golden Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, and Staffordshire Bull Terriers showed increased odds of CCL disease diagnosis while Cocker Spaniels showed reduced odds. Increasing bodyweight within breeds was associated with increased odds of diagnosis. Dogs aged over 3 years had increased odds of diagnosis compared with dogs aged less than 3 years. Neutered females had 2.1 times the odds of diagnosis compared with entire females. Insured dogs had 4 times the odds of diagnosis compared with uninsured dogs. Two-thirds of cases were managed surgically, with insured and heavier dogs more frequently undergoing surgery. Overall, 21% of cases were referred, with referral more frequent in heavier and insured dogs. Referred dogs more frequently had surgery and an osteotomy procedure. CONCLUSION: Breed predispositions and demographic factors associated with diagnosis and case management of CCL disease in dogs identified in this study can be used to help direct future research and management strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Karlberg, B E</author><author>Vuolteenaho, O</author><author>Olsson, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of naturally acquired decompensated mitral valve regurgitation on the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in dogs.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>77-82</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aldosterone</keyword><keyword>Angiotensin II</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrial Natriuretic Factor</keyword><keyword>Blood Pressure</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Hematocrit</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>Renin-Angiotensin System</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>8989501</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To investigate activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  and N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) during development of clinical signs of decompensated mitral valve regurgitation (MR). ANIMALS: 11 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with advanced MR attributable to chronic valvular disease. PROCEDURE: Dogs were subjected to repeated examinations at 6-month intervals until signs of decompensation had developed (end point). Data acquired at end point were compared with data obtained from examinations 1 year and 1 to 6 months before decompensation. Each examination included physical examination, collection of venous blood, thoracic radiography, and echocardiography. RESULTS: Echocardiographic measurements of left atrial-to-aortic root ratio and left ventricular end diastolic diameter increased considerably during the study, whereas left ventricular end systolic diameter remained unchanged. The increase in cardiac size was associated with increased plasma concentration of NT-proANP. In contrast, plasma concentrations of aldosterone and angiotensin II were reduced at decompensation (aldosterone compared with the 2 earlier examinations and angiotensin II compared with values obtained 1 to 6 months before), despite decreased plasma protein concentration and hematocrit, suggesting fluid retention. The urine-to-plasma creatinine ratio was reduced at end point. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Early decompensated MR in dogs was not associated with increased circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity, which may be caused by increased activity of ANP, and may be important for future therapeutic strategies of MR.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jondeau, C</author><author>Gounon, M</author><author>Bourguet, A</author><author>Chahory, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiology and clinical significance of canine distichiasis: A retrospective  study of 291 cases.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>37028946</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.13091</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological factors and clinical significance of  canine distichiasis. ANIMALS STUDIED: Two hundred and ninety-one client-owned dogs. METHODS: Retrospective study of medical records for canine patients diagnosed with distichiasis between 2010 and 2019 in an ophthalmology specialty practice. The breed, sex, skull conformation, coat type, age at the time of diagnosis, reason for presentation, clinical examination findings, and affected eyelid(s) were reviewed. RESULTS: The prevalence of distichiasis was 5.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.9-6.1) in the population of dogs presented to an ophthalmology specialty practice. The breeds with the highest prevalence were English bulldogs (35.2%, 95% CI: 26.7-43.7) and American cocker spaniels (19.4%, 95% CI: 8.3-30.5). The prevalence was significantly higher in brachycephalic dogs (11.9%, 95% CI: 9.8-14.0) than in non-brachycephalic dogs (4.6%, 95% CI: 4.0-5.3) and in short-haired dogs (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.8-9.6) than in dogs with other coat types (5.3%, 95% CI: 4.5-6.1). Most dogs were affected bilaterally (63.6%, 95% CI: 58.0-69.1). Among dogs with clinical signs, 39.0% (95% CI: 26.5-51.4) exhibited corneal ulceration, including superficial ulcers (28.8%, 95% CI: 17.3-40.4) and deep stromal ulcers (10.2%, 95% CI: 2.5-17.8). Distichiasis was non-irritating in 85.0% (95% CI: 80.6-89.4) of affected dogs. CONCLUSION: This study reports the largest cohort of canine distichiasis to date. In a large proportion of dogs, distichiasis was a non-irritating condition. However, brachycephalic breeds, especially English bulldogs, were the most frequently and severely affected.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shoop-Worrall, Stephanie Jw</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Viscasillas, Jaime</author><author>Brodbelt, David C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mortality related to general anaesthesia and sedation in dogs under UK primary  veterinary care.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</full-title></periodical><pages>433-442</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Anesthesia, General</keyword><keyword>Anesthetics, General</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hypnotics and Sedatives</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35985925</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaa.2022.03.006</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To quantify and explore risk factors in dogs seen at primary care UK  veterinary clinics for general anaesthetic (GA)/sedative-related death overall, in addition to neuter-specific procedures. STUDY DESIGN: A nested case-control study within UK primary care veterinary electronic patient record surveillance programme, VetCompass, including over 300 UK veterinary practices. ANIMALS: A total of 157,318 dogs undergoing GA/sedative events. METHODS: Cases included dogs undergoing GA/sedative events between January 2010 and December 2013 with GA/sedative-related death recorded within 48 hours or 2 weeks of the event. Controls were randomly selected from dogs undergoing GA/sedation that did not die within these time periods. Risks of GA/sedative-related death for all surgeries and neuter-specific surgeries were estimated. Demographic and clinical associations with GA/sedative-related death were reported as odds ratios following multivariable logistic regression modelling. Statistical significance was set at 5%. RESULTS: From 157,318 dogs with a GA/sedative event, there were 159 (0.10%) within 48 hours and 219 (0.14%) GA/sedative-related deaths within 2 weeks. Within 89,852 dogs that underwent a neuter surgery, there were eight GA/sedative related (0.009%). Greater age, poorer American Society of Anaesthesiologists health status scores and more urgent procedures were associated with greater odds of death. Compared with mixed breeds, Rottweilers and West Highland White Terriers had greater odds and Cocker Spaniels had lower odds of GA/sedative-related death. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The overall risk for GA/sedative related death was relatively low, particularly among the subset of dogs undergoing castration or ovariohysterectomy surgery. Associations and risk estimates may assist shared decision-making in clinical practice and provide benchmarks for audit.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moesgaard, Sophia Gry</author><author>Pedersen, Lotte Gam</author><author>Teerlink, Tom</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik Duelund</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neurohormonal and circulatory effects of short-term treatment with enalapril and  quinapril in dogs with asymptomatic mitral regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>712-719</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arginine</keyword><keyword>Cross-Over Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Enalapril</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Natriuretic Agents</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Quinapril</keyword><keyword>Renin</keyword><keyword>Tetrahydroisoquinolines</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16231716</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The aim of the study was to compare the effect of 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors on neurohormonal and circulatory variables in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) with asymptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR). Ten CKCSs with mild to severe untreated MR were treated with 2 ACE inhibitors, quinapril and enalapril (each at 0.5 mg/kg PO q24h for 7 days), in a double-blind, crossover study with a washout period of 7 days between treatments. Blood samples were drawn and echocardiography was performed on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Both treatments reduced ACE activity (P &lt; .001) and increased renin activity (P &lt; .001) and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration (P &lt; .005). The ACE inhibitors had no effect on the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite (NOx) or asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). On day 0, a lower NOx concentration (P = .02) was found in samples taken in the clinic as compared to samples taken in the homes of the dogs. Quinapril caused a significant reduction in more variables that reflect the severity of MR (eg, jet size and left ventricular end diastolic diameter) than did enalapril. However, in terms of specific variables, no significant difference was identified between the effects of the 2 treatments on MR. These results suggest that ACE inhibitors do not affect NOx and ADMA concentrations in asymptomatic dogs, but exercise, stress, or some combination may influence NOx concentrations in these dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fuentes, Virginia Luis</author><author>Corcoran, Brendan</author><author>French, Anne</author><author>Schober, Karsten E</author><author>Kleemann, Rainer</author><author>Justus, Claus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of pimobendan in dogs with  dilated cardiomyopathy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>255-261</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</keyword><keyword>Cardiotonic Agents</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Pyridazines</keyword><keyword>Survival</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12041654</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2002)016&lt;0255:adrpso&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to examine the  effect on heart failure class and survival of pimobendan, an oral calcium-sensitizing inodilator, in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Pimobendan (0.3-0.6 mg/kg body weight/d) or placebo was administered to English Cocker Spaniels (CSs; n = 10) and Doberman Pinschers (DPs: n = 10) that had DCM in addition to background therapy of furosemide, enalapril, and digoxin. Addition of pimobendan to standard triple therapy was associated with a significant improvement in heart failure class, regardless of breed (P &lt; .02, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). Overall, 8 of 10 animals in the pimobendan-treated group, and 1 of 10 animals in the placebo group improved their heart failure status by at least I modified New York Heart Association functional class after initial stabilization (P = .005, Fisher's exact test). Pimobendan had no significant effect on survival in the CSs (P = 0.77, log-rank test), but DPs treated with pimobendan had significantly longer survival times compared with placebo (P &lt; .02, log-rank test), with a median survival time of 329 days in the pimobendan group compared with 50 days in the placebo group, and a hazard ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.4-39.8). Pimobendan resulted in significant improvement in heart failure class when added to standard therapy in this group of dogs with DCM, and may have contributed to improved survival in DPs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoon, Hakyoung</author><author>Han, Sung-Hee</author><author>Kim, Jaehwan</author><author>Kim, Kihoon</author><author>Eom, Kidong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urogenital anomalies and urinary incontinence in an English Cocker Spaniel dog  with XX sex reversal.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1166-1171</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>46, XX Testicular Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Clitoris</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epididymis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>Urinary Incontinence</keyword><keyword>Urogenital Abnormalities</keyword><keyword>Uterus</keyword><keyword>Vulva</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29572943</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15119</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-year-old dog weighing 8 kg was referred with a disorder of sexual development  and persistent urinary incontinence before and after gonadohysterectomy performed at a local animal hospital. Histopathological examination disclosed hypoplasia of the testes, epididymis, pampiniform plexus, and uterus. On ultrasonography, an anomalous structure containing anechoic fluid was identified in the region dorsal to the urinary bladder. An anomalous communication between the proximal urethra and the remnant uterus and vagina was found on retrograde urethrography under fluoroscopy. Reflux of contrast medium into the anomalous structure, suspected to be the uterus and cranial vagina, from the urethra was detected. Computed tomography identified the anomalous structure between the rectum and urethra. The anomalous structure was removed via laparotomy and the urinary incontinence resolved.

Previously, using a broad metabolite fingerprinting approach, lipids appear to dominate inter- and intra- breed discrimination. The purpose here was to use Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) to identify in more detail, inter-breed signatures in plasma lipidomic profiles of home-based, client-owned dogs maintained on different diets and fed according to their owners' feeding regimens. METHODS: Nine dog breeds were recruited in this study (Beagle, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, Dachshund, Golden Retriever, Greyhound, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Maltese: 7-12 dogs per breed). Metabolite profiling on a MTBE lipid extract of fasted plasma was performed using UHPLC-HRMS. RESULTS: Multivariate modelling and classification indicated that the main source of lipidome variance was between the three breeds Chihuahua, Dachshund and Greyhound and the other six breeds, however some intra-breed variance was evident in Labrador Retrievers. Metabolites associated with dietary intake impacted on breed-associated variance and following filtering of these signals out of the data-set unique inter-breed lipidome differences for Chihuahua, Golden Retriever and Greyhound were identified. CONCLUSION: By using a phenotypically diverse home-based canine population, we were able to show that high accurate mass lipidomics can enable identification of metabolites in the first pass plasma profile, capturing distinct metabolomic variability associated with genetic differences, despite environmental and dietary variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Suter, Steven E</author><author>Hamilton, Matthew J</author><author>Sullivan, Edmund W</author><author>Venkataraman, Gopalakrishnan M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in a dog with acute large granular  lymphocytic leukemia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>994-997</pages><volume>246</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25875671</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.246.9.994</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 3-year-old 10-kg (22-lb) neutered male Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel was referred because of an episode of acute vomiting and diarrhea. CLINICAL FINDINGS: On physical examination, mild splenomegaly and prominent submandibular and popliteal lymph nodes were detected. Complete blood cell count revealed a high WBC count, characterized by a moderate lymphocytosis with 62% unclassified cells and severe thrombocytopenia with macroplatelets. On cytologic evaluation, the unclassified cells were described as large, neoplastic lymphoid cells containing a large nucleus with lacy chromatin and a large amount of blue vacuolated cytoplasm containing sparse, very fine azurophilic granules. A diagnosis of acute large granular lymphocytic leukemia of splenic origin was made. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Following induction chemotherapy, the affected dog underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with dog leukocyte antigen-matched CD34+ cells harvested from a sibling of the same litter. Chimerism analysis revealed full donor engraftment within 2 weeks after transplantation that remained stable for at least 2 years, with the dog remaining apparently healthy at home. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Acute leukemias in dogs are rapidly fatal diseases. If an appropriate donor can be located, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation may offer a feasible treatment, although peripheral blood CD34+ cell harvesting requires the availability of cell separator machines and management of graft-versus-host disease with immunosuppressive agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dedola, Carla</author><author>Stuart, Alasdair P G</author><author>Ridyard, Alison E</author><author>Else, Roderick W</author><author>van den Broek, Adri H M</author><author>Choi, Jong Soo</author><author>de Hoog, G Sybren</author><author>Thoday, Keith L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cutaneous Alternaria infectoria infection in a dog in association with  therapeutic immunosuppression for the management of immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>626-634</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Alternaria</keyword><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermatomycoses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20500496</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-3164.2009.00875.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 4-year-old, ovariohysterectomized, English springer spaniel on  immunosuppressive therapy was re-examined for the review of its immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and the recent development of skin lesions. For the 3 months since hospital discharge, the dog had been receiving 1.3 mg/kg prednisolone and 2.6 mg/kg ciclosporin, both administered orally twice daily. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and multiple, purulent, crusting, erosive to ulcerative lesions over different body areas. Onychorrhexis had occurred on one digit and the underlying corium had blackened. There were two proliferative and one plaque-like lesions in the mouth. Thick walled fungal hyphae were detected in impression smears from all skin lesions and staining with periodic acid-Schiff's stain confirmed the presence of multiple fungal hyphae and spores in all biopsies examined. Fungal culture isolated a heavy, pure growth of an Alternaria sp. which was identified as A. infectoria by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the rRNA gene. The animal's condition prevented detailed investigation of the oral lesions. Withdrawal of the ciclosporin and reduction of the prednisolone dosage resulted in spontaneous resolution of the skin lesions within 40 days. Further gradual decrements in the prednisolone dosage to zero were carried out without recurrence of the immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. After 12 months, there has been no recurrence of either the skin lesions or the anaemia. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of A. infectoria infection in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pastor, M</author><author>Chalvet-Monfray, K</author><author>Marchal, T</author><author>Keck, G</author><author>Magnol, J P</author><author>Fournel-Fleury, C</author><author>Ponce, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic and environmental risk indicators in canine non-Hodgkin's lymphomas:  breed associations and geographic distribution of 608 cases diagnosed throughout France over 1 year.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>301-310</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>France</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunophenotyping</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, T-Cell</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19192140</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0255.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The etiology of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) is multifactorial.  Environmental and genetic factors are frequently incriminated both in humans and dogs. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to study the geographic distribution of canine NHL (CNHL) in France and to evaluate genetic and environmental influences. ANIMALS: Six hundred and eight cases of CNHL, diagnosed throughout France over 1 year, were collected from 7 Veterinary Histopathologic Laboratories. METHODS: Retrospective study. Breeds affected by lymphomas were compared with the national population and associations between breed and immunophenotype were studied. The distribution of CNHL and canine T-cell NHL per 100,000 dogs per department was compared with the distribution of waste incinerators, polluted sites, and radioactive waste. RESULTS: The breeds significantly overrepresented among lymphoma cases were Boxer, Setter, and Cocker Spaniel (P &lt; .001). There was a significant association between Boxer and T-cell NHL (P &lt; .001), and between German Shepherd and Rottweiler and B-cell NHL (P &lt; .01). The geographic distribution of CNHL and canine T-cell NHL indicated significant heterogeneity. Significant association between distributions of CNHL and waste incinerators (rho= 0.25, P &lt; .05), polluted sites (rho= 0.36, P &lt; .001), and radioactive waste (rho= 0.51, P &lt; .001) was found. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Influence of genetics in the development of CNHL was supported by the existence of an association between breed and immunophenotype. Waste incinerators, polluted sites, and radioactive waste could just be considered as risk indicators of CNHL, but not as risk factors. Case-control studies around critical sites are necessary to confirm the implication of those environmental factors in the development of CNHL.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Short, Andrea D</author><author>Catchpole, Brian</author><author>Kennedy, Lorna J</author><author>Barnes, Annette</author><author>Fretwell, Neale</author><author>Jones, Chris</author><author>Thomson, Wendy</author><author>Ollier, William E R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of candidate susceptibility genes in canine diabetes.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>518-525</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17611256</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/esm048</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine diabetes is a complex genetic disease of unknown aetiology. It affects  0.005-1.5% of the canine population and shows a clear breed predisposition with the Samoyed being at high risk and the Boxer being at low risk of developing the disease. Canine diabetes is considered to be a disease homologue for human type 1 diabetes (T1D). It results in insulin deficiency as a consequence of autoimmune destruction of islet beta-cells in the pancreas and is believed to be mediated by Th1 cytokines (IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL-2). A number of genes have been associated with type 1 diabetes in humans, including the human leukocyte antigen region, the insulin variable number tandem repeat, PTPN22, CTLA4, IL-4, and IL-13. As yet, these genes have not been evaluated in canine diabetes. In this study, 483 cases of canine diabetes and 869 controls of known breed were analyzed for association with IFNgamma, IGF2, IL-10, IL-12beta, IL-6, insulin, PTPN22, RANTES, IL-4, IL-1alpha and TNFalpha. Minor allele frequencies were determined for these genes in each breed. These data were used for comparative analyses in a case-control study, and clear associations with diabetes were identified in some breeds with certain alleles of candidate genes. Some associations were with increased susceptibility to the disease (IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-12beta, IL-6, insulin, PTPN22, IL-4, and TNFalpha), whereas others were protective (IL-4, PTPN22, IL-6, insulin, IGF2, TNFalpha). This study demonstrates that a number of the candidate genes previously associated with human T1D also appear to be associated with canine diabetes and identifies an IL-10 haplotype which is associated with diabetes in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. This suggests that canine diabetes is an excellent comparative and spontaneously occurring disease model of human T1D.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaye, E M</author><author>Alroy, J</author><author>Raghavan, S S</author><author>Schwarting, G A</author><author>Adelman, L S</author><author>Runge, V</author><author>Gelblum, D</author><author>Thalhammer, J G</author><author>Zuniga, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dysmyelinogenesis in animal model of GM1 gangliosidosis.</title><secondary-title>Pediatric neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pediatric neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>255-261</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Diseases, Metabolic</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Demyelinating Diseases</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gangliosidosis, GM1</keyword><keyword>Glycosphingolipids</keyword><keyword>Lysosomal Storage Diseases</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Myelin Sheath</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1388413</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0887-8994(92)90361-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pathologic examinations, and biochemical  analyses were performed on 2 different canine mutants with GM1 gangliosidosis (i.e., English Springer Spaniel and Portuguese Water Dog) and on age- and sex-matched controls. Serial MRI studies were also performed on a child with infantile-onset GM1 gangliosidosis. The affected dogs had abnormalities on MRI, including a relative increase in gray matter and an abnormal signal intensity of cerebral and cerebellar white matter observed on T2-weighted MRI. White matter changes on MRI were similar to white matter abnormalities observed in a 15-month-old boy with GM1 gangliosidosis. The weight ratio of white to gray matter from the frontal lobe was markedly reduced. Microscopic examination revealed characteristic ballooned neurons which stained lightly with Luxol-fast blue. The central cerebral and cerebellar folia white matter exhibited pallor and gliosis, while the corpus callosum and fornix stained normally with Luxol-fast blue. Axons appeared intact on Bodian staining. Ultrastructural studies revealed fewer myelinated axons in affected puppies. Total gangliosides in gray matter were elevated. Thin-layer chromatography demonstrated GM1 ganglioside as the predominant ganglioside. The amount of cerebrosides and sulfatides was reduced in the gray and white matter when compared to controls but the ratio in gray and white matter remained unchanged. Immunostaining of neutral glycolipids disclosed increased amounts of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 glycolipid in gray matter. These findings suggest that canine models for GM1 gangliosidosis are associated with abnormal myelin development which may be similar to the human disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Höglund, K</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Hanås, S</author><author>Merveille, A-C</author><author>Gouni, V</author><author>Wiberg, M</author><author>Lundgren Willesen, J</author><author>Entee, K Mc</author><author>Mejer Sørensen, L</author><author>Tiret, L</author><author>Seppälä, E H</author><author>Lohi, H</author><author>Chetboul, V</author><author>Fredholm, M</author><author>Lequarré, A-S</author><author>Ljungvall, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interbreed variation in serum serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) concentration in  healthy dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>244-253</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Serotonin</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Specimen Handling</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29921518</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2018.05.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) has several biological  functions. In different species, excessive 5-HT has been linked to valvular lesions, similar to those seen in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease. Previous studies suggest higher 5-HT in healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs), a breed highly affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease, compared to other breeds. OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential interbreed variation in serum 5-HT in healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 483 healthy dogs of nine breeds aged 1-7 years. METHODS: Dogs were examined at five European centers. Absence of cardiovascular, organ-related, or systemic diseases was ensured by thorough clinical investigations including echocardiography. Serum was frozen and later analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Median 5-HT concentration was 252.5 (interquartile range = 145.5-390.6) ng/mL. Overall breed difference was found (p&lt;0.0001), and 42% of pairwise breed comparisons were significant. Univariate regression analysis showed association between serum 5-HT concentration and breed, center of examination, storage time, and sex, with higher 5-HT in females. In multiple regression analysis, the final model had an adjusted R(2) of 0.27 with breed (p&lt;0.0001), center (p&lt;0.0001), and storage time (p=0.014) remaining significant. Within centers, overall breed differences were found at 3/5 centers (p≤0.028), and pairwise comparisons within those centers showed breed differences in 42% of comparisons. Among the included breeds, Newfoundlands, Belgian Shepherds and CKCSs had highest 5-HT concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Interbreed variation in serum 5-HT concentration was found in healthy dogs aged 1-7 years. These differences should be taken into account when designing clinical studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Höglund, K</author><author>Lequarré, A-S</author><author>Ljungvall, I</author><author>Mc Entee, K</author><author>Merveille, A-C</author><author>Wiberg, M</author><author>Gouni, V</author><author>Lundgren Willesen, J</author><author>Hanås, S</author><author>Wess, G</author><author>Mejer Sørensen, L</author><author>Tiret, L</author><author>Kierczak, M</author><author>Forsberg, S K G</author><author>Seppälä, E</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, K</author><author>Lohi, H</author><author>Chetboul, V</author><author>Fredholm, M</author><author>Häggström, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of Breed on Plasma Endothelin-1 Concentration, Plasma Renin Activity, and  Serum Cortisol Concentration in Healthy Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>566-573</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endothelin-1</keyword><keyword>Europe</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hydrocortisone</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Renin</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26812988</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.13829</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: There are breed differences in several blood variables in healthy  dogs. OBJECTIVE: Investigate breed variation in plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentration, plasma renin activity, and serum cortisol concentration. ANIMALS: Five-hundred and thirty-one healthy dogs of 9 breeds examined at 5 centers (2-4 breeds/center). METHODS: Prospective observational study. Circulating concentrations of ET-1 and cortisol, and renin activity, were measured using commercially available assays. Absence of organ-related or systemic disease was ensured by thorough clinical investigations, including blood pressure measurement, echocardiography, ECG, blood and urine analysis. RESULTS: Median ET-1 concentration was 1.29 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.97-1.82) pg/mL, median cortisol concentration 46.0 (IQR, 29.0-80.8) nmol/L, and median renin activity 0.73 (IQR, 0.48-1.10) ng/mL/h in all dogs. Overall, breed differences were found in ET-1 and cortisol concentrations, and renin activity (P &lt; .0001 for all). Pair-wise comparisons between breeds differed in 67% of comparisons for ET-1, 22% for cortisol, and 19% for renin activity, respectively. Within centers, breed differences were found at 5/5 centers for ET-1, 4/5 centers for cortisol, and 2/5 centers for renin activity. Newfoundlands had highest median ET-1 concentration, 3 times higher than Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Doberman Pinschers, and Dachshunds. Median renin activity was highest in Dachshunds, twice the median value in Newfoundlands and Boxers. Median cortisol concentration was highest in Finnish Lapphunds, almost 3 times higher than in Boxers.

HYPOTHESIS: A diet formulated to contain a high content of both protein and fiber is more satiating than diets that contain only high fiber or high protein. ANIMALS: Six entire female adult dogs (2 Shetland Sheepdogs, 2 Brittany Spaniels, 2 Labrador Retrievers) participated in the satiety studies; 105 adult female dogs of various breeds and ages were used for the palatability studies. METHODS: Three diets (high protein [103 g/1,000 kcal] high fiber [60 g/1,000 kcal] [HPHF]; high protein [104 g/1,000 kcal] moderate fiber [35 g/1,000 kcal] [HP]; moderate protein [86 g/1,000 kcal] high fiber [87 g/1,000 kcal] [HF]) were tested. Voluntary food intake was measured in 5 sequential crossover studies, and palatability was assessed with food preference tests. RESULTS: Protein digestibility was significantly lower for HF (mean +/- SD; 77.7% +/- 2.52%) than for both HPHF (81.1% +/- 0.96%) and HP (81.1% +/- 1.65%) (P &lt; .001). Short-term food intake (food ingested when offered for 15 minutes every hour for 4 hours) was lower for HPHF than for both HP and HF (P = .038). Medium-term intake (food ingested when offered 3 hours after first meal) was lower for both HPHF (27 +/- 22.2 kcal/kg(0.73)) and HF (41 +/- 6.8 kcal/kg(0.73)) than for HP (57 +/- 18.8 kcal/kg(0.73)) (P = .041). Voluntary food intake 3 hours after feeding a restricted meal (25% daily maintenance energy requirements) was significantly lower on the HPHF diet than on either the HP (-51%, P = .0051) or HF (-47%, P = .014) diets. However, there was no significant difference between the energy intake on the HP and HF diets (7%, P = .37). The HPHF and HP diets had equivalent palatability, and both were more palatable than the HF diet (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The HPHF diet had a satiating effect as evidenced by reduced voluntary intake compared with HP and HF diets, and has the potential to lead to greater compliance in weight-loss programs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Franklin, Chantelle</author><author>Herrtage, Michael</author><author>Harris, Karen</author><author>Genain, Marie-Aude</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of incidental humeral intracondylar fissures in brachycephalic breed  dogs in CT studies.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>194-200</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36478490</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.13191</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Humeral intracondylar fissures (HIF) have been predominantly reported in spaniel  breeds and proposed to be possible risk factors for humeral condyle fractures (HCF). We hypothesized that the prevalence of incidental HIF in French Bulldogs may be greater than that of other brachycephalic breeds. A retrospective, observational, prevalence study was performed using CT examinations of French bulldogs and other brachycephalic breed dogs presenting for an unrelated condition. Two European College of Veterinary Diagnostic and Imaging-certified radiologists reviewed the images of the humeral condyles of these dogs. A classification system was devised to grade the findings. We considered a Score 1 to be normal, Score 2 to have centralised sclerosis, Score 3 to have a partial fissure and Score 4 to have a complete fissure. A total of 228 elbows were reviewed from 122 dogs. Of this population, 145 elbows were from French Bulldogs, 54 were from Pugs, and the remainder were from a mix of other brachycephalic breeds. The prevalence of HIF (score 3 or 4) in elbows of the French bulldog, pug and other breed groups was 6.9% (CI 2.8-11%), 5.6% (CI 0-11.7%), and 3.4% (CI 0-10.15%), respectively. At a dog level, the prevalence of HIF (score 3 or 4 present in at least one elbow) was found to be 11.8% (CI 4.6-19%) in French Bulldogs, 11.1% (CI 0-22.9%) in Pugs, and 5.26% (CI 0-15%) in the other breed group. There was no significant difference between the breed groups. The inter-reviewer reliability for CT scoring of HIF based on Cohen's weighted kappa was low at 0.19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soussa, R W</author><author>Woodward, A</author><author>Marty, M</author><author>Cannon, C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed is associated with the ABCB1-1Δ mutation in Australian dogs.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>79-83</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31743433</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.12896</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a cellular membrane  pump. One functional mutation that leads to expression of a less functional form of P-gp, ABCB1-1Δ, has been described in dogs. Individuals with this mutation can have severe adverse reactions to common veterinary pharmaceuticals that are known substrates of this pump. We investigated the detection of this mutation in samples submitted to two Australian diagnostic laboratories. METHODS: A total of 4842 dogs across 27 breeds were tested for the ABCB1-1Δ mutation from buccal swabs or EDTA blood using standard PCR, multiplex PCR, or genotyping chip. Statistical analysis was applied to determine the proportions and odds ratios of the ABCB1-1Δ mutation in herding breeds compared with non-herding breeds. RESULTS: The ABCB1-1Δ mutation was detected in nine breeds. The most commonly affected breeds were collies, Australian shepherds, white Swiss shepherds, and Shetland sheepdogs. Of 32 dogs in 18 non-herding breeds tested, one cocker spaniel and one labradoodle were positive for the mutation, both heterozygous. CONCLUSION: The most frequently affected breeds for ABCB1-1Δ mutation are the collie, Australian shepherd, white Swiss shepherd and Shetland sheepdog. As the mutation is associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions to commonly used pharmaceuticals, veterinarians need to be aware of the breeds at most risk of carrying this mutation and consider testing these individuals prior to administering these medications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Runte, M</author><author>Dekomien, G</author><author>Epplen, J T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of RDS/Peripherin and ROM1 as candidate genes in generalised  progressive retinal atrophy and exclusion of digenic inheritance.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>223-227</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Substitution</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Intermediate Filament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins</keyword><keyword>Peripherins</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10895316</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2052.2000.00633.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Generalised progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA) is a heterogeneous group of  hereditary diseases causing degeneration of the retina in dogs and cats. As a combination of mutations in the RDS/Peripherin and the ROM1 genes leads to the phenotype of retinitis pigmentosa in man we first performed mutation analysis to screen these genes for disease causing mutations followed by the investigation of a digenic inheritance in dogs. We cloned the RDS/Peripherin gene and investigated the RDS/Peripherin and ROM1 genes for disease causing mutations in 13 gPRA-affected dog breeds including healthy animals, obligate gPRA carriers and gPRA-affected dogs. We screened for mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Sequence analysis revealed several sequence variations. In the coding region of the RDS/Peripherin gene three nucleotide exchanges were identified (A277C; C316T; G1255A), one of which leads to an amino acid substitution (Ala339Thr). Various silent sequence variations were found in the coding region of the ROM1 gene (A536G, G1006A, T1018C, T1111C, C1150T, C1195T), as well as an amino acid substitution (G252T; Ala54Ser). By excluding the respective gene as a cause for gPRA several sequence variations in the intronic regions were investigated. None of these sequence variations cosegregated with autosomal recessively (ar) transmitted gPRA in 11 breeds. The candidate gene RDS/Peripherin obviously does not harbour the critical mutation causing the autosomal recessive form of gPRA because diseased individuals show heterozygous genotypes for sequence variations in the Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog, Cocker Spaniel, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Entlebucher Sennenhund, Sloughi, Yorkshire Terrier, Tibet Mastiff, Tibet Terrier and Labrador Retriever breeds. In the following breeds the ROM1 gene was also excluded indirectly for gPRA: Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog, Sloughi, Collie, Tibet Terrier, Labrador Retriever and Saarloos/Wolfhound. Digenic inheritance for gPRA is practically excluded for both these genes in four breeds: Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Labrador Retriever and Saarloos/Wolfhound.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hall, Georgina B F</author><author>Schwarz, Tobias</author><author>Liuti, Tiziana</author><author>Salgado, Jorge P A</author><author>Ferreira, Marisa F</author><author>Willems, Annelies L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arterial malformations leading to bilateral spontaneous renal hemorrhage in a  dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)</full-title></periodical><pages>267-273</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hemoperitoneum</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35080123</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vec.13114</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging, management,  and follow-up of a dog that presented with sequential, bilateral, spontaneous, subcapsular and perirenal hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) due to bilateral renal arterial malformations. CASE SUMMARY: A 9-year-old intact male Field Spaniel presented for acute onset abdominal pain following a possible syncopal episode. Abdominal ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) revealed right-sided perirenal hemorrhage that extended into the peritoneum. The dog was discharged following stabilization with analgesia, fluid therapy, and tranexamic acid. One month later, the patient presented with identical clinical signs. A CT scan at this stage revealed bilateral kidney infarcts with new left-sided perirenal hemorrhage. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound were repeated and showed similar findings. Follow up with four-dimensional CT angiography revealed bilateral renal arterial malformations, likely causing spontaneous renal hemorrhage and secondary subcapsular hematomas , retroperitoneal and peritoneal hemorrhage. UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: This is the first reported case of both bilateral renal arterial malformations and bilateral spontaneous subcapsular and perirenal hemorrhage in the absence of neoplasia, coagulopathy, or trauma in a dog. Advanced imaging modalities, including selective angiography, were required to diagnose this condition successfully. Arterial malformations should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of hemoretroperitoneum. Nephrectomy due to perirenal hemorrhage should be cautiously considered, especially in the absence of angiography, because of the sequential bilateral nature of this case. Conservative management in this case resulted in a good long-term outcome 10 months later.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brant, Bethaney J</author><author>Singleton, David A</author><author>Noble, P J M</author><author>Radford, Alan D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonality and risk factors for grass seed foreign bodies in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>105499</pages><volume>197</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Plant Breeding</keyword><keyword>Poaceae</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Seeds</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34583207</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105499</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Grass seed foreign bodies (GSFBs) are a familiar presentation, especially in  dogs, associated with a variety of clinical signs depending on site of penetration and extent of migration. Seasonality and risk factors for GSFB occurrence were investigated using electronic health records from a sentinel voluntary network of 245 veterinary practices in the United Kingdom between 17th March 2014 and 18th September 2020. Clinical narrative text mining of 4,580,503 canine consultations produced a final case dataset of 1,037 consultations where GSFBs had been recorded in individual dogs. Cases of GSFBs were recorded in all months, with 940 (90.6 %) recorded between June and September. In particular, the odds of GSFBs in July was almost 176 times more than that of January (Odds ratio, OR, 175.6, 95 % Confidence interval, CI, 43.5-707.7, P &lt; 0.001). Compared to the retriever breed type, spaniel breed types were 7.7 times more likely to present with a GSFB (CI 5.4-11.0, P &lt; 0.001). Other significant risk factors associated with recorded GSFBs for this population included being male (OR = 1.4, CI 1.2-1.6, P &lt; 0.001), and geographical location. When compared to the South East of England, risk was lowest in Wales (OR = 0.1, CI 0.0-0.3, P=&lt;0.001), and highest in the East of England (OR = 1.9, 1.2-2.9, P = 0.003), and overall risk in urban areas was reduced (OR = 0.8, CI 0.7-1.0, P = 0.024). These observations provide a number of areas for temporally targeted health campaigns at specific types of dogs, to reduce the impact of GSFBs on canine welfare.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Robbins, Patrick J</author><author>Ramos, Meghan T</author><author>Zanghi, Brian M</author><author>Otto, Cynthia M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental and Physiological Factors Associated With Stamina in Dogs  Exercising in High Ambient Temperatures.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>144</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28955711</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2017.00144</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This IACUC approved study was performed to evaluate the environmental,  physiological, and hematological components that contribute to stamina following successive bouts of exercise that included searching (5-min), agility (5-min), and ball retrieve (&lt;10-min). Regularly exercised dogs (N = 12) were evaluated on five separate occasions. The population consisted of eight males and four females ranging in age from 8 to 23 months, which included six Labrador retrievers, three German shepherds, and one each English springer spaniel, German wirehaired pointer, and Dutch shepherd. The exercise period was up to 30 min with 5 min of intermittent rest between the exercise bouts or until a designated trainer determined that the dog appeared fatigued (e.g., curled tongue while panting, seeking shade, or voluntary reluctance to retrieve). At the end of the exercise period, pulse rate (PR), core temperature, blood lactate, and venous blood gas were collected. The median outdoor temperature was 28.9°C (84°F) (IQR; 27.2-30°C/81-86°F) and median humidity was 47% (IQR; 40-57%). Median duration of exercise was 27 min (IQR; 25-29). No dog showed signs of heat stress that required medical intervention. The components used to measure stamina in this study were total activity, post-exercise core body temperature (CBT), and increase in CBT. When controlling for breed, total activity, as measured by omnidirectional accelerometer device, could be predicted from a linear combination of the independent variables: pre-exercise activity (p = 0.008), post-exercise activity (p &lt; 0.001), outdoor temperature (p = 0.005), reduction in base excess in extracellular fluid compartment (BEecf) (p = 0.044), and decrease in TCO(2) (p = 0.005). When controlling for breed and sex, increase in CBT could be predicted from a linear combination of the independent variables: study day (p = 0.005), increase in PR (p &lt; 0.001), increase in lactate (p = 0.001), reduction in BEecf (p = 0.031), increase in glucose (p = 0.044), increase in hematocrit (p = 0.032), and increase in hemoglobin (p = 0.038). This study suggests that the influence of outdoor temperature, pre- and post-exercise activity, and the metabolic parameters are important components of stamina associated with exertion.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nghiem, Peter P</author><author>Bello, Luca</author><author>Balog-Alvarez, Cindy</author><author>López, Sara Mata</author><author>Bettis, Amanda</author><author>Barnett, Heather</author><author>Hernandez, Briana</author><author>Schatzberg, Scott J</author><author>Piercy, Richard J</author><author>Kornegay, Joe N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Whole genome sequencing reveals a 7 base-pair deletion in DMD exon 42 in a dog  with muscular dystrophy.</title><secondary-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</full-title></periodical><pages>106-113</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Alternative Splicing</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dystrophin</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Introns</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred mdx</keyword><keyword>Muscular Dystrophies</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger</keyword><keyword>Sequence Deletion</keyword><keyword>Whole Genome Sequencing</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28028563</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00335-016-9675-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Dystrophin is a key cytoskeletal protein coded by the Duchenne muscular dystrophy  (DMD) gene located on the X-chromosome. Truncating mutations in the DMD gene cause loss of dystrophin and the classical DMD clinical syndrome. Spontaneous DMD gene mutations and associated phenotypes occur in several other species. The mdx mouse model and the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine model have been used extensively to study DMD disease pathogenesis and show efficacy and side effects of putative treatments. Certain DMD gene mutations in high-risk, the so-called hot spot areas can be particularly helpful in modeling molecular therapies. Identification of specific mutations has been greatly enhanced by new genomic methods. Whole genome, next generation sequencing (WGS) has been recently used to define DMD patient mutations, but has not been used in dystrophic dogs. A dystrophin-deficient Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dog was evaluated at the functional, histopathological, biochemical, and molecular level. The affected dog's phenotype was compared to the previously reported canine dystrophinopathies. WGS was then used to detect a 7 base pair deletion in DMD exon 42 (c.6051-6057delTCTCAAT mRNA), predicting a frameshift in gene transcription and truncation of dystrophin protein translation. The deletion was confirmed with conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. This mutation is in a secondary DMD gene hotspot area distinct from the one identified earlier at the 5' donor splice site of intron 50 in the CKCS breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Torrez, C V</author><author>Hunt, G B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Results of surgical correction of abnormalities associated with brachycephalic  airway obstruction syndrome in dogs in Australia.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>150-154</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Airway Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Constriction, Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dyspnea</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Laryngeal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nasal Cavity</keyword><keyword>Palate, Soft</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16512847</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00059.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features of brachycephalic airway obstructive  disease in dogs, the incidence of laryngeal collapse in dogs presenting for surgery and the outcome after surgery in dogs with laryngeal collapse. METHODS: Basic clinical details were reviewed retrospectively in 73 dogs. Presence of laryngeal collapse and short-term outcomes after surgery were determined for 64 dogs with complete medical records. Long-term outcomes were reviewed for 46 dogs by telephone survey between 19 and 77 months following surgery. RESULTS: Stenotic nares were present in 31 dogs (42.5 per cent), elongated soft palate in 63 (86.3 per cent) and everted laryngeal saccules in 43 (58.9 per cent). The most common breeds were the pug (19 dogs, 26 per cent), Cavalier King Charles spaniel (15 dogs, 20.5 per cent), British bulldog (14 dogs, 19.2 per cent) and Staffordshire bull terrier (4 dogs, 5.5 per cent). Laryngeal collapse was present in 34 of 64 (53 per cent) dogs. No dogs died perioperatively and only one dog was euthanased as a result of its respiratory disease three years after surgery. Telephone interviews indicated that 26 dogs (56.5 per cent) were much improved after surgery, 15 (32.6 per cent) had some improvement and 5 (10.9 per cent) showed no improvement. Signs that persisted after surgery were snoring during sleep (34 dogs, 73.9 per cent), stertor/stridor while conscious (23 dogs, 50 per cent), excessive panting (13 dogs, 28.3 per cent) and dyspnoea (10 dogs, 21.7 per cent). Long-term outcome was considered good, even in dogs with laryngeal collapse. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Laryngeal collapse is relatively common in dogs presented for surgical correction of brachycephalic airway obstructive disease. Dogs with severe laryngeal collapse often respond well to surgery. Clinical signs rarely resolve completely following surgery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kristofiková, Zdena</author><author>Stástný, Frantisek</author><author>Bubeniková, Vera</author><author>Druga, Rastislav</author><author>Klaschka, Jan</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Age- and sex-dependent laterality of rat hippocampal cholinergic system in  relation to animal models of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.</title><secondary-title>Neurochemical research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neurochemical research</full-title></periodical><pages>671-680</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Functional Laterality</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neurodegenerative Diseases</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Wistar</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Cholinergic</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15098928</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/b:nere.0000018837.27383.ff</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Studies suggest age- and sex-dependent structural and functional patterns of  human cerebral lateralization underlie hemisphere specialization and its alterations in schizophrenia. Recent works report sexual dimorphism of neurons in the hippocampal formation and specialization of hemispheres in rats. Our experiments indicate for the first time functional lateralization of the high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) system directly associated with a synthesis of acetylcholine in the hippocampus of Wistar rats. The markedly increased HACU activity was found in the left compared to the right hippocampus of adult male but not female animals. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed a statistically significant increase of Vmax in the left hippocampus of 14-day-old when compared to 7-day-old males. It appears that laterality of HACU occurs during late postnatal maturation, and its degree is markedly enhanced after puberty and attenuated during aging. Quinolinic acid (QUIN), an endogenous agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptors, was used in this study to evaluate the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. It is known that elevated levels of QUIN accompany viral infections, increasing the risk of developing schizophrenia. Bilateral intracerebroventricular application of QUIN (250 nmoles/ventricle) to pups aged 12 days significantly impaired the cholinergic hippocampal system of adolescent male and female rats and reversed lateralization of male HACU. Morphological analysis indicated marked changes in brain lesion sizes (extensive 24 h and moderate 38 days after the operation). Asymmetry of lesions was observed in the majority of cases, but the left hemisphere was not generally more vulnerable to QUIN effects than the right side. Moreover, no lateral differences were found between lesioned hippocampi in the specific binding of [3H]hemicholinium-3 (10%-15% loss of binding sites when compared to sham-operated animals). In summary, our results indicate a symmetrical drop in the number of choline carriers of lesioned male rats but a asymmetrical decrease in the activity of remaing carriers, suggesting defects in processes of sexual brain differentiation, leading under normal conditions to the higher activity of carriers in the left hippocampus. The data demonstrate viral infection-mediated alterations in normal patterns of brain asymmetry and are discussed in relation to animal models of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyers-Wallen, Vicki N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetics, genomics, and molecular biology of sex determination in small animals.</title><secondary-title>Theriogenology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theriogenology</full-title></periodical><pages>1655-1658</pages><volume>66</volume><issue>6-7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genomics</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sex Chromosome Aberrations</keyword><keyword>Sex Determination Processes</keyword><keyword>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16466782</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.029</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The genomic revolution is beginning to facilitate advances in canine and feline  medicine, as illustrated in our research. Our studies are focused upon identifying the gene mutation that causes canine Sry-negative XX sex reversal, a disorder of sex determination in which chromosomal females (78,XX) develop testicular tissue, becoming either XX true hermaphrodites with ovotestes, or XX males with bilateral testes. A genome-wide screen, using mapped markers in our pedigree of Sry-negative XX sex reversed dogs founded upon the American cocker spaniel, identified five chromosomal regions in which the causative gene may be located. The canine genome was used to identify the canine homologue of goat Pisrt1 and so determine that canine and caprine Sry-negative XX sex reversal are genetically heterogeneous. A second goal of our research is to determine the molecular mechanism by which the mutation causes testis induction. Thus far, we have reported gonadal Sry and Sox9 expression patterns in normal embryos, which have temporal and spatial patterns similar to those reported in humans, sheep, and pigs. Once gene mutations causing such inherited disorders are identified, DNA tests will become a part of general veterinary practice, advancing both diagnostic techniques and preventative medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kriström, K</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Tidholm, A</author><author>Yu, J Z</author><author>Fascetti, A J</author><author>Ljungvall, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of blood tube additives and timing of sampling on blood taurine  concentrations in clinically healthy dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-70</pages><volume>45</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Edetic Acid</keyword><keyword>Heparin</keyword><keyword>Taurine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36702086</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2022.12.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Dilated cardiomyopathy can be associated with taurine deficiency in  dogs. Blood taurine concentrations can be analyzed in whole blood (WB) and plasma. The study objectives were to investigate agreement between taurine concentrations measured in WB, heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma, determine intraindividual variation in healthy dogs, and evaluate if time from feeding to sampling impacts concentrations. ANIMALS: Ten English Cocker spaniels and 10 dogs of various breeds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dogs were fasted 12 h prior to initial blood sampling, and the blood was collected at five occasions over eight h. Food was offered immediately after first and one h after fourth sampling time point. RESULTS: Agreement between taurine concentrations in EDTA plasma and heparinized plasma was good (mean difference 4.5 nmol/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 36.8-45.8 nmol/mL). Whole blood concentrations were systematically higher than EDTA and heparin plasma concentrations (mean difference 132.7 nmol/mL, 95% CI 23.6-241.8 nmol/mL, and 127.6 nmol/mL, 95% CI 28.6-226.6 nmol/mL, respectively, all P &lt; 0.001). Intraindividual daily variations in taurine concentration were seen in all additives, with largest variations in plasma (P &lt; 0.001). Taurine concentration in heparinized plasma was higher at first and fifth sampling time points compared to the fourth (P = 0.014). DISCUSSION: Agreement was found between taurine concentrations measured in different additives, with expected higher concentration in WB than plasma. Taurine concentrations measured in heparinized plasma varied with sampling time point. Intraindividual daily variations were observed in all additives, but mainly in plasma samples. CONCLUSION: Taurine concentrations in dogs with suspected deficiency should be interpreted with caution.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holdsworth, Jaclyn P</author><author>Marino, Dominic J</author><author>Loughin, Catherine A</author><author>Miller, Andrew D</author><author>Sackman, Joseph J</author><author>Lesser, Martin L</author><author>O'Donnell, Marissa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biopsy and histologic findings of the dura mater at the level of the foramen  magnum in 121 CKCS with Chiari-like malformation.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>954092</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36157194</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2022.954092</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>To describe histopathologic features found in dural biopsies of Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with Chiari-like malformation (CM) and identify any associations between age, duration of clinical signs, syrinx location or syringomyelia (SM, and quality of life (QOL). The medical records of 121 consecutive client owned CKCS with CM and SM, confirmed by whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), that underwent foramen magnum decompression (FMD) with cranioplasty and durectomy with biopsy from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Dural biopsies were submitted to a board-certified veterinary pathologist for histopathologic interpretation. The chi-square test was used to analyze associations between histologic findings and categorical variables. For continuous measures, the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to compare distributions across pathology categories. A result was considered statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level of significance. The mean age, duration of pre-surgical clinical signs, and pre-operative QOL (1-5 scale) were 44.27 months, 44.78 weeks, and 2.72, respectively. Syringomyelia was found in the cervical region only in 39 of 121 (32.23%) of dogs, in the cervical and thoracic region only in 17 of 121 (14.05%) of dogs, and in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar region combined in 65 of 121 (53.72%) of dogs. Sixty-six of one hundred twenty-one (54.55%) dural biopsy specimens had histopathology changes; fifty-five (45.45%) did not. Forty-three of one hundred twenty-one (35.54%) dural biopsy specimens had osseous metaplasia, 16 of 121 (13.22%) had evidence of fibrosis, 4 of 121 (3.31%) had arachnoid hyperplasia, and 3 of 121 (2.48%) had evidence of mineralization. Most dogs with CM were found to have histopathologic changes in the dura at the time of FMD cranioplasty was performed. These dural changes can be observed in dogs experiencing clinical signs for a time period as short as 4 weeks prior to presentation. The histopathologic changes were not associated with age, breed, duration of clinical signs, the location of syringomyelia or QOL. The influence of histopathologic changes on long-term prognosis in dogs without dural decompression is unknown since all dogs in this study had dural resection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cebrian, Prado</author><author>Escanilla, Natalia</author><author>Lowe, Robert C</author><author>Dawson, Charlotte</author><author>Sanchez, Rick F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Corneo-limbo-conjunctival transposition to treat deep and perforating corneal  ulcers in dogs: A review of 418 eyes and corneal clarity scoring in 111 eyes.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>48-58</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Conjunctiva</keyword><keyword>Cornea</keyword><keyword>Corneal Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Corneal Ulcer</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Limbus Corneae</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Care</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>transplantation</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33034144</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12833</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: To report surgical and corneal clarity scores (CCSs) of  corneo-limbo-conjunctival transpositions (CLCTs) in a large number of canine cases. METHODS: Retrospective review of records that underwent CLCT to repair deep ulcers or perforations between 2002 and 2018. Signalment, concurrent eye disease, additional procedures, pathogenesis, medication, graft orientation, follow-up, and CCSs were recorded. RESULTS: 418 eyes of 399 dogs were included. Brachycephalics were most commonly affected, comprising 325/418 (77.75%) of the eyes. The most commonly affected breeds were Pugs, Shih Tzus, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and French Bulldogs, with 116/418 (27.75%), 64/418 (15.31%), 34/418 (8.13%), and 34/418 (8.13%) ulcerated eyes, respectively. Mean age at surgery was 5.5 years (range 59 days-17.7 years), and median follow-up time was 100 days (range 3 days-7.64 years). The most common etiopathogenesis was spontaneous ulceration in 205/418 eyes (49.04%) of which 191 (93.17%) occurred in brachycephalics. Primary keratoconjunctivitis sicca affected 122/418 eyes (29.19%) and injury 39/418 eyes (9.33%). Mean ulcer width was 3.5 mm (0.5-10 mm). Success rate was 97.13% (406/418 eyes). Failure end points recorded included no menace response, secondary glaucoma, and endophthalmitis. Pre-existing perforation was found in 101/418 (24.16%) of the eyes and significantly increased failure rate (P &lt; .001). The median CCS was G3 (G0-G4), which was lower for Pugs (G2). Graft orientation affected CCS, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The high success rate and CCS for CLCT in dogs make it a good technique to treat deep ulcers but a less desirable outcome is anticipated when treating perforations and Pugs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skelly, B J</author><author>Wallace, M</author><author>Rajpurohit, Y R</author><author>Wang, P</author><author>Giger, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a 6 base pair insertion in West Highland White Terriers with  erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1169-1172</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA, Complementary</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Agar Gel</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Erythrocytes</keyword><keyword>Genetic Carrier Screening</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Homozygote</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pyruvate Kinase</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10490091</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To define the disease-causing mutation in West Highland White Terriers  (WHWT) with erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (R-PK) deficiency and to design a genetic test capable of recognizing affected (homozygous) and carrier (heterozygous) dogs. ANIMALS: 3 anemic WHWT littermates and 1 unaffected littermate; 16 dogs from the same kennel, including 4 unrelated, phenotypically normal dogs (control dogs), and 12 for which PK activity was not known; 2 PK-deficient Basenjis; 2 PK-deficient Beagles; 4 unaffected English Springer Spaniels; and 1 mixed-breed dog. PROCEDURES: cDNA was cloned and sequenced, and cDNA sequences were compared with the published sequence for canine R-PK cDNA to identify the putative disease-causing mutation. Genomic DNA spanning the affected region was cloned and sequenced to verify the mutation. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify the section of the gene containing the mutation from DNA in blood or buccal swab samples. Gel electrophoresis allowed assignment of genotypes on the basis of allele separation. RESULTS: 4 single base polymorphisms attributable to sequencing errors in the published sequence were identified, along with a 6 base pair (bp) insertion in exon 10 that was recognized as a putative disease-causing mutation. An identical insertion was found in genomic DNA. Amplification of genomic DNA yielded a 117 bp product for genotypically normal dogs and a 123 bp product for WHWT homozygous for PK deficiency. Carriers had 1 copy of each allele and variable heteroduplex structures. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A 6 bp insertion in the C domain of R-PK was identified in WHWT with PK deficiency. Affected and carrier dogs could be distinguished with a genetic test.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Papageorgiou, Virginia</author><author>Kazakos, George</author><author>Anagnostou, Tilemachos</author><author>Polizopoulou, Zoi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Role of Magnesium in the Management of Acute and Long-Term Symptoms Caused by  Tetanus in Two Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>100535</pages><volume>44</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Clostridium tetani</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnesium</keyword><keyword>Magnesium Sulfate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Metronidazole</keyword><keyword>Tetanus</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33933700</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tcam.2021.100535</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Tetanus in dogs is a relatively uncommon neurological disease caused by the  sporogenic bacillus Clostridium tetani. This disease is associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality rates from 8%-50%. A 2-year-old, neutered male King Charles Spaniel and an approximately 8-months-old female Mongrel dog presented to Companion Animal Clinic with symptoms of muscle rigidity and generalized stiffness. A tentative diagnosis of generalized tetanus was made in both dogs. Treatment consisted of IV fluids, antibiotics (metronidazole), human tetanus antitoxin, analgesics and supportive care. Muscle relaxation was provided by midazolam. Acetylpromazine meleate was added to the treatment of the second dog to better control excitability. Each dog received magnesium therapy on the 10th and 3rd days, respectively; which was provided per os to the first dog and constant rate infusion (4 mg/kg/h) to the second dog. The addition of magnesium helped to increase muscle relaxation and increased the time interval between acetylpromazine administration. On the tenth day, magnesium sulfate was discontinued from the second dog and magnesium aspartate (12 mg/kg), twice a day, per os was administered in both animals. Further muscle relaxation was noted in both dogs with a substantial reduction of tetanus symptoms. Both dogs were discharged from Intensive Care Unit on the 14th and 13th day respectively with sole treatment of magnesium aspartate (12 mg/kg) orally, twice a day. Magnesium aspartate was continued for 14 days and 12 days respectively. Both dogs had progressive reduction of muscle rigidity and the first dog recovered completely. The second dog presented again with muscle rigidity and increased spinal reflexes after the discontinuation of magnesium aspartate, thus therapy with magnesium aspartate was started again and symptoms subsided after the second oral dose of magnesium. Therapy was continued for two more weeks during which muscle rigidity subsided and then was stopped. At that time, tetanus symptoms did not relapse and the dog was considered fully recovered. According to the findings of this case series, magnesium therapy may provide further muscle relaxation during the standard therapeutic protocol of tetanus in dogs. In addition, long term symptoms of the disease were adequately managed with the administration of magnesium aspartate, orally.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beer, Kari Santoro</author><author>Balakrishnan, Anusha</author><author>Hart, Samantha K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Successful management of persistent tachycardia using esmolol in 2 dogs with  septic shock.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)</full-title></periodical><pages>326-330</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Digestive System Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drug Therapy, Combination</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Norepinephrine</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Propanolamines</keyword><keyword>Shock, Septic</keyword><keyword>Tachycardia, Supraventricular</keyword><keyword>Vasoconstrictor Agents</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31044499</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vec.12830</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the successful management of 2 dogs with septic shock and  persistent tachycardia using norepinephrine and esmolol, a short-acting beta receptor antagonist. SERIES SUMMARY: Two cases are reviewed. In the first case, septic shock with ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed in a 4-year-old neutered female Great Dane that underwent jejunoileal resection and anastomosis for a partial mesenteric torsion. The patient's tachyarrhythmias failed to respond to lidocaine, and an esmolol infusion was used for heart rate control. The condition of the dog improved and she was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization. The second case was a 7-year-old neutered female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with septic peritonitis. Following surgery for intestinal resection and anastomosis, supraventricular tachycardia developed that was not responsive to volume resuscitation and was treated with an esmolol infusion. The condition of the dog improved and she was discharged after 6 days of hospitalization. Both patients were doing well at the time of long-term follow-up. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: This case series highlights a novel method of managing dogs in septic shock with persistent tachycardia based on recently published data in the human literature. The use of esmolol may be considered in certain veterinary patients with septic shock to improve persistent tachycardia not related to hypovolemia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reynolds, M E</author><author>Phan, H T T</author><author>George, S</author><author>Hubbard, A T M</author><author>Stoesser, N</author><author>Maciuca, I E</author><author>Crook, D W</author><author>Timofte, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Occurrence and characterization of Escherichia coli ST410 co-harbouring blaNDM-5,  blaCMY-42 and blaTEM-190 in a dog from the UK.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1207-1211</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections</keyword><keyword>Genome, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Genomics</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Whole Genome Sequencing</keyword><keyword>beta-Lactamases</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30753576</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jac/dkz017</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are a  public health threat, and have been found in humans, animals and the environment. Carbapenems are not authorized for use in EU or UK companion animals, and the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CRGNB) in this population is unknown. METHODS: We investigated CRGNB isolated from animal specimens received by one diagnostic laboratory from 34 UK veterinary practices (September 2015-December 2016). Any Gram-negative isolates from clinical specimens showing reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and/or aminoglycosides and/or cephalosporins were investigated phenotypically and genotypically for carbapenemases. A complete genome assembly (Illumina/Nanopore) was generated for the single isolate identified to investigate the genetic context for carbapenem resistance. RESULTS: One ST410 Escherichia coli isolate [(CARB35); 1/191, 0.5%], cultured from a wound in a springer spaniel, harboured a known carbapenem resistance gene (blaNDM-5). The gene was located in the chromosome on an integrated 100 kb IncF plasmid, also harbouring other drug resistance genes (mrx, sul1, ant1 and dfrA). The isolate also contained blaCMY-42 and blaTEM-190 on two separate plasmids (IncI1 and IncFII, respectively) that showed homology with other publicly available plasmid sequences from Italy and Myanmar. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the use of carbapenems in companion animals is restricted, the concurrent presence of blaCMY-42 and other antimicrobial resistance genes could lead to co-selection of carbapenemase genes in this population. Further studies investigating the selection and flow of plasmids carrying important resistance genes amongst humans and companion animals are needed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salas, Yaritza</author><author>Márquez, Adelys</author><author>Diaz, Daniel</author><author>Romero, Laura</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological Study of Mammary Tumors in Female Dogs Diagnosed during the  Period 2002-2012: A Growing Animal Health Problem.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0127381</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Mammary Glands, Animal</keyword><keyword>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</keyword><keyword>Mexico</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25992997</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0127381</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Epidemiological studies enable us to analyze disease behavior, define risk  factors and establish fundamental prognostic criteria, with the purpose of studying different types of diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of canine mammary tumors diagnosed during the period 2002-2012. The study was based on a retrospective study consisting of 1,917 biopsies of intact dogs that presented mammary gland lesions. Biopsies were sent to the Department of Pathology FMVZ-UNAM diagnostic service. The annual incidence of mammary tumors was 16.8%: 47.7% (benign) and 47.5% (malignant). The highest number of cases was epithelial, followed by mixed tumors. The most commonly diagnosed tumors were tubular adenoma, papillary adenoma, tubular carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, solid carcinoma, complex carcinoma and carcinosarcoma. Pure breeds accounted for 80% of submissions, and the Poodle, Cocker Spaniel and German Shepherd were consistently affected. Adult female dogs (9 to 12 years old) were most frequently involved, followed by 5- to 8-year-old females. Some association between breeds with histological types of malignant tumors was observed, but no association was found between breeds and BN. Mammary tumors in intact dogs had a high incidence. Benign and malignant tumors had similar frequencies, with an increase in malignant tumors in the past four years of the study. Epithelial tumors were more common, and the most affected were old adult females, purebreds and small-sized dogs. Mammary tumors in dogs are an important animal health problem that needs to be solved by improving veterinary oncology services in Mexico.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gelatt, Kirk N</author><author>Mackay, Edward O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of primary breed-related cataracts in the dog in North America.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>101-111</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>North America</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15762923</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00352.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of cataracts in dogs  presented to veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America between 1964 and 2003. A retrospective study of all dogs presented with cataracts to veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America between 1964 and 2003 was conducted to determine cataract prevalence. The different decades, breeds, gender, and age at time of presentation with cataract were compared. The prevalence of dogs presented with cataract varied by decade and ranged from 0.95% (1964-73), 1.88% (1974-83), 2.42% (1994-2003), to 3.5% (1984-93). The total number of dogs presented with cataracts over the 40-year period was 39,229. From 1964 to 2003 the prevalence of cataract formation in this patient population increased by about 255%. Fifty-nine breeds of dogs were affected with cataracts above the baseline prevalence of 1.61% seen in mixed-breed/hybrid dogs. The breeds with the highest cataract prevalence included: Smooth Fox Terrier (11.70%), Havanese (11.57%), Bichon Frise (11.45%), Boston Terrier (11.11%), Miniature Poodle (10.79%), Silky Terrier (10.29%) and Toy Poodle (10.21%). The breeds with the largest number of cataractous dogs during the entire four decades were the Boston Terrier (11.11%), Miniature Poodle (10.79%), American Cocker Spaniel (8.77%), Standard Poodle (7.00%), and Miniature Schnauzer (4.98%). Gender ratios of cataractous dogs seemed to affect limited breeds. Age of presentation with cataract diagnosis varied among several breeds. In the mixed-breed/hybrid baseline population, cataract formation appeared to be age related with a higher frequency of cataract formation in dogs after 4-7 years. Cataract formation is one of the most prevalent eye diseases in the dog population, and in about 60 breeds of dogs the prevalence of cataract exceeds that of the baseline mixed-breed/hybrid group. The prevalence of cataract is also influenced by age in most purebred dogs and affects 16.80% of the 7-15+-year-old mixed-breed/hybrid dog population. Total and age-related cataract prevalence in dogs seems very similar to that in man.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holder, Angela L</author><author>Kennedy, Lorna J</author><author>Ollier, William E R</author><author>Catchpole, Brian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed differences in development of anti-insulin antibodies in diabetic dogs and  investigation of the role of dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) genes.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</full-title></periodical><pages>130-138</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class I</keyword><keyword>Insulin</keyword><keyword>Insulin Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Insulin, Regular, Pork</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26272177</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.07.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Administration of insulin for treatment of diabetes mellitus in dogs can  stimulate an immune response, with a proportion of animals developing anti-insulin antibodies (AIA). For an IgG antibody response to occur, this would require B cell presentation of insulin peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, encoded by dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) genes, in order to receive T-cell help for class switching. DLA genes are highly polymorphic in the dog population and vary from breed to breed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate AIA reactivity in diabetic dogs of different breeds and to investigate whether DLA genes influence AIA status. Indirect ELISA was used to determine serological reactivity to insulin in diabetic dogs, treated with either a porcine or bovine insulin preparation. DLA haplotypes for diabetic dogs were determined by sequence-based typing of DLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 loci. Significantly greater insulin reactivity was seen in treated diabetic dogs (n=942) compared with non-diabetic dogs (n=100). Relatively few newly diagnosed diabetic dogs (3/109) were found to be AIA positive, although this provides evidence that insulin autoantibodies might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease in some cases. Of the diabetic dogs treated with a bovine insulin preparation, 52.3% (182/348) were AIA positive, compared with 12.6% (75/594) of dogs treated with a porcine insulin preparation, suggesting that bovine insulin is more immunogenic. Breeds such as dachshund, Cairn terrier, miniature schnauzer and Tibetan terrier were more likely to develop AIA, whereas cocker spaniels were less likely to develop AIA, compared with crossbreed dogs. In diabetic dogs, DLA haplotype DRB1*0015--DQA1*006--DQB1*023 was associated with being AIA positive, whereas the haplotype DLA-DRB1*006--DQA1*005--DQB1*007 showed an association with being AIA negative. These research findings suggest that DLA genes influence AIA responses in treated diabetic dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quezado, Z M</author><author>Hoffman, W D</author><author>Winkelstein, J A</author><author>Yatsiv, I</author><author>Koev, C A</author><author>Cork, L C</author><author>Elin, R J</author><author>Eichacker, P Q</author><author>Natanson, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The third component of complement protects against Escherichia coli  endotoxin-induced shock and multiple organ failure.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>569-578</pages><volume>179</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</keyword><keyword>Complement C3</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endotoxins</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Hemodynamics</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen-Ion Concentration</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Multiple Organ Failure</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Shock, Septic</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>8294868</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1084/jem.179.2.569</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We investigated whether the third component of complement (C3) is involved in the  pathophysiology of endotoxic shock, and if it is involved, whether it plays a protective role or whether it mediates shock and multiple organ failure. In a prospective, controlled investigation, six Brittany spaniels that were homozygous for a genetically determined deficiency of C3 (C3 deficient, &lt; 0.003% of normal serum C3 levels) and six heterozygous littermates (controls, approximately 50% of mean normal serum C3 level) were given 2 mg/kg of reconstituted Escherichia coli 026:B6 acetone powder as a source of endotoxin, intravenously. All animals were given similar fluid and prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and had serial hemodynamic variables obtained. After E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient animals had higher peak levels of endotoxin and less of a rise in temperature than controls (P &lt; 0.05). During the first 4 h after E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient animals had significantly greater decreases in mean central venous pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure than controls (P &lt; 0.02). During the first 48 h after E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient animals had significantly greater decreases in mean arterial pH, left ventricular ejection fraction, and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and greater increases in mean arterial lactate, arterial-alveolar O2 gradient, and transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) than controls, (all P &lt; 0.05). After E. coli endotoxin infusion, C3-deficient animals compared to controls had significantly less of a decrease in mean C5 levels (P &lt; 0.01), but similar (P = NS) increases in circulating tumor necrosis factor levels, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils, and protein, and similar (P = NS) decreases in blood leukocytes and platelets. Two of six C3-deficient animals and two of six controls died. In summary, after intravenous infusion of E. coli endotoxin, canines with C3 deficiency have decreased endotoxin clearance and worse E. coli endotoxin-induced shock and organ damage. Thus, the third component of the complement system plays a beneficial role in the host defense against E. coli endotoxic shock.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author><author>Falk, Torkel</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Tarnow, Inge</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Kvart, Clarence</author><author>Nielsen, Mette O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 in dogs with naturally  occurring mitral regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>528-532</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16095170</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2005)19[528:ccoigf]2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which mediates most effects of growth  hormone, has effects on cardiac mass and function, and plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone. In humans, an inverse relationship between degree of heart failure (HF) and circulating IGF-1 concentrations has been found in several studies. In dogs with HF, few studies have focused on IGF-1. We examined circulating IGF-1 concentrations in dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease. Study 1 included 88 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) with a broad range of asymptomatic MR (median serum IGF-1: 76.7 microg/L; 25-75 percentile, 59.8-104.9 microg/L). As expected, standard body weight and percentage under- or overweight correlated directly with IGF-1. MR (assessed in 4 different ways) did not correlate with IGF-1. In study 2, 28 dogs with severe MR and stable, treated congestive HF had similar serum IGF-1 concentrations (median, 100.8 g/L; 25-75 percentile, 74.9-156.5 microg/L) as 11 control dogs (79.6 microg/L; 25-75 percentile, 64.1-187.4 microg/L; P = .84). In study 3, the plasma IGF-1 concentration of 15 untreated CKCSs with severe MR was 16.4 +/- 24.2 microg/L lower (P = .02) at the examination when decompensated HF had developed (80.8 +/- 30.9 microg/L) than at a visit 1-12 months earlier (97.2 +/- 39.8 microg/L), possibly in part due to an altered state of nutrition. The studies document that circulating IGF-1 concentrations are not altered before development of congestive HF in dogs with naturally occurring MR, but decrease by approximately 20% with the development of untreated HE In treated HF, circulating IGF-1 concentrations apparently return to within the reference range.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barros, Paulo S M</author><author>Safatle, Angelica M V</author><author>Queiroz, Lelio</author><author>Silva, Vanessa V</author><author>Barros, Silvia B M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blood and aqueous humour antioxidants in cataractous poodles.</title><secondary-title>Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

Protein oxidation is one of the mechanisms involved in lens opacification and may be causally related to depleted or diminished endogenous antioxidant defences. We evaluated the levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in blood and aqueous humour of cataractous poodles in comparison to noncataractous poodles. METHODS: We studied 35 cataractous poodles aged 2 to 11 years, 14 noncataractous poodles and 15 noncataractous mixed-breed dogs. The activity of erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD]) was evaluated in 18 cataractous poodles and 14 noncataractous poodles. We evaluated ascorbic acid levels in plasma of all animals and in aqueous humour of cataractous poodles and mixed-breed dogs. The dogs were deprived of food for 12 hours before sampling. Blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein before and during anesthesia. Aqueous humour samples were obtained just before the anterior chamber was opened. RESULTS: The activity of superoxide dismutase, G6PD and catalase was significantly higher in noncataractous poodles than in cataractous poodles (p &lt; or = 0.05). The activity of glutathione peroxidase was lower in noncataractous poodles than in cataractous poodles, but not significantly so. There was no difference in mean plasma ascorbic acid concentration between cataractous poodles (21.3 microM [standard deviation (SD) 7.4 microM]), noncataractous poodles (21.6 microM [SD 7.4 microM]) and non-cataractous mixed-breed dogs (25.8 microM [SD 7.5 microM]). Similarly, there was no difference in mean aqueous humour ascorbic acid concentration between cataractous poodles (191.7 microM [SD 62.0 microM] and noncataractous mixed-breed dogs (215.7 microM [SD 91.8 microM]). INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that, at least in the population studied here, no correlation exists between the onset of cataract and ascorbic acid concentration in blood and aqueous humour. The decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes may explain in part the onset of cataract in poodles.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nalborczyk, Zoe R</author><author>McFadyen, Angus K</author><author>Jovanovik, Jelena</author><author>Tauro, Anna</author><author>Driver, Colin J</author><author>Fitzpatrick, Noel</author><author>Knower, Susan P</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MRI characteristics for &quot;phantom&quot; scratching in canine syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>340</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29145838</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-017-1258-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: A classic sign of canine syringomyelia (SM) is scratching towards one  shoulder. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we investigate the spinal cord lesion relating to this phenomenon which has characteristics similar to fictive scratch secondary to spinal cord transection. Medical records were searched for Cavalier King Charles spaniels with a clinical and MRI diagnosis of symptomatic SM associated with Chiari-like malformation (CM). The cohort was divided into SM with phantom scratching (19 dogs) and SM but no phantom scratching (18 dogs). MRI files were anonymised, randomised and viewed in EFILM ™. For each transverse image, the maximum perpendicular dimensions of the syrinx in the dorsal spinal cord quadrants were determined. Visual assessment was made as to whether the syrinx extended to the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). RESULTS: We showed that phantom scratching appears associated with a large dorsolateral syrinx that extends to the SDH in the C3-C6 spinal cord segments (corresponding to C2-C5 vertebrae). Estimated dorsal quadrant syrinx sizes based on the perpendicular diameters were between 2.5 and 9.5 times larger in dogs with phantom scratching, with the largest mean difference p-value being 0.009. CONCLUSION: SM associated phantom scratching appears associated with MRI findings of a large syrinx extending into the mid cervical SDH. We hypothesise that damage in this region might influence the lumbosacral scratching central pattern generator (CPG). If a scratching SM affected dog does not have a large dorsolateral cervical syrinx with SDH involvement then alternative explanations for scratching should be investigated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miyadera, Keiko</author><author>Kato, Kumiko</author><author>Aguirre-Hernández, Jesús</author><author>Tokuriki, Tsuyoshi</author><author>Morimoto, Kyohei</author><author>Busse, Claudia</author><author>Barnett, Keith</author><author>Holmes, Nigel</author><author>Ogawa, Hiroyuki</author><author>Sasaki, Nobuo</author><author>Mellersh, Cathryn S</author><author>Sargan, David R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phenotypic variation and genotype-phenotype discordance in canine cone-rod  dystrophy with an RPGRIP1 mutation.</title><secondary-title>Molecular vision</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular vision</full-title></periodical><pages>2287-2305</pages><volume>15</volume><keywords><keyword>Age Distribution</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Domestic</keyword><keyword>Base Pairing</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Capillary</keyword><keyword>Electroretinography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fundus Oculi</keyword><keyword>Genetic Loci</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Insertional</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Physical Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Proteins</keyword><keyword>Retinitis Pigmentosa</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19936303</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: Previously, a 44 bp insertion in exon 2 of retinitis pigmentosa GTPase  interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1) was identified as the cause of cone-rod dystrophy 1 (cord1), a recessive form of progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) in the Miniature Longhaired Dachshund (MLHD), a dog model for Leber congenital amaurosis. The cord1 locus was mapped using MLHDs from an inbred colony with a homogeneous early onset disease phenotype. In this paper, the MLHD pet population was studied to investigate phenotypic variation and genotype-phenotype correlation. Further, the cord1 locus was fine-mapped using PRA cases from the MLHD pet population to narrow the critical region. Other dog breeds were also screened for the RGPRIP1 insertion. METHODS: This study examined phenotypic variation in an MLHD pet population that included 59 sporadic PRA cases and 18 members of an extended family with shared environment and having six PRA cases. Ophthalmologic evaluations included behavioral abnormalities, responses to menace and light, fundoscopy, and electroretinography (ERG). The RPGRIP1 insertion was screened for in all cases and 200 apparently normal control MLHDs and in 510 dogs from 66 other breed. To fine-map the cord1 locus in the MLHD, 74 PRA cases and 86 controls aged 4 years or more were genotyped for 24 polymorphic markers within the previously mapped cord1 critical region of 14.15 Mb. RESULTS: Among sporadic PRA cases from the MLHD pet population, the age of onset varied from 4 months to 15 years old; MLHDs from the extended family also showed variable onset and rate of progression. Screening for the insertion in RPGRIP1 identified substantial genotype-phenotype discordance: 16% of controls were homozygous for the insertion (RPGRIP1(-/-)), while 20% of PRA cases were not homozygous for it. Four other breeds were identified to carry the insertion including English Springer Spaniels and Beagles with insertion homozygotes. The former breed included both controls and PRA cases, yet in the latter breed, cone ERG was undetectable in two dogs with no clinically apparent visual dysfunction. Notably, the insertion in the Beagles was a longer variant of that seen in the other breeds. Fine-mapping of the cord1 locus narrowed the critical region on CFA15 from 14.15 Mb to 1.74 Mb which still contains the RPGRIP1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive phenotypic variations of onset age and progression rate were observed in PRA cases of the MLHD pet population. The insertion in RPGRIP1 showed the strongest association with the disease, yet additional as well as alternative factors may account for the substantial genotype-phenotype discordance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kvart, Clarence</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik Duelund</author><author>Hansson, Kerstin</author><author>Eriksson, Anders</author><author>Järvinen, Anna-Kaisa</author><author>Tidholm, Anna</author><author>Bsenko, Karina</author><author>Ahlgren, Erik</author><author>Ilves, Mikael</author><author>Ablad, Björn</author><author>Falk, Torkel</author><author>Bjerkfås, Ellen</author><author>Gundler, Susanne</author><author>Lord, Peter</author><author>Wegeland, Gudrun</author><author>Adolfsson, Eva</author><author>Corfitzen, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of enalapril for prevention of congestive heart failure in dogs with  myxomatous valve disease and asymptomatic mitral regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>80-88</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disease-Free Survival</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Enalapril</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Multivariate Analysis</keyword><keyword>Physical Examination</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Scandinavian and Nordic Countries</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11822810</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We evaluated the long-term effect of early angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibition (enalapril maleate) as monotherapy to postpone or prevent congestive heart failure (CHF) in asymptomatic dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) attributable to myxomatous valvular disease (MVD) in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter trial involving 14 centers in Scandinavia. Two hundred twenty-nine Cavalier King Charles (CKC) Spaniels with MR attributable to MVD but no signs of CHF were randomly allocated to treatment with enalapril 0.25-0.5 mg daily (n = 116) or to placebo groups (n = 113). Each dog was evaluated by physical examination, electrocardiography, and thoracic radiography at entry and every 12 months (+/-30 days). The number of dogs developing heart failure was similar in the treatment and placebo groups (n = 50 [43%] and n = 48 [42%], respectively; P = .99). The estimated means, adjusted for censored observations, for the period from initiation of therapy to heart failure were 1,150 +/- 50 days for dogs in the treatment group and 1,130 +/- 50 days for dogs in the placebo group (P = .85). When absence or presence of cardiomegaly at the entrance of the trial was considered, there were still no differences between the treatment and placebo groups (P = .98 and .51, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that enalapril had no significant effect on the time from initiation of therapy to heart failure (P = .86). Long-term treatment with enalapril in asymptomatic dogs with MVD and MR did not delay the onset of heart failure regardless of whether or not cardiomegaly was present at initiation of the study.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melin, Malin</author><author>Rivera, Patricio</author><author>Arendt, Maja</author><author>Elvers, Ingegerd</author><author>Murén, Eva</author><author>Gustafson, Ulla</author><author>Starkey, Mike</author><author>Borge, Kaja Sverdrup</author><author>Lingaas, Frode</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Saellström, Sara</author><author>Rönnberg, Henrik</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-Wide Analysis Identifies Germ-Line Risk Factors Associated with Canine  Mammary Tumours.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006029</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Proteins</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins</keyword><keyword>RNA, Small Nucleolar</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27158822</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1006029</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine mammary tumours (CMT) are the most common neoplasia in unspayed female  dogs. CMTs are suitable naturally occurring models for human breast cancer and share many characteristics, indicating that the genetic causes could also be shared. We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in English Springer Spaniel dogs and identified a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 11 (praw = 5.6x10-7, pperm = 0.019). The most associated haplotype spans a 446 kb region overlapping the CDK5RAP2 gene. The CDK5RAP2 protein has a function in cell cycle regulation and could potentially have an impact on response to chemotherapy treatment. Two additional loci, both on chromosome 27, were nominally associated (praw = 1.97x10-5 and praw = 8.30x10-6). The three loci explain 28.1±10.0% of the phenotypic variation seen in the cohort, whereas the top ten associated regions account for 38.2±10.8% of the risk. Furthermore, the ten GWAS loci and regions with reduced genetic variability are significantly enriched for snoRNAs and tumour-associated antigen genes, suggesting a role for these genes in CMT development. We have identified several candidate genes associated with canine mammary tumours, including CDK5RAP2. Our findings enable further comparative studies to investigate the genes and pathways in human breast cancer patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Denyer, A L</author><author>Massey, J P</author><author>Davison, L J</author><author>Ollier, W E R</author><author>Catchpole, B</author><author>Kennedy, L J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II haplotypes and risk of canine diabetes  mellitus in specific dog breeds.</title><secondary-title>Canine medicine and genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine medicine and genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>15</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33292601</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-020-00093-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disease in  domestic dogs. A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of relative or absolute insulin deficiency, including immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. DM risk varies considerably between different dog breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved and contribute susceptibility or protection. Associations of particular dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II haplotypes with DM have been identified, but investigations to date have only considered all breeds pooled together. The aim of this study was to analyse an expanded data set so as to identify breed-specific diabetes-associated DLA haplotypes. METHODS: The 12 most highly represented breeds in the UK Canine Diabetes Register were selected for study. DLA-typing data from 646 diabetic dogs and 912 breed-matched non-diabetic controls were analysed to enable breed-specific analysis of the DLA. Dogs were genotyped for allelic variation at DLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1 loci using DNA sequence-based typing. Genotypes from all three loci were combined to reveal three-locus DLA class II haplotypes, which were evaluated for statistical associations with DM. This was performed for each breed individually and for all breeds pooled together. RESULTS: Five dog breeds were identified as having one or more DLA haplotype associated with DM susceptibility or protection. Four DM-associated haplotypes were identified in the Cocker Spaniel breed, of which one haplotype was shared with Border Terriers. In the three breeds known to be at highest risk of DM included in the study (Samoyed, Tibetan Terrier and Cairn Terrier), no DLA haplotypes were found to be associated with DM. CONCLUSIONS: Novel DLA associations with DM in specific dog breeds provide further evidence that immune response genes contribute susceptibility to this disease in some cases. It is also apparent that DLA may not be contributing obvious or strong risk for DM in some breeds, including the seven breeds analysed for which no associations were identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mastrangelo, Salvatore</author><author>Biscarini, Filippo</author><author>Tolone, Marco</author><author>Auzino, Barbara</author><author>Ragatzu, Marco</author><author>Spaterna, Andrea</author><author>Ciampolini, Roberta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic characterization of the Braque Français type Pyrénées dog and  relationship with other breeds.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0208548</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bayes Theorem</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Genetics, Population</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Linkage Disequilibrium</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Population Density</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30517199</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0208548</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The evaluation of genetic variability is a useful research tool for the correct  management of selection and conservation strategies in dog breeds. In addition to pedigree genealogies, genomic data allow a deeper knowledge of the variability and genetic structure of populations. To date, many dog breeds, such as small regional breeds, still remain uncharacterized. Braque Français type Pyrénées (BRA) is a dog breed originating from a very old type of gun-dog used for pointing the location of game birds to hunters. Despite the ancient background, the knowledge about levels of genetic diversity, degree of inbreeding and population structure is scarce. This may raise concerns on the possibility that few inbred bloodlines may dominate the breed, and on its future health. The aim of this work was therefore to provide a high-resolution representation of the genome-wide diversity and population structure of BRA dogs, using the 170K genome-wide SNP array. Genome-wide polymorphisms in BRA were compared with those of other worldwide dog breeds. Between-dog relationships estimated from genomic data were very similar to pedigree relationships (Pearson correlation rg,a = 0.92). Results showed that BRA generally presents moderate levels of genetic diversity when compared with the major canine breeds. The estimated effective population size (recent Ne = 51) shows a similar declining pattern over generations as all other dog breeds, pointing at a common demographic history of modern canine breeds, clearly different from the demography of feral wolves. Multidimensional scaling (MDS), Bayesian clustering and Neighbor Joining tree were used to visualize and explore the genetic relationships among breeds, and revealed that BRA was highly differentiated and presented only low levels of admixture with other breeds. Brittany Spaniel, English Setter, Gordon Setter and Weimaraner dogs are the closest breeds to BRA. The exact reason for BRA being so divergent from other dog breeds, based on these results, is not yet clear. Further studies including additional ≪braccoid≫ breeds will be needed to refine the results presented here and to investigate the origin of the BRA breed. Nonetheless, the genome-wide characterization reported here provides a comprehensive insight into the genome diversity and population structure of the Braque Français, type Pyrénées breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomsen, Barbara</author><author>Garosi, Laurent</author><author>Skerritt, Geoff</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Sparrow, Tim</author><author>Berendt, Mette</author><author>Gredal, Hanne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neurological signs in 23 dogs with suspected rostral cerebellar ischaemic stroke.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>40</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ataxia</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Stroke</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27267355</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13028-016-0219-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In dogs with ischaemic stroke, a very common site of infarction is  the cerebellum.

RESULTS: Twenty-three dogs, 13 females and 10 males with a median age of 8 years and 8 months, were included in the study. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (n = 9) was a commonly represented breed. All ischaemic strokes were located to the vascular territory of the rostral cerebellar artery including four extensive and 19 limited occlusions. The most prominent neurological deficits were gait abnormalities (ataxia with hypermetria n = 11, ataxia without hypermetria n = 4, non-ambulatory n = 6), head tilt (n = 13), nystagmus (n = 8), decreased menace response (n = 7), postural reaction deficits (n = 7), and proprioceptive deficits (n = 5). Neurological signs appeared irrespective of the infarct being classified as extensive or limited. All dogs survived and were discharged within 1-10 days of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Dogs affected by rostral cerebellar ischaemic stroke typically present with a collection of neurological deficits characterised by ataxia, head tilt, and nystagmus irrespective of the specific cerebellar infarct topography. In dogs with peracute to acute onset of these neurological deficits, cerebellar ischaemic stroke should be considered an important differential diagnosis, and neuroimaging investigations are indicated. Although dogs are often severely compromised at presentation, short-term prognosis is excellent and rapid clinical improvement may be observed within the first week following the ischaemic stroke.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Julien, Martha E</author><author>Schechtmann, Simone A</author><author>Michau, Tammy M</author><author>Welihozkiy, Anja</author><author>Baldwin, Terri L</author><author>Stine, Jessica M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pharmacologic ciliary body ablation for chronic glaucoma in dogs: A retrospective  review of 108 eyes from 2013 to 2018.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>125-130</pages><volume>24 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Ablation Techniques</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ciliary Body</keyword><keyword>Dexamethasone</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gentamicins</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Intravitreal Injections</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp;  derivatives</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32857917</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12816</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome and efficacy of intravitreal  injection of gentamicin and dexamethasone sodium phosphate (IVGD) or triamcinolone in end-stage glaucoma patients and determine pre-procedure prognostic indicators of success and post-operative complications. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed for 108 dogs (108 eyes) treated with intravitreal gentamicin with or without dexamethasone sodium phosphate or triamcinolone for glaucoma between 2013 and 2018 with 3 months of minimum follow-up. Signalment and clinical findings, including type of glaucoma, pre-procedure intraocular pressure (IOP), chronicity, procedure protocol, and outcome were recorded. Success was defined as an intraocular pressure of ≤25 mm Hg at the time of last re-examination or no ocular hypotensive medications at 3 months or longer post-injection. RESULTS: The overall success rate for pharmacologic ablation was 95%. The success rate for dogs receiving no ocular hypotensive medications was 86%. Seventy-six eyes (70.4%) had primary glaucoma, and 32 eyes (29.6%) had secondary glaucoma. Age at the time of injection had no effect on initial success but did in final success (P =-.03) for dogs requiring repeat injections. Cocker Spaniels required the most repeat 2nd and 3rd injections (3/12 dogs) and (2/4 dogs), respectively. No preoperative variable significantly affected the success rate. The most common complications were phthisis bulbi (59.2%), corneal edema (25.9%), and ulcerative keratitis (22.3%). Uncontrolled IOP resulted in enucleation in two dogs (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacologic ablation has a high overall success rate in lowering IOP to ≤25 mm Hg short-term in blind, glaucomatous canine eyes. Type of glaucoma, pre-procedure IOP, chronicity, and protocol did not affect success.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burgess, K</author><author>Moore, A</author><author>Rand, W</author><author>Cotter, S M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treatment of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in dogs with cyclophosphamide.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>456-462</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide</keyword><keyword>Disease-Free Survival</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drug Administration Schedule</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Massachusetts</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10935898</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2000)014&lt;0456:toihai&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A review of 60 cases of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in the dog was  performed in order to characterize the disease and to identify potential prognostic indicators. Dogs ranged in age from 1 to 13 years, with a mean age of 6.5 years. The 2 most commonly affected breeds were Cocker Spaniels and Labrador Retrievers. Fifty-two of the 60 dogs tested (87%) were autoagglutination positive and spherocytes were present in 45 (75%). Forty-one (89%) of 46 patients tested positive for the presence of immunoglobulin on the red blood cell surface (Coombs assay). The most common clinical signs at presentation were lethargy, weakness, pale mucous membranes, icterus, hemoglobinuria, and anorexia. PCV less than 25% was present in 59 (98%) dogs. At the time of presentation, 35 dogs (58%) had a nonregenerative anemia, whereas 25 patients (42%) had a regenerative response. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 41 (68%) dogs. Nine of 34 dogs (26%) had a prolonged prothrombin time, 19 of 34 (56%) had a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin clotting time, and 12 of 34 (35%) had abnormal fibrinogen concentrations. All dogs received prednisone at immunosuppressive doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg PO as a single or divided dose every 24 hours) and cyclophosphamide as primary therapy. Forty-one dogs (63%) received cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/m2 q24h for 4 days, whereas 9 dogs (15%) received an initial high dose (200 mg/m2) followed by 3 days of a lower dose (50 mg/m2 q24h). No statistical difference in survival times was found for either protocol. Thirteen dogs were treated with azathioprine in addition to cyclophosphamide and prednisone. The median survival time of dogs that received all 3 drugs was 370 days as compared to 9 days for those dogs that were treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisone alone. Thirty-one (52%) dogs died from the disease, 13 (22%) dogs were alive, and 15 (25%) dogs were lost to follow-up. The median length of survival for all dogs was 21 days. Eight dogs that were discharged from the hospital suffered a relapse (PCV &lt; 25%).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Dohee</author><author>Yun, Taesik</author><author>Koo, Yoonhoi</author><author>Chae, Yeon</author><author>Chang, Dongwoo</author><author>Yang, Mhan-Pyo</author><author>Kang, Byeong-Teck</author><author>Kim, Hakhyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>18F-FDG PET/CT image findings of a dog with adrenocortical carcinoma.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>15</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Adrenocortical Carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fluorodeoxyglucose F18</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography</keyword><keyword>Positron-Emission Tomography</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34980137</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-021-03102-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In human medicine, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission  tomography (PET) has been used to differentiate between benign and malignant adrenal tumors and to identify metastases. However, canine adrenocortical carcinomas identified by 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) have not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old, castrated male, Cocker Spaniel dog with severe systolic hypertension exhibited an adrenal mass approximately 3.6 cm in diameter on ultrasonography. There was no evidence of pulmonary metastasis or vascular invasion on thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, respectively. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed to identify the characteristics of the adrenal mass and the state of metastasis. One hour after injection of 5.46 MBq/kg 18F-FDG intravenously, the peripheral region of the adrenal mass visually revealed an increased 18F-FDG uptake, which was higher than that of the liver, and the central region of the mass exhibited necrosis. The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) of the adrenal mass was 3.24; and relative SUV, calculated by dividing the maximal SUV of the adrenal tumor by the mean SUV of the normal liver, was 5.23. Adrenocortical carcinoma was tentatively diagnosed and surgical adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination of the resected adrenal mass revealed the characteristics of an adrenocortical carcinoma. After adrenalectomy, systolic blood pressure reduced to below 150 mmHg without any medication. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of 18F-FDG PET/CT findings in a dog with suspected adrenocortical carcinoma and may provide valuable diagnostic information for adrenocortical carcinoma in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parisi, Carmelo</author><author>Phillips, Victoria</author><author>Ferreira, Jacques</author><author>Linney, Chris</author><author>Mair, Alastair</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anaesthetic management and complications of transvascular patent ductus  arteriosus occlusion in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</full-title></periodical><pages>581-587</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Analgesics</keyword><keyword>Anesthesia</keyword><keyword>Anesthetics</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypnotics and Sedatives</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Therapeutic Occlusion</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32792269</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaa.2020.01.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyse the anaesthetic management, complications  and haemodynamic changes in a cohort of dogs undergoing transvascular patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occlusion in a tertiary referral centre (from January 2017 to August 2018). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: A total of 49 client-owned dogs. METHODS: Anaesthetic records of dogs with PDA that underwent transvascular occlusion of the ductus were reviewed. Anaesthetic complications evaluated included tachycardia [heart rate (HR) &gt; 160 beats minute(-1)], bradycardia (HR &lt; 50 beats minute(-1)), hypertension [systolic arterial pressure (SAP) &gt; 150 mmHg], hypotension [mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt; 60 mmHg], hypothermia (&lt;37 °C) and the presence of arrhythmias. Cardiovascular variables [HR and invasive SAP, MAP and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP)] at the time of occlusion device deployment (time 0) were compared with variables at 5 and 10 minutes after deployment. Descriptive statistics, Shapiro-Wilk test and repeated measures analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett's post hoc test were used to analyse the data (p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: Crossbreed dogs were the most commonly represented followed by the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The median age was 8 (2-108) months, and female dogs were over-represented (65.3%). The most common American Society of Anesthesiologists score was III. Mean duration of anaesthesia was 96 ± 26 minutes and mean surgery time was 58 ± 21 minutes. Acepromazine with methadone was the most commonly used premedication combination (77.6%). Propofol was the most common induction agent (73.5%). General anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen in all dogs. Complications included hypotension (63%), hypothermia (34%), bradycardia (28%), arrhythmias (16%), hypertension (16%) and haemorrhage (2%). MAP and DAP increased significantly 10 minutes after device deployment compared with time 0. CONCLUSIONS: and clinical relevance: Hypotension was the most common complication reported in dogs undergoing transvascular PDA occlusion. No major adverse events were documented.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macho, Luis P</author><author>Center, Sharon A</author><author>Randolph, John F</author><author>Dumars, Lee Ann</author><author>Rush, Susan E</author><author>Cameron, Mary Kate</author><author>Lucy, John M</author><author>Hall-Fonte, Deborah L</author><author>McDonough, Sean P</author><author>Peters-Kennedy, Jeanine</author><author>Marinoff, Jacqueline</author><author>Harrison, Jennifer</author><author>Sabatino, Bethany</author><author>Deitz, Krysta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical, clinicopathologic, and hepatic histopathologic features associated with  probable ketoconazole-induced liver injury in dogs: 15 cases (2015-2018).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1245-1256</pages><volume>256</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ketoconazole</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32412870</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.256.11.1245</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinical, clinicopathologic, and hepatic  histopathologic features and outcome for dogs with probable ketoconazole-induced liver injury. ANIMALS: 15 dogs with suspected ketoconazole-induced liver injury that underwent liver biopsy. PROCEDURES: Medical record data were summarized regarding signalment, clinical signs, clinicopathologic and hepatic histopathologic findings, concurrent medications, ketoconazole dose, treatment duration, and outcome. RESULTS: Median age and body weight were 8.2 years (range, 5 to 15 years) and 13.0 kg (28.6 lb; range, 8.2 to 38.0 kg [18.0 to 83.6 lb]), respectively. The most common breed was Cocker Spaniel (n = 5). All dogs received ketoconazole to treat cutaneous Malassezia infections. Median daily ketoconazole dose was 7.8 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb; range, 4.4 to 26.0 mg/kg [2.0 to 11.8 mg/lb]), PO. Treatment duration ranged from 0.3 to 100 cumulative weeks (intermittent cyclic administration in some dogs); 6 dogs were treated for ≤ 10 days. Common clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. All dogs developed high serum liver enzyme activities. Hepatic histopathologic findings included variable lobular injury, mixed inflammatory infiltrates, and conspicuous aggregates of ceroid-lipofuscin-engorged macrophages that marked regions of parenchymal damage. Five dogs developed chronic hepatitis, including 3 with pyogranulomatous inflammation. Of the 10 dogs reported to have died at last follow-up, survival time after illness onset ranged from 0.5 to 165 weeks, with 7 dogs dying of liver-related causes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings for dogs with hepatotoxicosis circumstantially associated with ketoconazole treatment suggested proactive monitoring of serum liver enzyme activities is advisable before and sequentially after initiation of such treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olivieri, Emanuela</author><author>Zanzani, Sergio Aurelio</author><author>Gazzonis, Alessia Libera</author><author>Giudice, Chiara</author><author>Brambilla, Paola</author><author>Alberti, Isa</author><author>Romussi, Stefano</author><author>Lombardo, Rocco</author><author>Mortellaro, Carlo Maria</author><author>Banco, Barbara</author><author>Vanzulli, Federico Maria</author><author>Veronesi, Fabrizia</author><author>Manfredi, Maria Teresa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in dogs from a cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis  endemic area of Northwestern Italy: a case study and a retrospective data analysis.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>165</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiostrongylus</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Errors</keyword><keyword>Dirofilariasis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Diseases</keyword><keyword>Lung Diseases, Parasitic</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Strongylida Infections</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28592295</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-017-1083-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In Italy, Angiostrongylus vasorum, an emergent parasite, is being  diagnosed in dogs from areas considered free of infection so far. As clinical signs are multiple and common to other diseases, its diagnosis can be challenging. In particular, in areas where angiostrongylosis and dirofilariosis overlap, a misleading diagnosis of cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis might occur even on the basis of possible misleading outcomes from diagnostic kits. CASE PRESENTATION: Two Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs from an Italian breeding in the Northwest were referred to a private veterinary hospital with respiratory signs. A cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis was diagnosed and the dogs treated with ivermectin, but one of them died. At necropsy, pulmonary oedema, enlargement of tracheo-bronchial lymphnodes and of cardiac right side were detected. Within the right ventricle lumen, adults of A. vasorum were found. All dogs from the same kennel were subjected to faecal examination by FLOTAC and Baermann's techniques to detect A. vasorum first stage larvae; blood analysis by Knott's for Dirofilaria immitis microfilariae, and antigenic tests for both A. vasorum (Angio Detect™) and D.immitis (DiroCHEK® Heartworm, Witness®Dirofilaria). The surviving dog with respiratory signs resulted positive for A. vasorum both at serum antigens and larval detection. Its Witness® test was low positive similarly to other four dogs from the same kennel, but false positive results due to cross reactions with A. vasorum were also considered. No dogs were found infected by A. vasorum. Eventually, the investigation was deepened by browsing the pathological database of Veterinary Pathology Laboratories at Veterinary School of Milan University through 1998-2016, where 11 cases of angiostrongylosis were described. Two out of 11 dogs had a mixed infection with Crenosoma vulpis. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the need for accurate surveys to acquire proper epidemiological data on A. vasorum infection in Northwestern Italy and for appropriate diagnostic methods. Veterinary clinicians should be warned about the occurrence of this canine parasite and the connected risk of a misleading diagnosis, particularly in areas endemic for cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ireifej, Shadi</author><author>Marino, Dominic</author><author>Loughin, Catherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nano total hip replacement in 12 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>130-135</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Femur</keyword><keyword>Femur Head Necrosis</keyword><keyword>Fractures, Bone</keyword><keyword>Hip Dysplasia, Canine</keyword><keyword>Joint Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23253038</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950X.2011.00939.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term clinical outcome of nano total hip  replacement (NanoTHR) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Dogs (n = 12). METHODS: Medical records (2009-2011) of dogs that had nano-THR were reviewed for signalment, weight, clinical signs, side, age, prosthesis sizes, concurrent surgeries performed, complications, operative time, 3-month postoperative pelvic radiograph results, and lameness scores. RESULTS: Breeds were Yorkshire Terriers (n = 6), Toy Poodles (2), with 1 each of Maltese, Pomeranian, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and Shih-Tzu. Median body was 4.87 kg (range, 2.5-5.90 kg) and median age, 35.75 months (range, 12-144 months). Radiographs were taken in 4 dogs at 12 days (n = 2), 14 days (1), and 30 days (1) after surgery because of presentation for an acute grade 5 lameness. Three dogs had femoral fractures distal to the femoral implant tip and 1 dog displaced the acetabular implant medially. After revision surgery, all femoral fractures were assessed as healed with intact plate fixation. The dog with the medially displaced acetabular component responded to conservative management including strict confinement and analgesic administration. Eight dogs (58%) were assigned a grade 1 lameness and 4 dogs were grade 2 (33%) at 12-week examination. The 3 dogs with grade 5 lameness scores found to have femoral fractures within 1 month after surgery, subsequently improved to grade 1 (n = 1) and 2 (2) 12 weeks after revision surgery. The dog with medial acetabular displacement improved to a grade 2 lameness 12 weeks after conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: Although all 12 dogs had good-to-excellent outcomes, 33% experienced significant complications associated with the technique. As improvements in instrumentation and refinements in the technique are developed, NanoTHR can be considered an alternative to the femoral head and neck ostectomy (FHO) or medical management of coxofemoral disease for toy breed dogs. Further studies with a larger number of dogs and longer follow-up times are required.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vora, S</author><author>Giger, U</author><author>Turchen, S</author><author>Harvey, J W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of the enzymatic lesion in inherited phosphofructokinase  deficiency in the dog: an animal analogue of human glycogen storage disease type VII.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>8109-8113</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Erythrocytes</keyword><keyword>Glycogen</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Storage Disease</keyword><keyword>Immunologic Techniques</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Muscles</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinase-1</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year></dates><accession-num>2933748</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.82.23.8109</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Mammalian phosphofructokinase (PFK; ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate  1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) exists in multimolecular forms, which result from random tetramerization of three distinct subunits, M (muscle-type), L (liver-type), and P (platelet-type), each under a separate genetic control. Human muscle and liver contain homotetramers M4 and L4, respectively, whereas erythrocytes contain a mixture of M4, M3L, M2L2, ML3, and L4 isozymes. Homozygous deficiency of the M subunit in man results in glycogen storage disease (GSD) type VII, which is characterized by exertional muscle weakness and compensated hemolysis; the residual erythrocyte PFK consists of isolated L4 isozyme. Recently, PFK deficiency associated with isolated hemolytic anemia has been identified among English springer spaniel dogs. We investigated the genetic control of the dog PFK system and the nature of the enzymatic defect in two PFK-deficient animals, using chromatographic and immunological techniques. Our studies indicate the existence of a trilocus isozyme system for the dog, as is the case with other mammals. Muscle PFK consists of M4 isozyme, whereas the predominant species of liver and platelet consists, respectively, of the L4 and P4 isozyme; erythrocyte PFK consists of a three- or four-membered set composed of M and P subunits. PFK deficiency in the dogs was found to result from a total and universal lack of the M subunit, as is the case in man. However, the probands consistently exhibited L4 isozyme in their muscle; P4, L4, and hybrids thereof in their erythrocytes; and an increase in the L-containing isozymes in their platelets, indicating a generalized anomalous presence of the L subunit. The apparent absence of muscle disease in these animals is most likely accounted for by both the well-known high oxidative potential of the canine muscle in general and the presence of liver PFK in the M-deficient muscle in particular. In contrast, presence of hemolysis despite residual P4 and hybrids of P and L in the erythrocytes may be inferred to result in severe glycolytic handicap under existing intraerythrocytic conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driesbaugh, Kathryn H</author><author>Branchetti, Emanuela</author><author>Grau, Juan B</author><author>Keeney, Samuel J</author><author>Glass, Kimberly</author><author>Oyama, Mark A</author><author>Rioux, Nancy</author><author>Ayoub, Salma</author><author>Sacks, Michael S</author><author>Quackenbush, John</author><author>Levy, Robert J</author><author>Ferrari, Giovanni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serotonin receptor 2B signaling with interstitial cell activation and leaflet  remodeling in degenerative mitral regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>94-103</pages><volume>115</volume><keywords><keyword>Angiotensin II</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomechanical Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Organic Chemicals</keyword><keyword>Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2B</keyword><keyword>Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29291394</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.12.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>AIMS: Mitral valve interstitial cells (MVIC) play an important role in the  pathogenesis of degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Numerous clinical studies have observed serotonin (5HT) dysregulation in cardiac valvulopathies; however, the impact of 5HT-mediated signaling on MVIC activation and leaflet remodeling in MVP have been investigated to a limited extent. Here we test the hypothesis that 5HT receptors (5HTRs) signaling contributes to MVP pathophysiology. METHODS AND RESULTS: Diseased human MV leaflets were obtained during cardiac surgery for MVP; normal MV leaflets were obtained from heart transplants. MV RNA was used for microarray analysis of MVP patients versus control, highlighting genes that indicate the involvement of 5HTR pathways and extracellular matrix remodeling in MVP. Human MV leaflets were also studied in vitro and ex vivo with biomechanical testing to assess remodeling in the presence of a 5HTR2B antagonist (LY272015). MVP leaflets from Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were used as a naturally acquired in vivo model of MVP. These canine MVP leaflets (N=5/group) showed 5HTR2B upregulation. This study also utilized CB57.1ML/6 mice in order to determine the effect of Angiotensin II infusion on MV remodeling. Histological analysis showed that MV thickening due to chronic Angiotensin II remodeling is mitigated by a 5HTR2B antagonist (LY272015) but not by 5HTR2A inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In humans, MVP is associated with an upregulation in 5HTR2B expression and increased 5HT receptor signaling in the leaflets. Antagonism of 5HTR2B mitigates MVIC activation in vitro and MV remodeling in vivo. These observations support the view that 5HTR signaling is involved not only in previously reported 5HT-related valvulopathies, but it is also involved in the pathological remodeling of MVP.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mattin, M J</author><author>Boswood, A</author><author>Church, D B</author><author>McGreevy, P D</author><author>O'Neill, D G</author><author>Thomson, P C</author><author>Brodbelt, D C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Degenerative mitral valve disease: Survival of dogs attending primary-care  practice in England.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>436-442</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26058819</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.05.007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study aimed to evaluate survival of dogs with degenerative mitral valve  disease (DMVD). A retrospective cohort study of dogs with DMVD attending primary-care practices in England was undertaken. Cases of DMVD were identified within the electronic patient records (EPRs) of practices sharing data with VetCompass. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to explore survival and Cox regression models identified factors associated with hazard of death. The EPRs from 111,967 dogs, attending 93 veterinary practices between January 2010 and December 2011 identified 405 cases diagnosed with DMVD giving a prevalence of diagnosed DMVD of 0.36% (95% CI: 0.29-0.45%). A further 3557 dogs were classified as possible cases (heart murmurs consistent with DMVD). Overall, a total of 3962 dogs were classified as heart murmur cases (possible and diagnosed DMVD), giving a prevalence of 3.54% (95% CI: 3.26-3.84%). One hundred and sixteen (28.6%) of the diagnosed DMVD cases were incident, newly diagnosed with DMVD. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.52 years (95% CI: 8.98-10.14 years). Fifty-eight (50.0%) of the incident cases died during the study period. The median survival time (MST) for all-cause mortality was 25.4 months (95% CI: 20.4-34.4 months) after disease detection for DMVD cases. For possible cases, 121 (29.7%) from a random sample of 407 possible DMVD cases were incident cases (newly detected heart murmur consistent with DMVD during the study period). The mean age at which a heart murmur was first recorded in possible cases was 9.73 years (95% CI: 9.02-10.44 years). Forty-nine (40.5%) possible cases died during the study period. The MST for all-cause mortality was 33.8 months (95% CI: 23.7-43.1 months) after a heart murmur was initially detected. In the multivariable survival analysis for possible and diagnosed cases, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and other purebreds had higher hazards of death than crossbreds. Dogs weighing ≥20.0kg and older dogs had an increased hazard of death compared with those &lt;20.0kg and younger dogs, respectively. The study highlights poorer survival for all-cause mortality in CKCSs and larger dogs. The reported survival characteristics could aid veterinary surgeons' advice on the prognosis for dogs with DMVD and help the assessment of the impact of the condition at a population level.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sirivisoot, Sirintra</author><author>Kasantikul, Tanit</author><author>Techangamsuwan, Somporn</author><author>Radtanakatikanon, Araya</author><author>Chen, Ken</author><author>Lin, Tzu-Yin</author><author>Rungsipipat, Anudep</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms in canine diffuse large B-cell  lymphomas using MassARRAY.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>5120</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Doxorubicin</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Prednisone</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3</keyword><keyword>Vincristine</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35332215</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-022-09112-0</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of lymphoma in  dogs with a multicentric form. This study aimed to assemble 41 variants of the previously reported genes and to investigate these variants in canine DLBCL using the Agena MassARRAY platform. These variants were chosen based on the high prevalence observed in canine B- and T-cell lymphomas, their significance for target therapy, and compatibility for multiplex PCR amplification. Lymph node biopsy was performed from 60 dogs with B-cell lymphoma comprising 47 purebred and 13 crossbred dogs. All dogs presented single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at HYAL4 and SATB1 genes. The lesser mutual SNPs were observed at SEL1L, excluding a cocker spaniel, and c-Kit, with the exception of a pug and a French bulldog. Even though no statistical association was noted between each SNP and dog breed, purebreds were 3.88 times more likely to have a SNP at FLT3 rs852342480 (95%CI 0.50-45.03, p = 0.26), 3.64 times at TRAF3 F306X (95%CI 0.58-42.50, p = 0.43) and 2.66 times at TRAF3 E303EX (95%CI 0.56-13.12, p = 0.31). Also, DLBCL dogs (CHOP-based treatment) with c-Kit T425= had a poorer prognosis with shorter median overall survival times (OST) than dogs with the wild type. Dogs treated with COP chemotherapy and contained 3-5 variants at SEL1L were associated with decreased median OST. Therefore, this SNP's lymphoma panel provides valuable information that we can use to outline a prognosis and develop a treatment plan for the targeted therapy of each dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Yin, Yahui</author><author>Tetas Pont, Roser</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Pegram, Camilla</author><author>Mustikka, Minna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed and conformational predispositions for prolapsed nictitating membrane gland  (PNMG) in dogs in the UK: A VetCompass study.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0260538</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Disease Susceptibility</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eyelid Diseases</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Nictitating Membrane</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35081121</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0260538</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Prolapsed nictitating membrane gland (PNMG) is the most common  disorder of the third eyelid in dogs. However, the epidemiology of PNMG in the wider dog population remains understudied. METHODS: Using de-identified clinical data from the VetCompass Programme, this cohort study aimed to report the prevalence, demographic and breed-related risk factors of PNMG in dogs attending UK primary care veterinary practices in 2016. RESULTS: There were 1,802 PNMG cases identified from 905,543 dogs, yielding an annual prevalence of 0.20% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.21). The median age at first diagnosis was 0.63 years (IQR 0.33-1.98, range 0.11-18.00). Dogs aged under 1 year had 10.82 times the odds (95% CI 9.17-12.76) compared with dogs aged from 2 to under 4 years. Neutered animals had higher odds than entire animals within both sexes. Breeds with the highest odds of PNMG compared with crossbred dogs included Neapolitan Mastiff (odds ratio (OR) 34.26, 95%CI 15.92-73.75), English Bulldog (OR 24.08, 95% CI 20.62-28.13), Cane Corso (OR 14.66, 95% CI 8.18-26.28), Lhasa Apso (OR 12.37, 95% CI 10.26-14.92) and American Cocker Spaniel (OR 11.57, 95% CI 5.59-23.96). Purebred dogs had 1.43 times the odds (95% CI 1.26-1.63) of PNMG compared with crossbreed dogs. Breeds with brachycephalic skull conformation had 6.71 times the odds (95%CI 5.89-7.64) compared with breeds with mesocephalic skull conformation. Insured dogs had 1.89 times the odds (95% CI 1.65-2.16) compared with uninsured dogs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the largest cohort of primary-care PNMG cases assembled to date. The results showing young age at diagnosis along with the breed, purebred and brachycephalic skull conformation predispositions suggest a hereditary involvement in PNMG development. These results may help to guide breeding strategies to reduce the prevalence of PNMG and improve welfare in predisposed individuals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brambilla, Paola Giuseppina</author><author>Polli, Michele</author><author>Pradelli, Danitza</author><author>Papa, Melissa</author><author>Rizzi, Rita</author><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Bussadori, Claudio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological study of congenital heart diseases in dogs: Prevalence,  popularity, and volatility throughout twenty years of clinical practice.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0230160</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Defects, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Heart Septal Defects, Atrial</keyword><keyword>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Valve Stenosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32716943</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0230160</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The epidemiology of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) has changed over the past  twenty years. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CHDs in the population of dogs recruited in a single referral center (RC); compare the epidemiological features of CHDs in screened breeds (Boxers) versus non-screened (French and English Bulldogs, German Shepherds); investigate the association of breeds with the prevalence of CHDs; determine the popularity and volatility of breeds over a 20-year period; analysed the trends of the most popular breeds in the overall population of new-born dogs registered in the Italian Kennel Club (IKC) from 1st January 1997 to 31st December 2017. The RC's cardiological database was analysed, and 1,779 clinical records were included in a retrospective observation study. Descriptive statistics and frequencies regarding the most representative breeds and CHDs were generated. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the trends of the most common CHDs found in single and in cluster of breeds. The relationship between breed popularity and presence of CHDs was studied. The most common CHDs were Pulmonic Stenosis, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Subaortic Stenosis, Ventricular Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis, Tricuspid Dysplasia, Atrial Septal Defect, Double Chamber Right Ventricle, Mitral Dysplasia, and others less frequent. The most represented pure breeds were Boxer, German Shepherd, French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Maltese, Newfoundland, Rottweiler, Golden Retriever, Chihuahua, and others in lower percentage. Chihuahuas, American Staffordshire Terriers, Border Collies, French Bulldogs, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel were the most appreciated all of which showed a high value of volatility. This study found evidence for the value of the screening program implemented in Boxers; fashions and trends influence dog owners' choices more than the worries of health problems in a breed. Effective breeding programs are needed in order to control the diffusion of CHDs without impoverishing the genetic pool.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Boswood, A</author><author>O'Grady, M</author><author>Jöns, O</author><author>Smith, S</author><author>Swift, S</author><author>Borgarelli, M</author><author>Gavaghan, B</author><author>Kresken, J-G</author><author>Patteson, M</author><author>Ablad, B</author><author>Bussadori, C M</author><author>Glaus, T</author><author>Kovacević, A</author><author>Rapp, M</author><author>Santilli, R A</author><author>Tidholm, A</author><author>Eriksson, A</author><author>Belanger, M C</author><author>Deinert, M</author><author>Little, C J L</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>French, A</author><author>Rønn-Landbo, M</author><author>Wess, G</author><author>Eggertsdottir, A V</author><author>O'Sullivan, M L</author><author>Schneider, M</author><author>Lombard, C W</author><author>Dukes-McEwan, J</author><author>Willis, R</author><author>Louvet, A</author><author>DiFruscia, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of pimobendan or benazepril hydrochloride on survival times in dogs with  congestive heart failure caused by naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease: the QUEST study.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1124-1135</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzazepines</keyword><keyword>Cardiotonic Agents</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Multivariate Analysis</keyword><keyword>Proportional Hazards Models</keyword><keyword>Pyridazines</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18638016</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0150.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) continues to be an important  cause of morbidity and mortality in geriatric dogs despite conventional therapy. HYPOTHESIS: Pimobendan in addition to conventional therapy will extend time to sudden cardiac death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure when compared with conventional therapy plus benazepril in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) attributable to MMVD. ANIMALS: Two hundred and sixty client-owned dogs in CHF caused by MMVD were recruited from 28 centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia. METHODS: A prospective single-blinded study with dogs randomized to PO receive pimobendan (0.4-0.6 mg/kg/d) or benazepril hydrochloride (0.25-1.0 mg/kg/d). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, euthanized for heart failure, or treatment failure. RESULTS: Eight dogs were excluded from analysis. One hundred and twenty-four dogs were randomized to pimobendan and 128 to benazepril. One hundred and ninety dogs reached the primary endpoint; the median time was 188 days (267 days for pimobendan, 140 days for benazepril hazard ratio = 0.688, 95% confidence limits [CL]=0.516-0.916, P= .0099). The benefit of pimobendan persisted after adjusting for all baseline variables. A longer time to reach the endpoint was also associated with being a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, requiring a lower furosemide dose, and having a higher creatinine concentration. Increases in several indicators of cardiac enlargement (left atrial to aortic root ratio, vertebral heart scale, and percentage increase in left ventricular internal diameter in systole) were associated with a shorter time to endpoint, as was a worse tolerance for exercise. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Pimobendan plus conventional therapy prolongs time to sudden death, euthanasia for cardiac reasons, or treatment failure in dogs with CHF caused by MMVD compared with benazepril plus conventional therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heilmann, Romy M</author><author>Nabity, Mary B</author><author>Bryan, Laura K</author><author>Cook, Audrey K</author><author>Scott, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mucocutaneous nasal histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent dog.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>192</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antifungal Agents</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Histoplasma</keyword><keyword>Histoplasmosis</keyword><keyword>Itraconazole</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nasal Cavity</keyword><keyword>Texas</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33985507</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-021-02896-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Histoplasma (H.) capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus, and infection is  typically via inhalation of microconidia. After conversion to the yeast phase within the lung, the organism is subsequently disseminated to other tissues by macrophages. Nasal histoplasmosis appears to be a rare condition in dogs. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical case of a 4.5-year-old male neutered Cocker spaniel/Poodle mix, 7.7 kg, body condition score 6/9, that presented with a 3-month history of sneezing and left-sided mucoid nasal discharge. The history also included a mild swelling (transient) of the right carpus with a lameness (grade II-III/IV), coinciding with the onset of sneezing and nasal discharge. The dog lived primarily indoors in the Texas Gulf Coast area. On physical examination, the dog was febrile, and the left nostril was swollen, ulcerative, deformed, and hypopigmented. Mandibular lymph nodes were firm and mildly enlarged bilaterally. Mild lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglobulinemia were noted. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Computed tomography and rhinoscopy revealed swelling of the rostral portion of the left and right nasal passages. Cytology and histology of biopsies of the affected nasal tissue showed pyogranulomatous inflammation and yeast organisms consistent with H. capsulatum. Weak antigenuria was detected on the MVista H. capsulatum antigen test. Treatment with oral itraconazole led to a resolution of the nasal signs and normalization of the appearance of the nostril over 13 weeks, and neither antigenuria nor antigenemia was detected on several recheck examinations. The dog remained in good general and physical condition and showed no signs of disease recurrence more than 6 years after the last examination. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of nasal mucocutaneous histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent dog, with an excellent clinical response to oral itraconazole. This case documents that histoplasmosis in dogs can affect primarily the nasal cavity, which responds rapidly to triazole antifungal therapy and has a good prognosis. A similar case has only been reported in human medicine in a young adult.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Langer, Pierre</author><author>Black, Cameron</author><author>Egan, Padraig</author><author>Fitzpatrick, Noel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treatment of calvarial defects by resorbable and non-resorbable sonic activated  polymer pins and mouldable titanium mesh in two dogs: a case report.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>199</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Screws</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Frontal Bone</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polymers</keyword><keyword>Skull Fractures</keyword><keyword>Skull Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Surgical Mesh</keyword><keyword>Titanium</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29929513</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-018-1506-0</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: To date, calvarial defects in dogs have traditionally been addressed  with different types of implants including bone allograft, polymethylmethacrylate and titanium mesh secured with conventional metallic fixation methods. This report describes the use of an absorbable and non absorbable novel polymer fixation method, Bonewelding® technology, in combination with titanium mesh for the repair of calvarial defects in two dogs. The clinical outcomes and comparative complication using resorbable and non-resorbable thermoplastic pins were compared. CASE PRESENTATION: This report of two cases documents the repair of a traumatic calvarial fracture in an adult male Greyhound and a cranioplasty following frontal bone tumor resection in an adult female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with the use of a commercially available titanium mesh secured with an innovative thermoplastic polymer screw system (Bonewelding®). The treatment combination aimed to restore cranial structure, sinus integrity and cosmetic appearance. A mouldable titanium mesh was cut to fit the bone defect of the frontal bone and secured with either resorbable or non-resorbable polymer pins using Bonewelding® technology. Gentamycin-impregnated collagen sponge was used intraoperatively to assist with sealing of the frontal sinuses. Calvarial fracture and post-operative implant positioning were advised using computed tomography. A satisfactory restoration of skull integrity and cosmetic result was achieved, and long term clinical outcome was deemed clinically adequate with good patient quality of life. Postoperative complications including rostral mesh uplift with minor associated clinical signs were encountered when resorbable pins were used. No postoperative complications were experienced in non-resorbable pins at 7 months follow-up, by contrast mesh uplift was noted 3 weeks post-procedure in the case treated using absorbable pins. CONCLUSIONS: The report demonstrates the innovative use of sonic-activated polymer pins (Bonewelding® technology) alongside titanium mesh is a suitable alternative technique for skull defect repair in dogs. The use of Bonewelding® may offer advantages in reduction of surgical time. Further, ultrasonic pin application may be less invasive than alternative metallic fixation and potentially reduces bone trauma. Polymer systems may offer enhanced mesh-bone integration when compared to traditional metallic implants. The use of polymer pins demonstrates initial potential as a fixation method in cranioplasty. Initial findings in a single case comparison indicate a possible advantage in the use of non-absorbable over the absorbable systems to circumvent complications associated with variable polymer degradation, further long term studies with higher patient numbers are required before reliable conclusions can be made.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mankowska, Monika</author><author>Nowacka-Woszuk, Joanna</author><author>Graczyk, Aneta</author><author>Ciazynska, Paulina</author><author>Stachowiak, Monika</author><author>Switonski, Marek</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polymorphism and methylation of the MC4R gene in obese and non-obese dogs.</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology reports</full-title></periodical><pages>333-339</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>3' Flanking Region</keyword><keyword>Adiposity</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>DNA Methylation</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Methylation</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Overweight</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28755272</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11033-017-4114-3</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The dog is considered to be a useful biomedical model for human diseases and  disorders, including obesity. One of the numerous genes associated with human polygenic obesity is MC4R, encoding the melanocortin 4 receptor. The aim of our study was to analyze polymorphisms and methylation of the canine MC4R in relation to adiposity. Altogether 270 dogs representing four breeds predisposed to obesity: Labrador Retriever (n = 187), Golden Retriever (n = 38), Beagle (n = 28) and Cocker Spaniel (n = 17), were studied. The dogs were classified into three groups: lean, overweight and obese, according to the 5-point Body Condition Score (BCS) scale. In the cohort of Labradors a complete phenotypic data (age, sex, neutering status, body weight and BCS) were collected for 127 dogs. The entire coding sequence as well as 5' and 3'-flanking regions of the studied gene were sequenced and six polymorphic sites were reported. Genotype frequencies differed considerably between breeds and Labrador Retrievers appeared to be the less polymorphic. Moreover, distribution of some polymorphic variants differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) between small cohorts with diverse BCS in Golden Retrievers (c.777T&gt;C, c.868C&gt;T and c.*33C&gt;G) and Beagles (c.-435T&gt;C and c.637G&gt;T). On the contrary, in Labradors no association between the studied polymorphisms and BCS or body weight was observed. Methylation analysis, using bisulfite DNA conversion followed by Sanger sequencing, was carried out for 12 dogs with BCS = 3 and 12 dogs with BCS = 5. Two intragenic CpG islands, containing 19 cytosines, were analyzed and the methylation profile did not differ significantly between lean and obese animals. We conclude that an association of the MC4R gene polymorphism with dog obesity or body weight is unlikely, in spite of the fact that some associations were found in small cohorts of Beagles and Golden Retrievers. Also methylation level of this gene is not related with dog adiposity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sapienza, John S</author><author>van der Woerdt, Alexandra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combined transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation and Ahmed  gonioimplantation in dogs with primary glaucoma: 51 cases (1996-2004).</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>121-127</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma Drainage Implants</keyword><keyword>Laser Coagulation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>New York</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15762925</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00356.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the combined diode laser cycloablation procedure and  adjunctive Ahmed gonioimplant use in dogs with primary glaucoma. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 48 dogs, 51 eyes with primary glaucoma. PROCEDURE: Medical records from two large private clinical ophthalmology services were reviewed. Signalment, duration of glaucoma, gonioscopic evaluation, laser power and duration settings, immediate postoperative and final intraocular pressure and visual results, short and long-term visual outcome, and surgical complications were recorded. RESULTS: The age range of affected dogs was 3.0-14.0 years, with a mean age of 7.5 +/- 2.6 years. Eleven pure breeds were represented, with the most common being the American Cocker Spaniel. The sex distribution was 22 neutered males, 1 intact male, 23 spayed females, and 2 intact female dogs. The right eye was affected in 33 cases, and the left eye in 18 cases. The average total joules, which was administered with the diode laser, was 109.6 +/- 23.6 J. Immediate surgical complications included fibrin formation in the anterior chamber (15), corneal ulcers (4), hyphema (7), and focal retinal detachment (1). Long-term complications included cataract formation (8 total, 2 of which were significant, vision-threatening), elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (6), unstable gonioimplant (1), and glaucoma recurrence (14). Additional surgeries performed on the eyes over the course of study included: intrascleral prosthesis (4), enucleation (1), resection of fibrotic scar tissue (5), and repeat laser cycloablation (8). The dogs were examined for a mean follow-up time of 17.6 months (range: 2-83 months postoperatively). Twenty-nine cases were followed greater than one year. Vision was maintained in 42/51 eyes (82%) in the immediate short-term of this study. In all cases included in the study, good control of IOP was achieved in 39/51 (76%) of eyes, and IOP was poor or uncontrolled in 12/51 (24%) of eyes. Twenty out of 41 eyes (49%) maintained fair to excellent vision six months after surgery. Twelve months postoperative observations demonstrated that 12/29 (41%) of the eyes were still visual. CONCLUSIONS: In primary glaucoma, the combined procedure of laser diode cyclophotocoagulation and Ahmed valve implant was associated with return or maintenance of vision in 42/51 eyes (82%) in the immediate short-term of this study, and a long-term IOP control in 39/51 (76%) of the cases, with 12/29 eyes (41%) visual after 12 months.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gutierrez-Quintana, Rodrigo</author><author>Christen, Matthias</author><author>Faller, Kiterie M E</author><author>Guevar, Julien</author><author>Jagannathan, Vidhya</author><author>Leeb, Tosso</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SCN9A variant in a family of mixed breed dogs with congenital insensitivity to  pain.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>230-235</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Pain Insensitivity, Congenital</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36630088</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16610</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) and hereditary sensory and  autonomic neuropathies (HSANs) are a rare group of genetic disorders causing inability to feel pain. Three different associated variants have been identified in dogs: 1 in Border Collies, 1 in mixed breed dogs, and 1 in Spaniels and Pointers. OBJECTIVES: To clinically and genetically characterize CIP in a family of mixed breed dogs. ANIMALS: Two mixed breed dogs from the same litter were independently presented: 1 for evaluation of painless fractures, and the other for chronic thermal skin injuries. METHODS: Physical, neurological, and histopathological evaluations were performed. Whole genome sequencing of 1 affected dog was used to identify homozygous protein-changing variants that were not present in 926 control genomes from diverse dog breeds. RESULTS: Physical and neurological examinations showed the absence of superficial and deep pain perception in the entire body. Histopathological evaluations of the brain, spinal cord and sensory ganglia were normal. Whole genome sequencing identified a homozygous missense variant in SCN9A, XM_038584713.1:c.2761C&gt;T or XP_038440641.1:(p.Arg921Cys). Both affected dogs were homozygous for the mutant allele, which was not detected in 926 dogs of different breeds. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We confirmed the diagnosis of CIP in a family of mixed breed dogs and identified a likely pathogenic variant in the SCN9A gene. The clinical signs observed in these dogs mimic those reported in humans with pathogenic SCN9A variants causing CIP. This report is the first of a spontaneous pathogenic SCN9A variant in domestic animals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Motlová, Lucie</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author><author>Balon, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Are there any differences in the efficacy among second generation antipsychotics  in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders?</title><secondary-title>Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of  Clinical Psychiatrists</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of  Clinical Psychiatrists</full-title></periodical><pages>133-143</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Antipsychotic Agents</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Neuropsychological Tests</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17612853</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10401230701334606</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The goal of this review is to summarize the results of head to head  efficacy studies that compare second generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. METHODS: A literature search through the Medline database and Google was conducted. Articles published up to September 2005 were included. Abstracts from conference papers and posters were not included. RESULTS: Randomized controlled trial data on possible differences in efficacy among atypical antipsychotics are limited. Moreover, the comparison is difficult, as studies differ in outcome measures. The results indicate that first-line second-generation antipsychotics (amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and zotepine) show comparable efficacy. CONCLUSION: Possible new studies should focus on long-term effects, including cost-effectiveness, quality of life, social functioning and service utilization.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manuali, Elisabetta</author><author>Forte, Claudio</author><author>Porcellato, Ilaria</author><author>Brachelente, Chiara</author><author>Sforna, Monica</author><author>Pavone, Silvia</author><author>Ranciati, Saverio</author><author>Morgante, Raffaello</author><author>Crescio, Ines Maria</author><author>Ru, Giuseppe</author><author>Mechelli, Luca</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A five-year cohort study on testicular tumors from a population-based canine  cancer registry in central Italy (Umbria).</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>105201</pages><volume>185</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Italy</keyword><keyword>Leydig Cell Tumor</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Registries</keyword><keyword>Seminoma</keyword><keyword>Sertoli Cell Tumor</keyword><keyword>Testicular Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33229065</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105201</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine testicular tumors account for about 90 % of tumors affecting the male  genitalia. Seminomas (SEM), Sertoli cell tumors (SCT), and interstitial cell tumors (ICT) are the most common histological diagnoses, but their incidence shows high variability among studies. Our aim is to report the results on the analysis of testicular tumors recorded by the population-based Umbria Canine Cancer Registry (CCR) for a 5-year time period and to assess the value of tumor major diameter, measured during trimming, in discriminating neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions. The study was conducted on 388 testicular tumors (on 1969 total male tumors) diagnosed in 355 dogs from 2014 to 2018. The median incidence was 35 cases/100,000 dogs, with a proportion equal to 19,7 % of all tumors. The incidence on neutered male dogs was 352/100,000. Most tumors were ICTs (50 %), with fewer SEMs and SCTs (29 % and 17 %, respectively). Only 3 % of tumors were mixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumors (MGC-SCST). Ten percent of cases had multiple tumors in the same testicle, with SEM-ICT being prevalent (69.2 %). Tumors in cryptorchid testes were 5.9 % of the total, mostly SCT (60.9 %). Mean age at diagnosis was 10.7 ± 2.7, with similar values for different tumor types. Significant incidence ratios (IRR) were found in Golden retriever (IRR 7.18, CI95 % 4.72-10.92) and in English cocker spaniel (IRR 2.30, CI95 % 1.28-4.13) when compared with mixed breed dogs. A value of 0.3 cm (major diameter) of lesions at the moment of trimming was helpful in discriminating a final tumor histological diagnosis from a non-tumor lesion. Since the number of tumors included in this evaluation was limited, further studies to confirm the diagnostic value of this measure are recommended. Our results provided information on the incidence of canine testicular tumors in Umbria region that can be compared with future results and incidence from other geographical areas if provided with reliable data on the total population, can offer solid information on the incidence and proportion of different tumor types in specific territories, contributing also to the supervision of its inhabitants' health. Moreover, pathological data such as the major diameter of tumors can be obtained and contribute to diagnostic routine and standardization.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driessen, Floor</author><author>Cushing, Tim</author><author>Baines, Stephen John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retroperitoneal lymphatic malformation in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>8</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Euthanasia, Animal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</keyword><keyword>Retroperitoneal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Retroperitoneal Space</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32007092</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13028-020-0506-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vascular malformations are rare findings in canine patients  with six reports available in veterinary literature. Retroperitoneal cystic lymphatic malformations have not been described previously in canine patients and neither has the use of immunohistochemistry to determine their origin, i.e. vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria and a painful abdomen. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid filled structure adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a thin walled cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from the retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood vessels were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence 11 months later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort (Norfolk Animal products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation, progression occurred with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and abdominal cavities and the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and positive immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1) confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To our experience, a definitive diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic malformation of lymphatic origin could be done only by combining the clinical presentation, advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1 immunohistochemistry. This is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog where immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic malformation, even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential diagnosis in a patient with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results of this case report can aid in diagnosis of future cases, however, further studies on therapy and management are needed to provide additional information about optimal treatment of these patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mattin, Madeleine J</author><author>Brodbelt, David C</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Boswood, Adrian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors associated with disease progression in dogs with presumed preclinical  degenerative mitral valve disease attending primary care veterinary practices in the United Kingdom.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>445-454</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Diuretics</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Natriuretic Peptide, Brain</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Troponin I</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30565334</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15390</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Factors associated with disease progression in dogs with preclinical  (stage B) degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) have not been evaluated previously in primary care veterinary practice. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether plasma cardiac biomarkers, clinical signs, and physical examination findings are associated with clinical progression (reaching the composite endpoint of initiation of treatment with a potent diuretic or cardiac death) in dogs presumed to have stage B DMVD. ANIMALS: Six-hundred and eighty-four dogs diagnosed with DMVD recruited from 73 primary care practices in the United Kingdom. Dogs were not receiving potent diuretics at recruitment. METHODS: Prospective cohort study design. Primary care veterinarians recorded the presence or absence of clinical signs and physical examination findings. Baseline plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I were measured. Cox regression models measured associations between risk factor variables and clinical progression. Flexible parametric models generated predicted probabilities of reaching the composite endpoint for dogs with different combinations of prognostic risk factor variables. RESULTS: Plasma NT-proBNP, heart rate, heart murmur intensity, presence of a cough, being a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and being prescribed pimobendan were associated with clinical progression to initiation of treatment with a potent diuretic or cardiac-related death. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Dogs with stage B DMVD identified as having a high risk of disease progression might benefit from more frequent monitoring or further diagnostic evaluation. The prognostic factors identified could facilitate risk stratification of dogs presenting with preclinical DMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hammerberg, B</author><author>Bevier, D</author><author>DeBoer, D J</author><author>Olivry, T</author><author>Orton, S M</author><author>Gebhard, D</author><author>Vaden, S L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Auto IgG anti-IgE and IgG x IgE immune complex presence and effects on  ELISA-based quantitation of IgE in canine atopic dermatitis, demodectic acariasis and helminthiasis.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary immunology and immunopathology</full-title></periodical><pages>33-46</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic</keyword><keyword>Antigen-Antibody Complex</keyword><keyword>Ascariasis</keyword><keyword>Autoantibodies</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Atopic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Helminthiasis, Animal</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulin E</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulin G</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9533265</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0165-2427(97)00119-0</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Atopic dermatitis is a common allergic disease manifestation in dogs; however,  there is no correlation between clinical disease and detectable total serum IgE. Auto antibodies of the IgG subclass against IgE may affect the detection of serum IgE by immunoassay and may be important in the regulation of IgE production by B cells. ELISA were developed to detect serum antibodies specific for IgE using a newly available canine monoclonal IgE of known antigen specificity, generated from a canine x murine heterohybridoma. To test for correlation of auto IgG anti-IgE levels with manifestation of atopic dermatitis, the sera from 101 atopic dogs were compared with sera from non-atopic dogs of various breeds, foxhounds manifesting clinical signs of demodectic acariasis and helminth parasitized random bred dogs for quantities of IgG anti-IgE measured in units/ml compared to a high titer standard serum. To test for serum effects on quantitation of IgE, known amounts of canine monoclonal IgE were added to various sera and measured by capture ELISA with detecting monoclonal antibodies specific for heat labile or heat stabile epitopes. Unheated sera from dogs manifesting clinical atopic dermatitis and helminth parasitized dogs had levels of IgG anti-IgE that were significantly lower than various breeds of dogs not manifesting dermatologic lesions and foxhounds manifesting demodectic acariasis. Heating sera at 56 degrees C for 3 h to denature the high affinity binding site on the IgE heavy chain caused a marked increase over non-heated sera in detectable IgG anti-IgE in almost all dogs. This increase was most profound in helminth-infected dogs and foxhounds manifesting demodectic mange with 7 fold increases each, respectively, and in atopic dogs with a 5 fold increase compared to 3 fold increases for clinically-normal springer spaniels and all soft coated wheaten terriers. The terriers demonstrated an association of lower heated serum values of IgG anti-IgE with manifestation of a familial syndrome of protein-losing enteropathy and protein-losing nephropathy. The ability of mouse anti-canine IgE monoclonal antibodies specific for either heat labile or heat stabile epitopes to detect canine monoclonal IgE added to sera in known amounts varied from serum to serum and at different concentrations of the same serum, but did not correlate with IgG anti-IgE values for these sera. The range of absolute levels of serum IgE in dogs showing little or no inhibition of detection of added IgE was &lt; 0.5 ng/micromilligram to 2 micrograms/micromilligram. It was concluded that the increase in detectable IgG anti-IgE after heating sera indicates that IgG x IgE immune complexes are normally present in most dogs; however, the increase over uncomplexed IgG anti-IgE was most pronounced in dogs manifesting atopic dermatitis and demodectic acariasis. A quantitative comparison of IgG anti-IgE or IgG x IgE to total serum IgE was not made because the ability of monoclonal antibodies specific for either heat labile or heat stable epitopes on the IgE heavy chain to detect IgE added to serum, as well as innate serum IgE, was highly variable in different dilutions of serum from individual to individual.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edmunds, Grace L</author><author>Smalley, Matthew J</author><author>Beck, Sam</author><author>Errington, Rachel J</author><author>Gould, Sara</author><author>Winter, Helen</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dog breeds and body conformations with predisposition to osteosarcoma in the UK:  a case-control study.</title><secondary-title>Canine medicine and genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine medicine and genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>2</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33750475</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-021-00100-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is an aggressive and painful bone neoplasm in dogs.  Previous studies have reported epidemiological associations suggesting that large body mass, long bone length and the genetics of certain breeds including the Rottweiler are associated with elevated osteosarcoma risk. However, these studies were often limited by selection bias and confounding factors, and have rarely offered insights into breed-associated protection for osteosarcoma. The current study includes 1756 appendicular and axial osteosarcoma cases presenting to VPG Histology (Bristol, UK) compared against a control population of 905,211 dogs without osteosarcoma from primary care electronic patient records in the VetCompass™ dataset. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis explored associations between demographic risk factors (including breed, chondrodystrophy, age, sex/neuter status, skull-shape, and body mass) and osteosarcoma of all anatomical sites. RESULTS: We identified several breeds with increased and reduced odds of osteosarcoma. At highest risk were the Rottweiler and Great Dane, with &gt; 10 times the odds of osteosarcoma compared with crossbreds, and the Rhodesian Ridgeback, which has not featured in previous lists of at-risk breeds for osteosarcoma, and had an odds ratio of 11.31 (95% confidence interval 7.37-17.35). Breeds at lowest risk of osteosarcoma (protected breeds) included the Bichon Frise, the French Bulldog and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, all with odd ratios of less than 0.30 compared with crossbreds. Body mass was strongly associated with osteosarcoma risk; dogs over 40 kg exhibited osteosarcoma odds of 45.44 (95% confidence interval 33.74-61.20) compared with dogs less than 10 kg. Chondrodystrophic breeds had an osteosarcoma odds ratio of 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.16) compared with non-chondrodystrophic breeds. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of strong breed-associated osteosarcoma risk and protection, suggesting a genetic basis for osteosarcoma pathogenesis. It highlights that breeds selected for long legs/large body mass are generally overrepresented amongst at-risk breeds, whilst those selected for short leg length/small body mass are generally protected. These findings could inform genetic studies to identify osteosarcoma risk alleles in canines and humans; as well as increasing awareness amongst veterinarians and owners, resulting in improved breeding practices and clinical management of osteosarcoma in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Novak, T</author><author>Bankovska Motlova, L</author><author>Capkova, J</author><author>Slovakova, A</author><author>Trancik, P</author><author>Matejka, M</author><author>Höschl, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Psychiatrist's adherence: a new factor in relapse prevention of schizophrenia.

Therefore, improving relapse prevention is a key component of long-term management of schizophrenia. Previous studies using continuous monitoring of an individual's early signs of relapse and adopting preventative pharmacological interventions, when early signs are detected, showed promising clinical results in terms of relapse risk reduction. This 18-month multi-centre parallel randomized controlled, open label, trial with telemedicine relapse prevention programme ITAREPS failed to show superiority of maintenance plus prodrome-based targeted medication strategy over treatment as usual. The study, marked by low investigator's adherence, confirmed that absence of pharmacological intervention at early stage of prodrome, critically influenced the risk of relapse. This and previous randomized controlled trials with telemedicine programme ITAREPS suggested that substantial improvement in relapse prevention in schizophrenia is likely to be unattainable under current clinical settings. Future preventive strategies in schizophrenia would require rapid pharmacological intervention upon occurrence of subclinical prodromal symptoms that are undetectable under conventional outpatient practice. Studies with ITAREPS suggested that integration of telemedicine relapse prevention systems and visiting nurse service might together represent practical solution capable to address those requirements. ABSTRACT: The Information Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) presents a telemedicine solution for weekly monitoring and management of schizophrenia. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in reducing the number of hospitalizations during the 18-month multi-centre parallel randomized controlled, open label, trial. Outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to the active (n = 74) or control group (n = 72). In the active arm, investigators increased the antipsychotic dose upon occurrence of prodrome announced by the system. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no between-group difference in the hospitalization-free survival rate [Kaplan-Meier method; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-2.61, P = 0.6). In a post hoc multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, out of 13 potential predictors, only ITAREPS-related variables (number of alerts without pharmacological intervention/HR = 1.38, P = 0.042/ and patient non-adherence with ITAREPS /HR = 1.08, P = 0.009/) increased the risk of hospitalization. In this trial ITAREPS was not effective. The results in context with previous ITAREPS studies suggest non-adherence of both psychiatrists and patients as the main reasons for the failure of this preventive strategy. Tertiary prevention in schizophrenia have to be regarded a major challenge, warranting the need for implementation of strategies with more active participation of both patient and treating psychiatrist.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodríguez, José</author><author>Santana, Ángelo</author><author>Herráez, Pedro</author><author>Killick, David R</author><author>de Los Monteros, Antonio Espinosa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiology of canine mammary tumours on the Canary Archipelago in Spain.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>268</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Spain</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35821034</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-022-03363-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Mammary gland tumours are the most frequently diagnosed tumours in  the female dogs but just a few studies have analysed their epidemiology. Therefore, we set out to describe the epidemiology of canine mammary cancer in the Canary Archipelago, Spain. We analysed a pathology tumour registry (PTR) and identified 7362 samples obtained from 5240 female dogs resident on the Canary Archipelago during an 18-year period (2003-2020). Using a case-control study design, we compared mammary tumour affected dogs with the Canarian canine population registry in order to elucidate the breed associations for these tumours. RESULTS: The frequency of a diagnosis of mammary tumours relative to all tumour diagnoses in female dogs decreased during the study period from 62.7% to 48.9%. Contemporaneously, the proportion of dogs diagnosed with mammary tumours who were also neutered increased from 13.6% to 26.9%. There was a negative correlation (R = -0.84) between these changes. Additional findings were that: the proportion of female dogs diagnosed with multiple tumours increased by 23.5% and that the proportion of malignant tumours 89.2% diagnosed has remained stable through the period. Benign mammary tumours were diagnosed at younger ages (9.2 years old) than carcinomas (9.7 years old) and sarcomas (10.4 years old). Epithelial mammary tumours were diagnosed at younger ages in entire female dogs. Samoyed, Schnauzer, Poodle, German Pinscher and Cocker Spaniel were the breeds with the highest odds-ratios (OR) in comparison with the reference (crossbreeds) while Miniature Pinscher, American Staffordshire Terrier, English Pointer as well as some local breeds such as the Canary Warren Hound and the Majorero had the lowest ORs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a description of the changing epidemiology of canine mammary cancer in the Canary Archipelago over the last two decades. We found high rates of CMT with a significant predominance of malignant tumours. Exact risk factors are uncertain, but a combination of environmental, regional socioeconomic affecting human and their pets, and animal management factors are likely to play a part. Specifically, neutering was negatively associated with the proportion of epithelial mammary gland tumours and breeds native to the region were at lower risk of mammary tumours. A deeper analysis of all these factors will facilitate a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of mammary gland tumours in both the canine and the human population.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szatmári, Viktor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spontaneous tricuspid valve chordal rupture in a dog with severe, irreversible  pulmonary hypertension caused by Angiostrongylus vasorum infection.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>311</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiostrongylus</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antinematodal Agents</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fenbendazole</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Hypertension, Pulmonary</keyword><keyword>Sildenafil Citrate</keyword><keyword>Strongylida Infections</keyword><keyword>Tricuspid Valve</keyword><keyword>Vasodilator Agents</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32847583</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-020-02531-z</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The adult worms of Angiostrongylus vasorum reside in the pulmonary  artery of dogs and can lead to cardiac, respiratory, and central neurologic signs. Due to luminal obstruction and perivascular inflammation of the pulmonary artery branches, pulmonary hypertension can arise. Pulmonary hypertension, in turn, can lead to severe damage of the right-sided cardiac structures, leading to right ventricular remodeling and tricuspid valve regurgitation. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female English Cocker Spaniel was presented to the author's institution because of abdominal distention and exercise intolerance. Ascites caused by congestive right-sided heart failure was found to be responsible for these problems. The underlying etiology of the right-sided heart failure was a severe pulmonary hypertension caused by Angiostrongylus vasorum infection. Echocardiography revealed, in addition to a severe concentric and eccentric right ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial and pulmonary trunk dilation, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a systolic flail of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve, resulting from ruptured chordae tendineae. As a coincidental finding, a congenital mitral stenosis was found. Oral therapy was initiated with daily administration of fenbendazole for 2 weeks along with daily administration of oral sildenafil until the re-check examination. At the 6-week re-check the dog showed full clinical and partial echocardiographic recovery, and both the blood antigen test for Angiostrongylus vasorum and the fecal Baermann larva isolation test were negative. When the sildenafil therapy was ceased after tapering the daily dosage, the owner reported recurrence of abdominal distension. Re-starting the sildenafil therapy resulted in resolution of this problem. The dog was reported to be clinically healthy with daily sildenafil administration 7 months after the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: The present case report describes a dog where angiostrongylosis led to congestive right-sided heart failure resulting from severe pulmonary hypertension. The secondary right ventricular eccentric hypertrophy together with suspected papillary muscular ischemia were the suspected cause of the ruptured major tricuspid chordae tendineae, which led to a severe tricuspid valve regurgitation. Despite eradication of the worms, the severe pulmonary hypertension persisted. Treatment with daily oral sildenafil, a pulmonary arterial vasodilator, was enough to keep the dog free of clinically apparent ascites.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, Collette</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Catchpole, Brian</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Leptospirosis vaccination in dogs attending UK primary care practices: vaccine  uptake and factors associated with administration.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>285</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Leptospirosis</keyword><keyword>Mammals</keyword><keyword>Primary Health Care</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Vaccination</keyword><keyword>Vaccines</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35864518</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-022-03382-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is found globally and  affects most mammalian species. Vaccination of dogs against leptospirosis is an important approach to preventing clinical disease, or reducing disease severity, as well as reducing transmission of the infection to humans. Although it is generally considered to be a 'core' vaccine, there is limited information on the level of leptospirosis vaccine usage and factors associated with its usage in dogs in the UK. The study aimed to report the uptake of leptospirosis vaccination and factors associated with its usage in a cohort of dogs under primary veterinary care during a 12-month period. RESULTS: From a population of 905,543 dogs, 49% (95%CI 48.9-49.1%) had at least one leptospirosis vaccine administered during the 12 months of study. Adult dogs had reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine when compared to dogs &lt; 1 year old, with dogs &gt; 8 years old having a greater than ten-fold reduction in odds (OR = 0.08, 95%CI 0.07-0.09). Odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine was increased in insured dogs when compared to uninsured dogs (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.17-1.28). Neutered dogs had reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine (OR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.83-0.91). Breed associations with receiving a leptospirosis vaccine varied. Several breeds were associated with increased odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine when compared to crossbreed dogs, including Border Terriers (OR = 1.49, 95%CI 1.42-1.57), Golden Retrievers (OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.24-1.37), Cocker Spaniels (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.31) and West Highland White Terriers (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.22-1.31). French Bulldogs (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.62-0.67), Staffordshire Bull Terriers (OR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.78-0.82) and Pugs (OR = 0.91, 95%CI =0.88-0.95) had significantly reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccination during the study. CONCLUSION: This work identified that almost half of the UK primary care attending population received a leptospirosis vaccine during the year. Several demographic variables were associated with leptospirosis vaccine administration, with age being particularly important. Both the proportion of uptake and factors associated with leptospirosis vaccine usage can be used as a benchmark for comparisons in the future. Additionally, an understanding of which populations have reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine can potentially be used for initiatives to encourage owner vaccination uptake in these groups.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prejzek, Ondřej</author><author>Spaniel, Miroslav</author><author>Mareš, Tomáš</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microstructural residual stress in particle-filled dental composite.</title><secondary-title>Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>124-129</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Composite Resins</keyword><keyword>Dental Stress Analysis</keyword><keyword>Finite Element Analysis</keyword><keyword>Hydrostatic Pressure</keyword><keyword>Models, Theoretical</keyword><keyword>Stress, Mechanical</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>23531199</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10255842.2013.781158</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The main goal of this study is to develop a micromechanical model of a  particle-filled dental composite focused on the residual stress (RS) field developed during the curing process in its microstructure. A finite element model of a representative volume element of filler and resin was developed, and volumetric shrinkage was simulated during the curing process. Four material models (von Mises plasticity model, Drucker-Prager plasticity model, von Mises plasticity model with stress relaxation and Drucker-Prager plasticity with stress relaxation) of the polymer resin were built to assess the influence of the material model on the resulting internal stress. The relationship between the curing process and the magnitude of the stress components will be described, and an analysis of the post-curing state of the material in particular microstructure locations will be conducted in this study. Obtained RS is comparable to the stresses developed in the material under the external load. The substantial dependence on the choice of material model for resin is to be observed, and the suitability of particular models is discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kesner, Ladislav</author><author>Fajnerová, Iveta</author><author>Adámek, Petr</author><author>Buchtík, Martin</author><author>Grygarová, Dominika</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author><author>Kozelka, Pavel</author><author>Nekovářová, Tereza</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Tintěra, Jaroslav</author><author>Alexová, Aneta</author><author>Greguš, David</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fusiform Activity Distinguishes Between Subjects With Low and High Xenophobic  Attitudes Toward Refugees.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>98</pages><volume>14</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33061893</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fnbeh.2020.00098</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study analyzes how people's attitudes to the European refugee crisis (ERC)  correspond to selected psychological state and trait measures and impact the neural processing of media images of refugees. From a large pool of respondents, who filled in an online xenophobia questionnaire, we selected two groups (total N = 38) with the same socio-demographic background, but with opposite attitudes toward refugees. We found that a negative attitude toward refugees (high xenophobia - HX) was associated with a significantly higher conscientiousness score and with a higher trait aggression and hostility, but there was no group effect connected with empathy, fear, and anxiety measures. At the neural level we found that brain activity during the presentation of ERC stimuli is affected by xenophobic attitudes-with more xenophobic subjects exhibiting a higher BOLD response in the left fusiform gyrus. However, while the fMRI results demonstrate increased attention and vigilance toward ERC-related stimuli in the HX group, they do not show differentiated patterns of brain activity associated with perception of dehumanized outgroup.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dees, D Dustin</author><author>Fritz, Kevin J</author><author>Maclaren, Nicole E</author><author>Esson, Douglas W</author><author>Sheehan Gaerig, Annora M</author><author>Atkins, Rosalie M</author><author>Knollinger, Amy M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficacy of prophylactic antiglaucoma and anti-inflammatory medications in canine  primary angle-closure glaucoma: a multicenter retrospective study (2004-2012).</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>195-200</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Administration, Topical</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Inflammatory Agents</keyword><keyword>Antihypertensive Agents</keyword><keyword>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Angle-Closure</keyword><keyword>Intraocular Pressure</keyword><keyword>Latanoprost</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prostaglandins F, Synthetic</keyword><keyword>Quaternary Ammonium Compounds</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sulfonamides</keyword><keyword>Thiophenes</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>23826812</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12069</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term efficacy of antiglaucoma medications with or  without combined topical anti-inflammatory treatment in preventing increased intraocular pressure and clinical signs of glaucoma in eyes considered at risk of the development of the disease. METHODS: Retrospective analysis identified 88 canine patients presenting with unilateral acute congestive primary angle-closure glaucoma (IOP &gt; 25 mm Hg) and gonioscopic findings of pectinate ligament dysplasia and/or narrow or closed iridocorneal angle in the contralateral nonglaucomatous eye. Patients with histopathologic confirmation of pectinate ligament dysplasia or angle closure in the initial glaucomatous eye receiving prophylactic medical therapy in the contralateral eye were included. Time to medical failure for each antiglaucoma medication and efficacy of the combination therapy were evaluated. RESULTS: The most commonly affected pure-breds were the American Cocker Spaniel (20.4%) and Basset Hound (11.36%). The patients receiving demecarium bromide 0.125% had the longest estimated median time to medical failure at 330.0 days, followed by latanoprost 0.005%, dorzolamide hydrochloride 2.0%, and demecarium bromide 0.25% at 284.0 days, 272.5 days, and 143.0 days, respectively. The estimated median time to medical failure for patients receiving topical antiglaucoma and anti-inflammatory medication was 324.0 days versus 195.0 days in patients receiving antiglaucoma medication alone. Survival analysis showed no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: None of the four antiglaucoma medications evaluated statistically delayed medical failure when compared to each other. Although significance was not achieved, our data suggest that adjunctive use of topical anti-inflammatory medications may be beneficial in these cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Galizzi, Alberto</author><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Stranieri, Angelica</author><author>Zanaboni, Anna Maria</author><author>Malchiodi, Dario</author><author>Borromeo, Vitaliano</author><author>Brambilla, Paola Giuseppina</author><author>Locatelli, Chiara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors affecting the urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio in healthy dogs and  dogs with naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>15</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aldosterone</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Furosemide</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Renin-Angiotensin System</keyword><keyword>Spironolactone</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33413406</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-020-02716-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation in  course of heart diseases contributes to cardiac remodeling and heart failure. Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is characterized by different stages of severity and trend of RAAS activity during the course of the disease is still uncertain. The urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) has been proven to reflect RAAS activation in dogs and might be a useful marker in monitoring therapy and disease progression, but data about this parameter need to be expanded. The objective of this study was to evaluate the UAldo:C in healthy dogs and dogs with naturally occurring MMVD, and to investigate the relationships between this parameter and clinical, echocardiographic and laboratory variables. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 149 dogs: 49 healthy and 100 MMVD dogs (45 stage B1, 13 stage B2 and 42 stage C). Urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio was not significantly different among healthy and MMVD dogs of any stages. Breed, sex and age showed a significant impact on UAldo:C. In particular, Chihuahua and Cavalier King Charles spaniel showed significantly higher UAldo:C than other breeds, as well as intact females than other genders. In stage C dogs, UAldo:C appeared to be increased by spironolactone and was positively associated with furosemide dose (P = 0.024). Aldosterone breakthrough (ABT) appeared to occur in 36% (8/22) of stage C dogs not receiving spironolactone. A significant positive association between UAldo:C and left atrium-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Individual factors such as breed, sex and age appeared to influence UAldo:C, and therapy seemed to add further variability. In the light of these results, comparing the UAldo:C of a single patient with a population-based reference value might lead to wrong interpretations and an individual monitoring should be considered. The prevalence of ABT in the present study (36%) was in line with those previously reported. However, due to the high individual variability of UAldo:C found in the study, even this result should be re-evaluated in the setting of an individual longitudinal approach. The positive association between UAldo:C and LA/Ao supports the mutual relationship between RAAS and cardiac remodeling.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author><author>Hodge, Rebecca</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Meeson, Richard L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiology and clinical management of elbow joint disease in dogs under primary  veterinary care in the UK.</title><secondary-title>Canine medicine and genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine medicine and genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32835227</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-020-0080-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Conditions affecting the elbow joint are a common cause of lameness  in dogs. Primary-care veterinary clinical data are now recognised as a valuable research resource. Using data from the VetCompass Programme, this study aimed to report the frequency and risk factors for elbow joint disease in dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK and describe clinical management. RESULTS: From 455,069 dogs under veterinary care, the one-year period prevalence for elbow joint disease diagnosis was 0.56% (95% CI: 0.53-0.60). Of 616 incident cases, the most common specific variants of elbow joint disease were osteoarthritis (n = 468, 75.97%), elbow dysplasia (190, 30.84%) and traumatic (41, 6.66%). The most common signs described by the owners were lameness (n = 466, 75.65%), difficulty exercising (123, 19.97%) and pain (86, 13.96%). The most common findings recorded on veterinary examination were pain (n = 283, 45.94%), lameness (278, 45.13%) and reduced range of movement (243, 39.45%). Common medications used included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 544, 88.31%), tramadol (121, 19.64%) and disease modifying agents (118, 19.16%). Of 109 deaths involving euthanasia with information available from the 616 incident cases, elbow joint disease contributed to the decision to euthanase in 45 (41.28%) dogs.Five breeds showed increased odds of elbow joint disease compared with crossbred dogs: Rottweiler (OR: 6.16, 95% CI 3.89-9.75), Labrador Retriever (OR: 5.94, 95% CI 4.65-7.60), German Shepherd Dog (OR: 4.13, 95% CI 2.88-5.93), Golden Retriever (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.93-5.00) and English Springer Spaniel (OR: 2.00, 95% CI 1.26-3.18). Additional risk factors included having an adult bodyweight that was equal or higher than their breed/sex mean, advancing age, being male, being neutered, being insured and larger bodyweight. CONCLUSIONS: Elbow joint disease is a relatively common diagnosis in dogs and has a high welfare impact as evidenced by the high proportion of cases recorded with pain, lameness and analgesic therapy. There are strong breed predispositions, in particular for large breed dogs. These findings present a clear case for improved breeding programmes to reduce the burden of elbow joint disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Corah, Caroline H</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author><author>Rutherford, Lynda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lipoma in dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK: prevalence and breed  associations.</title><secondary-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>9</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30279993</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-018-0065-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Lipomas are masses of mesenchymal origin, comprising of adipocytes,  and are often clinically unremarkable but can be alarming to owners. Although lipomas are reportedly common in dogs, no studies have specifically investigated risk factors associated with their occurrence. This study was a large-scale retrospective analysis of electronic patient records of dogs attending practices participating in VetCompass™. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to evaluate associations between risk factors and primary-care veterinary diagnosis of lipoma. RESULTS: From 384,284 dogs under veterinary care during 2013 at 215 primary practice clinics in the UK, there were 2765 lipoma cases identified giving a one-year prevalence of 1.94% (95% CI: 1.87-2.01). Breeds with the highest lipoma prevalence included Weimaraner (7.84%, 95% CI 6.46-9.40), Dobermann Pinscher (6.96%, 95% CI 5.67-8.44), German Pointer (5.23%, 95% CI 3.93-6.80), Springer Spaniel (5.19%, 95% CI 4.76-5.66), and Labrador Retriever (5.15%, 95% CI 4.90-5.41). Dogs with an adult bodyweight equal or higher than their breed/sex mean had 1.96 (95% CI 1.81-2.14, P &lt;  0.001) times the odds of lipoma compared with dogs that weighed below their breed/sex mean. The odds of lipoma increased as adult bodyweight increased. Increased age was strongly associated with increasing odds of lipoma. Compared with dogs aged 3.0 to &lt; 6.0 years, dogs aged 9.0 - &lt; 12.0 years had 17.52 times the odds (95% CI 14.71-20.85, P &lt;  0.001) of lipoma. Neutered males (OR: 1.99, 95% CI 1.69-2.36, P &lt;  0.001) and neutered females (OR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.37-1.91, P &lt;  0.001) had higher odds than entire females. Insured dogs had 1.78 (95% CI 1.53-2.07, P &lt;  0.001) times the odds of lipoma compared with uninsured dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Lipomas appear to be a relatively common diagnosis in primary-care practice. Certain breeds were identified with remarkably high lipoma prevalence, highlighting the risk that owners should be prepared for. Lipoma predisposition of larger bodyweight individuals within breed/sex suggests that being overweight or obese may be a predisposing factor but would need further work to confirm.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bankovská Motlová, Lucie</author><author>Dragomirecká, Eva</author><author>Blabolová, Anna</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Slováková, Andrea</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Psychoeducation for schizophrenia in the Czech Republic: curriculum modification  based on opinions of service users and providers.</title><secondary-title>Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of  Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of  Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>186-190</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Attitude of Health Personnel</keyword><keyword>Caregivers</keyword><keyword>Clinical Competence</keyword><keyword>Czech Republic</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Emotional Intelligence</keyword><keyword>Focus Groups</keyword><keyword>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mental Health Services</keyword><keyword>Needs Assessment</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Psychiatry</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Social Work, Psychiatric</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>education</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25416609</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40596-014-0234-4</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The authors examined current knowledge about psychoeducation for  schizophrenia in Czech Republic. METHODS: The authors sent a screening survey to 550 mental health-care facilities and administered a detailed questionnaire to 113 providers of mental health and social services and to 200 service users. The authors also carried out 14 focus groups and 16 individual interviews. RESULTS: Forty-six departments provided some type of psychoeducation for schizophrenia; of these, 16 provided family psychoeducation for patients and relatives and 1 provided psychoeducation only for relatives. Service users who received psychoeducation performed significantly better in the test of knowledge than did service users who did not receive psychoeducation. CONCLUSION: The authors propose a service user-driven curriculum based on information delivery followed by skills training. Psychiatrists should learn to explain schizophrenia relapse neurobiology to laypeople and to address relatives' frustrations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, Fraje</author><author>Coppi, A Augusto</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author><author>Packer, Rowena M A</author><author>Tauro, Anna</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of volume of the forebrain, subarachnoid space and lateral ventricles  between dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and controls using a stereological approach: Cavalieri's principle.</title><secondary-title>Canine medicine and genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine medicine and genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>3</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33691781</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-021-00101-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Canine idiopathic epilepsy (IE) is the most common chronic  neurological brain disease in dogs, yet it can only be diagnosed by exclusion of all other potential causes. In people, epilepsy has been associated with a reduction in brain volume. The objective was to estimate the volume of the forebrain (FB), subarachnoid space (SAS) and lateral ventricles (LV) in dogs with IE compared to controls using Cavalieri's principle. MRI scans of case and control dogs were identified from two neurology referral hospital databases. Eight breeds with increased odds of having IE were included: Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Cocker Spaniel, Border terrier, German Shepherd dog, Parson Jack Russell terrier, Boxer, and Border Collie. Five dogs of each breed with IE and up to five controls were systematically and uniformly randomly sampled (SURS). The volume of the FB, SAS and LV were estimated from MRI scans by one blinded observer using Cavalieri's principle. RESULTS: One hundred-two dogs were identified; 56 were diagnosed with IE and 46 were controls. There was no statistically significant difference in FB, SAS and LV volume between dogs with IE and controls. Dogs with a history of status epilepticus had significantly larger FB than those without (p = 0.05). There was a border-line trend for LV volume to increase with increasing length of seizure history in the IE group (p = 0.055). CONCLUSION: The volumes of the FB, SAS and LV are not different between dogs with IE and controls, so IE remains a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific neuroanatomical biomarkers identified. This is the first time FB and SAS volume has been compared in dogs with IE. Unfortunately, we have shown that the results reporting significantly larger FBs in dogs with status epilepticus and LV volume increase with length of seizure history were likely confounded by breed and should be interpreted cautiously. Whilst these associations are interesting and clinically relevant, further investigation with breed-specific or larger, breed-diverse populations are required to permit strong conclusions. The Cavalieri principle provided an effective estimation of FB, SAS and LV volumes on MRI, but may be too time-intensive for use in clinical practice.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, Carolyn</author><author>Honda, Masao</author><author>Selitsky, Sara R</author><author>Yamane, Daisuke</author><author>Shimakami, Tetsuro</author><author>Kaneko, Shuichi</author><author>Lanford, Robert E</author><author>Lemon, Stanley M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>microRNA-122 abundance in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-tumor liver tissue  from Japanese patients with persistent HCV versus HBV infection.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e76867</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Asian People</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Hepatocellular</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis B</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis C</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interferons</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Pan troglodytes</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>virology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24130799</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0076867</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Mechanisms of hepatic carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are  incompletely defined but often assumed to be similar and related to immune-mediated inflammation. Despite this, several studies hint at differences in expression of miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA with tumor suppressor properties, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) versus hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Differences in the expression of miR-122 in these cancers would be of interest, as miR-122 is an essential host factor for HCV but not HBV replication. To determine whether the abundance of miR-122 in cancer tissue is influenced by the nature of the underlying virus infection, we measured miR-122 by qRT-PCR in paired tumor and non-tumor tissues from cohorts of HBV- and HCV-infected Japanese patients. miR-122 abundance was significantly reduced from normal in HBV-associated HCC, but not in liver cancer associated with HCV infection. This difference was independent of the degree of differentiation of the liver cancer. Surprisingly, we also found significant differences in miR-122 expression in non-tumor tissue, with miR-122 abundance reduced from normal in HCV- but not HBV-infected liver. Similar differences were observed in HCV- vs. HBV-infected chimpanzees. Among HCV-infected Japanese subjects, reductions in miR-122 abundance in non-tumor tissue were associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism near the IL28B gene that predicts poor response to interferon-based therapy (TG vs. TT genotype at rs8099917), and correlated negatively with the abundance of multiple interferon-stimulated gene transcripts. Reduced levels of miR-122 in chronic hepatitis C thus appear to be associated with endogenous interferon responses to the virus, while differences in miR-122 expression in HCV- versus HBV-associated HCC likely reflect virus-specific mechanisms contributing to carcinogenesis. The continued expression of miR-122 in HCV-associated HCC may signify an important role for HCV replication late in the progression to malignancy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cuesta-Frau, David</author><author>Schneider, Jakub</author><author>Bakštein, Eduard</author><author>Vostatek, Pavel</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Novák, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classification of Actigraphy Records from Bipolar Disorder Patients Using Slope  Entropy: A Feasibility Study.</title><secondary-title>Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>22</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33287011</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/e22111243</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Bipolar Disorder (BD) is an illness with high prevalence and a huge social and  economic impact. It is recurrent, with a long-term evolution in most cases. Early treatment and continuous monitoring have proven to be very effective in mitigating the causes and consequences of BD. However, no tools are currently available for a massive and semi-automatic BD patient monitoring and control. Taking advantage of recent technological developments in the field of wearables, this paper studies the feasibility of a BD episodes classification analysis while using entropy measures, an approach successfully applied in a myriad of other physiological frameworks. This is a very difficult task, since actigraphy records are highly non-stationary and corrupted with artifacts (no activity). The method devised uses a preprocessing stage to extract epochs of activity, and then applies a quantification measure, Slope Entropy, recently proposed, which outperforms the most common entropy measures used in biomedical time series. The results confirm the feasibility of the approach proposed, since the three states that are involved in BD, depression, mania, and remission, can be significantly distinguished.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kopecek, Miloslav</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Novák, Tomás</author><author>Tislerová, Barbora</author><author>Belohlávek, Otakar</author><author>Horácek, Jirí</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>18FDG PET in hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients.</title><secondary-title>Neuro endocrinology letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuro endocrinology letters</full-title></periodical><pages>53-59</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain Mapping</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Cognition</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorodeoxyglucose F18</keyword><keyword>Hallucinations</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Positron-Emission Tomography</keyword><keyword>Prefrontal Cortex</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Radiopharmaceuticals</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17277726</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to detect whether the abnormal regional brain  activity correlates with auditory verbal hallucination-proneness (AVH) in a group of patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses. METHODS: 15 patients with prominent AVH (score for hallucination intensity--item 3 in the PANSS &gt; or =4) and 15 control patients without AVH (item 3 PANSS score &lt; or =2) underwent 18FDG positron emission tomography at rest. RESULTS: SPM group analysis revealed an increased uptake of 18FDG in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA46) in subjects with high verbal hallucination score compared to non-hallucinating patients (p&lt;0.001, uncorrected). Activation in BA46 positively correlated with the intensity of hallucinations (Spearman r=0.57; p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The observed functional recruitment of the right prefrontal cortex in subjects with high hallucination score may reflect impairment in the integration of intended actions and sensory feedback resulting in misattribution of internal events to an external source.

Using double-blind sham-controlled parallel design, we evaluated the effect of HF-rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Sixteen schizophrenia patients with predominantly negative symptoms on stable antipsychotic medication were treated with 20 Hz rTMS (90% of motor threshold, 2000 stimuli per session) over ten days within 2 weeks with six weeks follow-up. The effect was assessed using PANSS, CGI, MADRS and neuropsychological tests. We failed to find any significant effect of active rTMS. Sham rTMS showed a trend for improvement over time on positive and negative subscales of PANSS and MADRS. Between-group comparisons failed to reveal any significant differences on any rating scales except a positive subscale of PANSS after 8 weeks. Results from our study did not confirm that HF-rTMS over the left DLPCF affects the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and alternative rTMS approaches are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Motlova, Lucie</author><author>Dragomirecka, Eva</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Goppoldova, Eva</author><author>Zalesky, Richard</author><author>Selepova, Pavla</author><author>Figlova, Zuzana</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relapse prevention in schizophrenia: does group family psychoeducation matter?

Relapse prevention is one of the most important goals of long-term  schizophrenia management, as relapse is both distressing and costly. Family intervention supplementation to standard treatment could reduce the relapse rate. This study assessed the influence of a short-term, clinically based, and profesionally led family psychoeducation programme on a 1-year relapse rate. Methods. A total of 120 patients were recruited upon discharge from two psychiatric hospitals in Prague: (1) Site A (N=86), where family psychoeducation is offered to all patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and acute psychotic episode with schizophrenic symptoms; and (2) Site B (N=34), where no such programme was offered. Results. Compared to nonparticipants, psychoeducation participants had a shorter average length of rehospitalization stay (5.89 vs. 17.78 days, P=0.045) in a 1-year follow-up after discharge. The probability of rehospitalization during a 1-year follow-up was higher for patients from the site that did not provide psychoeducation. Conclusions. A shorter average length of rehospitalization of psychoeducation participants, a high turnout of first-episode patients, and positive responses of psychoeducation participants suggest that family psychoeducation should be supplemented early in the course of the illness to achieve favourable treatment outcomes and minimize adverse health and the social consequences of schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wos, Guillaume</author><author>Mořkovská, Jana</author><author>Bohutínská, Magdalena</author><author>Šrámková, Gabriela</author><author>Knotek, Adam</author><author>Lučanová, Magdalena</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Marhold, Karol</author><author>Kolář, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of ploidy in colonization of alpine habitats in natural populations of  Arabidopsis arenosa.</title><secondary-title>Annals of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>255-268</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Arabidopsis</keyword><keyword>Ecosystem</keyword><keyword>Europe</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ploidies</keyword><keyword>Polyploidy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31185073</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/aob/mcz070</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Polyploidy is an important driver of plant diversification  and adaptation to novel environments. As a consequence of genome doubling, polyploids often exhibit greater colonizing ability or occupy a wider ecological niche than diploids. Although elevation has been traditionally considered as a key driver structuring ploidy variation, we do not know if environmental and phenotypic differentiation among ploidy cytotypes varies along an elevational gradient. Here, we tested for the consequences of genome duplication on genetic diversity, phenotypic variation and habitat preferences on closely related diploid and tetraploid populations that coexist along approx. 2300 m of varying elevation. METHODS: We sampled and phenotyped 45 natural diploid and tetraploid populations of Arabidopsis arenosa in one mountain range in Central Europe (Western Carpathians) and recorded abiotic and biotic variables at each collection site. We inferred genetic variation, population structure and demographic history in a sub-set of 29 populations genotyped for approx. 36 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. KEY RESULTS: We found minor effects of polyploidy on colonization of alpine stands and low genetic differentiation between the two cytotypes, mirroring recent divergence of the polyploids from the local diploid lineage and repeated reticulation events among the cytotypes. This pattern was corroborated by the absence of ecological niche differentiation between the two cytotypes and overall phenotypic similarity at a given elevation. CONCLUSIONS: The case of A. arenosa contrasts with previous studies that frequently showed clear niche differentiation between cytotypes. Our work stresses the importance of considering genetic structure and past demographic processes when interpreting the patterns of ploidy distributions, especially in species that underwent recent polyploidization events.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Motlová, Lucie Bankovská</author><author>Dragomirecká, Eva</author><author>Matelová, Sárka</author><author>Otevrelová, Renata</author><author>Cermáková, Radka</author><author>Cermák, Jan</author><author>Lednická, Eva</author><author>Hegedüsová, Renata</author><author>Hübsch, Tomás</author><author>Rothanzlová, Sona</author><author>Tomesová, Martina</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Kitzlerová, Eva</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Education in schizophrenia: how patients and their relatives assess the relapse  prevention programme PREDUKA].</title><secondary-title>Casopis lekaru ceskych</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Casopis lekaru ceskych</full-title></periodical><pages>21-25</pages><volume>149</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptation, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Educational Measurement</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Medication Adherence</keyword><keyword>Parents</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>education</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20662456</accession-num><language>cze</language><urls/><abstract>Antipsychotic medication and early relapse warning signs detection are the  cornerstone of relapse prevention in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Many patients do not use antipsychotic medication because of lack of information about its preventive effects and the risk of relapse. We introduce PREDUKA--PREventive EDUcational programme for relapse prevention. The goal of the programme is to deliver the information about schizophrenia to patients and their relatives. 178 patients and 252 relatives (118 mothers and 51 fathers) took part in 25 one-day psychoeducational programmes in 6 centres in the Czech Republic between January 2008 and June 2009 and anonymously fulfilled a short questionnaire. Patients and relatives assessed the programme with an average mark 1.4 (1 best, 5 worst). 49.4% patients and 49.0% relatives had received enough information about psychotic disorders during their hospitalization. Moreover 94.1% patients and 95.7% relatives confirmed acquiring new information on how to live with psychosis as a result of PREDUKA programme. 59.6% patients and 73.8% relatives were interested in ITAREPS - Information Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme. Mothers were significantly more interested (82.2%) than fathers (62.2%) (p = 0.031). Expressed high interest of patients and their relatives in both programmes indicates their readiness to become active and competent partners in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horácek, J</author><author>Závesická, L</author><author>Tintera, J</author><author>Dockery, C</author><author>Platilová, V</author><author>Kopecek, M</author><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Bubeníková, V</author><author>Höschl, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of tryptophan depletion on brain activation measured by functional  magnetic resonance imaging during the Stroop test in healthy subjects.</title><secondary-title>Physiological research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physiological research</full-title></periodical><pages>235-244</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Cross-Over Studies</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Psychomotor Performance</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Tryptophan</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15544421</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We investigated the role of serotonin in cognitive activation of the frontal  cortex. The serotonergic system was affected by the administration of an amino acids mixture without tryptophan (tryptophan depletion). In a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study with 20 healthy volunteers, we tested the hypothesis that a tryptophan (serotonin) decrease affects the activation of prefrontal cortex by the Stroop test. Cognitive brain activation was evaluated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Tryptophan depletion decreased the plasma tryptophan level up to 90 % for five hours after the tryptophan-free drink had been consumed when compared with the same mixture with tryptophan (p?0.0001). Tryptophan depletion did not affect the Stroop test performance. We compared fMRI activation in both conditions (tryptophan depletion and placebo) with plasma tryptophan levels as the covariates. The tryptophan depletion increased the activation (fMRI signal) in the bilateral mediofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The present findings allow the postulate that serotonergic medial forebrain and cingulum bundle pathways play a role in the activity of cortical structures involved in Stroop test processing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lahutsina, Anastasiya</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Mrzilkova, Jana</author><author>Morozova, Alexandra</author><author>Brabec, Marek</author><author>Musil, Vladimir</author><author>Zach, Petr</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphology of Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Its Relation to Schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36614833</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jcm12010033</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cortical folding of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), particularly the  cingulate (CS) and the paracingulate (PCS) sulci, represents a neurodevelopmental marker. Deviations in in utero development in schizophrenia can be traced using CS and PCS morphometry. In the present study, we measured the length of CS, PCS, and their segments on T1 MRI scans in 93 patients with first- episode schizophrenia and 42 healthy controls. Besides the length, the frequency and the left-right asymmetry of CS/PCS were compared in patients and controls. Distribution of the CS and PCS morphotypes in patients was different from controls. Parcellated sulcal pattern CS3a in the left hemisphere was longer in patients (53.8 ± 25.7 mm vs. 32.7 ± 19.4 mm in controls, p &lt; 0.05), while in CS3c it was reversed—longer in controls (52.5 ± 22.5 mm as opposed to 36.2 ± 12.9 mm, n.s. in patients). Non parcellated PCS in the right hemisphere were longer in patients compared to controls (19.4 ± 10.2 mm vs. 12.1 ± 12.4 mm, p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, concurrent presence of PCS1 and CS1 in the left hemisphere and to some extent in the right hemisphere may be suggestive of a higher probability of schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mráz, Patrik</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Keller, Andreas</author><author>Bowmann, Gillianne</author><author>Farkas, Alexandre</author><author>Šingliarová, Barbora</author><author>Rohr, Rudolf P</author><author>Broennimann, Olivier</author><author>Müller-Schärer, Heinz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anthropogenic disturbance as a driver of microspatial and microhabitat  segregation of cytotypes of Centaurea stoebe and cytotype interactions in secondary contact zones.</title><secondary-title>Annals of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>615-627</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Austria</keyword><keyword>Biological Evolution</keyword><keyword>Centaurea</keyword><keyword>Diploidy</keyword><keyword>Ecosystem</keyword><keyword>Gene Flow</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Hybridization, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Phylogeography</keyword><keyword>Population Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Slovakia</keyword><keyword>Tetraploidy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22730023</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/aob/mcs120</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In a mixed-ploidy population, strong frequency-dependent  mating will lead to the elimination of the less common cytotype, unless prezygotic barriers enhance assortative mating. However, such barriers favouring cytotype coexistence have only rarely been explored. Here, an assessment is made of the mechanisms involved in formation of mixed-ploidy populations and coexistence of diploid plants and their closely related allotetraploid derivates from the Centaurea stoebe complex (Asteraceae). METHODS: An investigation was made of microspatial and microhabitat distribution, life-history and fitness traits, flowering phenology, genetic relatedness of cytotypes and intercytotype gene flow (cpDNA and microsatellites) in six mixed-ploidy populations in Central Europe. KEY RESULTS: Diploids and tetraploids were genetically differentiated, thus corroborating the secondary origin of contact zones. The cytotypes were spatially segregated at all sites studied, with tetraploids colonizing preferentially drier and open microhabitats created by human-induced disturbances. Conversely, they were rare in more natural microsites and microsites with denser vegetation despite their superior persistence ability (polycarpic life cycle). The seed set of tetraploid plants was strongly influenced by their frequency in mixed-ploidy populations. Triploid hybrids originated from bidirectional hybridizations were extremely rare and almost completely sterile, indicating a strong postzygotic barrier between cytotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that tetraploids are later immigrants into already established diploid populations and that anthropogenic activities creating open niches favouring propagule introductions were the major factor shaping the non-random distribution and habitat segregation of cytotypes at fine spatial scale. Establishment and spread of tetraploids was further facilitated by their superior persistence through the perennial life cycle. The results highlight the importance of non-adaptive spatio-temporal processes in explaining microhabitat and microspatial segregation of cytotypes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marhold, Karol</author><author>Kudoh, Hiroshi</author><author>Pak, Jae-Hong</author><author>Watanabe, Kuniaki</author><author>Spaniel, Stanislav</author><author>Lihová, Judita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytotype diversity and genome size variation in eastern Asian polyploid Cardamine  (Brassicaceae) species.</title><secondary-title>Annals of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>249-264</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cardamine</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Plant</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>Genome, Plant</keyword><keyword>Japan</keyword><keyword>Korea</keyword><keyword>Polyploidy</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20007978</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/aob/mcp282</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intraspecific ploidy-level variation is an important aspect  of a species' genetic make-up, which may lend insight into its evolutionary history and future potential. The present study explores this phenomenon in a group of eastern Asian Cardamine species. METHODS: Plant material was sampled from 59 localities in Japan and Korea, which were used in karyological (chromosome counting) and flow cytometric analyses. The absolute nuclear DNA content (in pg) was measured using propidium iodide and the relative nuclear DNA content (in arbitrary units) was measured using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorochrome. KEY RESULTS: Substantial cytotype diversity was found, with strikingly different distribution patterns between the species. Two cytotypes were found in C. torrentis sensu lato (4x and 8x, in C. valida and C. torrentis sensu stricto, respectively), which displays a north-south geographical pattern in Japan. Hypotheses regarding their origin and colonization history in the Japanese archipelago are discussed. In Korean C. amaraeiformis, only tetraploids were found, and these populations may in fact belong to C. valida. C. yezoensis was found to harbour as many as six cytotypes in Japan, ranging from hexa- to dodecaploids. Ploidy levels do not show any obvious geographical pattern; populations with mixed ploidy levels, containing two to four cytotypes, are frequently observed throughout the range. C. schinziana, an endemic of Hokkaido, has hexa- and octoploid populations. Previous chromosome records are also revised, showing that they are largely based on misidentified material or misinterpreted names. CONCLUSIONS: Sampling of multiple populations and utilization of the efficient flow cytometric approach allowed the detection of large-scale variation in ploidy levels and genome size variation attributable to aneuploidy. These data will be essential in further phylogenetic and evolutionary studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horacek, J</author><author>Brunovsky, M</author><author>Novak, T</author><author>Tislerova, B</author><author>Palenicek, T</author><author>Bubenikova-Valesova, V</author><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Koprivova, J</author><author>Mohr, P</author><author>Balikova, M</author><author>Hoschl, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subanesthetic dose of ketamine decreases prefrontal theta cordance in healthy  volunteers: implications for antidepressant effect.</title><secondary-title>Psychological medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychological medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1443-1451</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Affect</keyword><keyword>Anesthetics, Dissociative</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Cross-Over Studies</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Electroencephalography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ketamine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Prefrontal Cortex</keyword><keyword>Theta Rhythm</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19995475</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0033291709991619</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Theta cordance is a novel quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG)  measure that correlates with cerebral perfusion. A series of clinical studies has demonstrated that the prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and that this effect precedes clinical improvement. Ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect but its influence on theta cordance is unknown. METHOD: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled experiment we studied the acute effect of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) on theta cordance in a group of 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion induced a decrease in prefrontal theta cordance and an increase in the central region theta cordance after 10 and 30 min. The change in prefrontal theta cordance correlated with ketamine and norketamine blood levels after 10 min of ketamine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ketamine infusion immediately induces changes similar to those that monoamineric-based antidepressants induce gradually. The reduction in theta cordance could be a marker and a predictor of the fast-acting antidepressant effect of ketamine, a hypothesis that could be tested in depressive patients treated with ketamine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Voráčková, Veronika</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Šustová, Petra</author><author>Renka, Jiří</author><author>Mohr, Pavel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive profiles of healthy siblings of first-episode schizophrenia patients.</title><secondary-title>Early intervention in psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Early intervention in psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>554-562</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cognition</keyword><keyword>Endophenotypes</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Neuropsychological Tests</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Siblings</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32488980</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/eip.12982</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>AIM: Cognitive deficit in psychotic illness is intensively studied, different  cognitive subtypes have been suggested. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives searching for endophenotypes of the disease. The aim of our study was to investigate cognitive performance and cognitive subtypes in the siblings of the patients. METHODS: Four groups of subjects were included: patients with a first episode of psychotic illness, the siblings of these patients, and two control groups. All the study subjects (N = 84) had a battery of neuropsychological tests that measured basic cognitive domains - memory, executive functions, attention, visual-spatial skills, language skills and psychomotor speed - administered to them. The data were assessed with pairwise t-tests for group comparisons. The siblings were distributed into three groups according to their cognitive performance: non-deficit, partial deficit, and global deficit. Subsequently, the patients were assigned into three groups corresponding to their siblings' performance. RESULTS: Our results revealed attenuation of abstract thinking in the siblings compared to the controls. As expected, the patients showed impairment across all cognitive domains. The patients and siblings demonstrated similar profiles in each subtype, in the severity of their impairment, and in their patterns of cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the cognitive profile can be considered as an endophenotype of psychotic disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arrigo, Nils</author><author>de La Harpe, Marylaure</author><author>Litsios, Glenn</author><author>Zozomová-Lihová, Judita</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Marhold, Karol</author><author>Barker, Michael S</author><author>Alvarez, Nadir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is hybridization driving the evolution of climatic niche in Alyssum montanum.</title><secondary-title>American journal of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>1348-1357</pages><volume>103</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological Evolution</keyword><keyword>Brassicaceae</keyword><keyword>Climate</keyword><keyword>Diploidy</keyword><keyword>Ecology</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Geography</keyword><keyword>Hybridization, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Ploidies</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27206461</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3732/ajb.1500368</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PREMISE OF THE STUDY: After decades of interest, the contribution of  hybridization to ecological diversification remains unclear. Hybridization is a potent source of novelty, but nascent hybrid lineages must overcome reproductive and ecological competition from their parental species. Here, we assess whether hybrid speciation is advantageous over alternative modes of speciation, by comparing the geographical and ecological ranges and climatic niche evolutionary rates of stabilized allopolyploid vs. autopolyploids in the Alyssum montanum species complex. METHODS: We combined an extensive review of studies addressing the systematics and genetic diversity of A. montanum s.l., with flow cytometry and cloning of nuclear markers, to establish the ploidy level and putative hybrid nature of 205 populations. The respective geographic distribution and climatic niche evolution dynamics of the allo- and autopolyploids were investigated using multivariate analyses and comparative phylogenetic approaches. KEY RESULTS: As expected by theory, allopolyploids occur mainly along contact zones and are generally spatially overlapping with their diploid counterparts. However, they demonstrate higher rates of niche evolution and expand into different climatic conditions than those of their diploid congeners. In contrast, autopolyploids show lower rates of niche evolution, occupy ecological niches similar to their ancestors and are restricted to less competitive and peripheral geographic areas. CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization thus seems advantageous by promoting ecological niche evolution and more readily allowing escape from competitive exclusion.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Dockery, Colleen</author><author>Kopecek, Milan</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Novak, Tomas</author><author>Tislerova, Barbora</author><author>Klirova, Monika</author><author>Palenicek, Tomas</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regional brain metabolism as the predictor of performance on the Trail Making  Test in schizophrenia.

As the prerequisite analysis we compared the performance in Part A and B of the TMT between schizophrenic patients and controls. Resting brain metabolism was investigated by (18)FDG positron emission tomography (PET) as the probe for the relative regional synaptic strength and density. METHODS: (18)FDG PET data were analyzed by SPM99 with TMT A and B as the covariate (p&lt; or =0.001). RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients (N=42) had worse performance in both TMT A and B compared to controls (N=42). In schizophrenic subjects (18)FDG PET did not predict the performance on Part A (psychomotor speed) but predicted that for Part B (set-shifting and flexibility) of the TMT. The (18)FDG uptake in the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyruses bilaterally was associated with better performance in the TMT B. The negative covariation between 18FDG uptake and time spent in the TMT B was detected in the temporal and parietal cortices, pre- and postcentral gyruses, precuneus limbic regions (anterior cingulate, uncus) and the pons. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that hypometabolism in the frontal lobes and hypermetabolism in the temporo-parieto-limbic regions is the neurobiological basis for deficient TMT B performance in schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salmerón-Sánchez, Esteban</author><author>Fuertes-Aguilar, Javier</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Pérez-García, Francisco Javier</author><author>Merlo, Encarna</author><author>Garrido-Becerra, Juan Antonio</author><author>Mota, Juan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plant evolution in alkaline magnesium-rich soils: A phylogenetic study of the  Mediterranean genus Hormathophylla (Cruciferae: Alysseae) based on nuclear and plastid sequences.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0208307</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Alkalies</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Bayes Theorem</keyword><keyword>Brassicaceae</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus</keyword><keyword>Chromosomes, Plant</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Likelihood Functions</keyword><keyword>Magnesium</keyword><keyword>Mediterranean Region</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Phylogeography</keyword><keyword>Plastids</keyword><keyword>Ploidies</keyword><keyword>Ribosomes</keyword><keyword>Soil</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Trichomes</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30576314</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0208307</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Habitats with alkaline edaphic substrates are often associated with plant  speciation and diversification. The tribe Alysseae, in the family Brassicaceae, epitomizes this evolutionary trend. In this lineage, some genera, like Hormathophylla, can serve as a good case for testing the evolutionary framework. This genus is centered in the western Mediterranean. It grows on different substrates, but mostly on alkaline soils. It has been suggested that diversification in many lineages of the tribe Alysseae and in the genus Hormathophylla is linked to a tolerance for high levels of Mg+2 in xeric environments. In this study, we investigated the controversial phylogenetic placement of Hormathophylla in the tribe, the generic limits and the evolutionary relationships between the species using ribosomal and plastid DNA sequences. We also examined the putative association between the evolution of different ploidy levels, trichome morphology and the type of substrates. Our analyses demonstrated the monophyly of the genus Hormathophylla including all previously described species. Nuclear sequences revealed two lineages that differ in basic chromosome numbers (x = 7 and x = 8 or derived 11, 15) and in their trichome morphology. Contrasting results with plastid genes indicates more complex relationships between these two lineages involving recent hybridization processes. We also found an association between chloroplast haplotypes and substrate, especially in populations growing on dolomites. Finally, our dated phylogeny demonstrates that the origin of the genus took place in the mid-Miocene, during the establishment of temporal land bridges between the Tethys and Paratethys seas, with a later diversification during the upper Pliocene.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Bendova, Marie</author><author>Garakh, Zhanna</author><author>Tintera, Jaroslav</author><author>Rydlo, Jan</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In search of neural mechanisms of mirror neuron dysfunction in schizophrenia:  resting state functional connectivity approach.</title><secondary-title>Psychiatria Danubina</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychiatria Danubina</full-title></periodical><pages>S269-72</pages><volume>27 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Mapping</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Mirror Neurons</keyword><keyword>Neural Pathways</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26417778</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>It has been repeatedly shown that schizophrenia patients have immense alterations  in goal-directed behaviour, social cognition, and social interactions, cognitive abilities that are presumably driven by the mirror neurons system (MNS). However, the neural bases of these deficits still remain unclear. Along with the task-related fMRI and EEG research tapping into the mirror neuron system, the characteristics of the resting state activity in the particular areas that encompass mirror neurons might be of interest as they obviously determine the baseline of the neuronal activity. Using resting state fMRI, we investigated resting state functional connectivity (FC) in four predefined brain structures, ROIs (inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, premotor cortex and superior temporal gyrus), known for their mirror neurons activity, in 12 patients with first psychotic episode and 12 matched healthy individuals. As a specific hypothesis, based on the knowledge of the anatomical inputs of thalamus to all preselected ROIs, we have investigated the FC between thalamus and the ROIs. Of all ROIs included, seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis revealed significantly decreased FC only in left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the areas in visual cortex and cerebellum in patients as compared to controls. Using ROI-to-ROI analysis (thalamus and selected ROIs), we have found an increased FC of STG and bilateral thalamus whereas the FC of these areas was decreased in controls. Our results suggest that: (1) schizophrenia patients exhibit FC of STG which corresponds to the previously reported changes of superior temporal gyrus in schizophrenia and might contribute to the disturbances of specific functions, such as emotional processing or spatial awareness; (2) as the thalamus plays a pivotal role in the sensory gating, providing the filtering of the redundant stimulation, the observed hyperconnectivity between the thalami and the STGs in patients with schizophrenia might explain the sequential overload with sensory inputs that leads to the abnormal cognitive processing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christophoryová, Jana</author><author>Krajčovičová, Katarína</author><author>Šťáhlavský, František</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Opatova, Vera</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative Taxonomy Approach Reveals Cryptic Diversity within the Phoretic  Pseudoscorpion Genus Lamprochernes (Pseudoscorpiones: Chernetidae).</title><secondary-title>Insects</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Insects</full-title></periodical><volume>14</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36835691</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/insects14020122</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Pseudoscorpions represent an ancient, but homogeneous group of arachnids.

Our integrative approach delimited three nominal Lamprochernes species and one cryptic lineage Lamprochernes abditus sp. nov. Despite its Oligocene origin, L. abditus sp. nov. can be distinguished from its closest relative only by molecular and cytogenetic differences, or alternatively, by a complex multivariate morphometric analysis involving other Lamprochernes species.

The reasons for this heterogeneity remain unknown. Obesity is disproportionately frequent already early in the course of psychosis and is associated with smaller brain volumes. Thus, we hypothesized that obesity may contribute to brain changes in FEP. METHOD: We analyzed MRI scans from 120 participants with FEP and 114 healthy participants. In primary analyses, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with small volume corrections to regions associated with FEP or obesity in previous meta-analyses. In secondary analyses, we performed whole-brain VBM analyses. RESULTS: In primary analyses, we found that when controlling for BMI, FEP had lower GM volume than healthy participants in a) left fronto-temporal region (pTFCE = 0.008) and b) left postcentral gyrus (pTFCE = 0.043). When controlling for FEP, BMI was associated with lower GM volume in left cerebellum (pTFCE &lt; 0.001). In secondary analyses, we found that when controlling for BMI, FEP had lower GM volume than healthy participants in the a) cerebellum (pTFCE = 0.004), b) left frontal (pTFCE = 0.024), and c) right temporal cortex (pTFCE = 0.031). When controlling for FEP, BMI was associated with lower GM volume in cerebellum (pTFCE = 0.004). Levels of C-reactive protein, HDL and LDL-cholesterol correlated with obesity related neurostructural alterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that higher BMI, which is frequent in FEP, may contribute to cerebellar alterations in schizophrenia. As previous studies showed that obesity-related brain alterations may be reversible, our ﬁndings raise the possibility that improving the screening for and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic changes could preserve brain structure in FEP.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zach, Petr</author><author>Kristofiková, Zdena</author><author>Mrzílková, Jana</author><author>Majer, Emerich</author><author>Selinger, Pavel</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Rípová, Daniela</author><author>Kenney, Jana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Planum temporale analysis via a new volumetric method in autoptic brains of  demented and psychotic patients.</title><secondary-title>Current Alzheimer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Alzheimer research</full-title></periodical><pages>69-76</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Alzheimer Disease</keyword><keyword>Anthropometry</keyword><keyword>Auditory Cortex</keyword><keyword>Autopsy</keyword><keyword>Dementia</keyword><keyword>Dementia, Vascular</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Functional Laterality</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Organ Size</keyword><keyword>Pathology</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Resins, Synthetic</keyword><keyword>Sex Characteristics</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19199877</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2174/156720509787313907</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Investigations of alterations in brain asymmetry often focus on the planum  temporale of patients with schizophrenia. Data also suggest changes in laterality of demented patients associated with a more marked impairment of the left hemisphere. Our study was performed on autoptic brain tissue of 84 patients, out of which there were 25 non-demented non-psychotic controls, 50 demented patients (34 Alzheimer disease, 9 multi - infarct dementia and 7 mixed-type dementia patients) and 9 people with schizophrenia. The plana temporalia were evaluated via a new volumetric method using dental resin matter. Areas, cortical thickness and volumes of the right and left planum temporale were evaluated without normalization to brain weight in 60 patients and with normalization in 24 people. In controls, a mild right/left laterality of areas, cortical thickness and volumes was found. Moreover, in control women the areas of the left planum temporale were smaller than those observed in control men. The shifts to left/right laterality of areas and volumes were found in all demented groups. In the more numerous Alzheimer group, the change in laterality of an area was associated with a mild decrease on the right and a mild increase on the left side. In contrast, marked but only bilateral area shrinkage as well as reduced cortical thickness and brain volumes were observed in schizophrenic patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anýž, Jiří</author><author>Bakštein, Eduard</author><author>Dally, Andrea</author><author>Kolenič, Marián</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author><author>Hartmannová, Tereza</author><author>Urbanová, Kateřina</author><author>Correll, Christoph U</author><author>Novák, Daniel</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validity of the Aktibipo Self-rating Questionnaire for the Digital  Self-assessment of Mood and Relapse Detection in Patients With Bipolar Disorder: Instrument Validation Study.</title><secondary-title>JMIR mental health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JMIR mental health</full-title></periodical><pages>e26348</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34383689</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2196/26348</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Self-reported mood is a valuable clinical data source regarding  disease state and course in patients with mood disorders. However, validated, quick, and scalable digital self-report measures that can also detect relapse are still not available for clinical care. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to validate the newly developed ASERT (Aktibipo Self-rating) questionnaire-a 10-item, mobile app-based, self-report mood questionnaire consisting of 4 depression, 4 mania, and 2 nonspecific symptom items, each with 5 possible answers. The validation data set is a subset of the ongoing observational longitudinal AKTIBIPO400 study for the long-term monitoring of mood and activity (via actigraphy) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Patients with confirmed BD are included and monitored with weekly ASERT questionnaires and monthly clinical scales (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] and Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS]). METHODS: The content validity of the ASERT questionnaire was assessed using principal component analysis, and the Cronbach α was used to assess the internal consistency of each factor. The convergent validity of the depressive or manic items of the ASERT questionnaire with the MADRS and YMRS, respectively, was assessed using a linear mixed-effects model and linear correlation analyses. In addition, we investigated the capability of the ASERT questionnaire to distinguish relapse (YMRS≥15 and MADRS≥15) from a nonrelapse (interepisode) state (YMRS&lt;15 and MADRS&lt;15) using a logistic mixed-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients with BD were included in this study (follow-up: mean 754 days, SD 266) and completed an average of 78.1% (SD 18.3%) of the requested ASERT assessments (completion time for the 10 ASERT questions: median 24.0 seconds) across all patients in this study. The ASERT depression items were highly associated with MADRS total scores (P&lt;.001; bootstrap). Similarly, ASERT mania items were highly associated with YMRS total scores (P&lt;.001; bootstrap). Furthermore, the logistic mixed-effects regression model for scale-based relapse detection showed high detection accuracy in a repeated holdout validation for both depression (accuracy=85%; sensitivity=69.9%; specificity=88.4%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.880) and mania (accuracy=87.5%; sensitivity=64.9%; specificity=89.9%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.844). CONCLUSIONS: The ASERT questionnaire is a quick and acceptable mood monitoring tool that is administered via a smartphone app. The questionnaire has a good capability to detect the worsening of clinical symptoms in a long-term monitoring scenario.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mráz, Patrik</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Skokanová, Katarína</author><author>Šingliarová, Barbora</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal stability of spatial cytotype structure in mixed-ploidy populations of  Centaurea stoebe.</title><secondary-title>AoB PLANTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AoB PLANTS</full-title></periodical><pages>plac052</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36439406</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/aobpla/plac052</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Spatial segregation of cytotypes reduces the negative effect of  frequency-dependent mating on the fitness of minority cytotype(s) and thus allows its establishment and coexistence with the majority cytotype in mixed-ploidy populations. Despite its evolutionary importance, the stability of spatial segregation is largely unknown. Furthermore, closely related sympatric cytotypes that differ in their life histories might exhibit contrasting spatial dynamics over time. We studied the temporal stability of spatial structure at a secondary contact zone of co-occurring monocarpic diploids and polycarpic tetraploids of Centaurea stoebe, whose tetraploid cytotype has undergone a rapid range expansion in Europe and became invasive in North America. Eleven years after the initial screening, we re-assessed the microspatial distribution of diploids and tetraploids and their affinities to varying vegetation-cover density in three mixed-ploidy populations in Central Europe. We found that overall, spatial patterns and frequencies of both cytotypes in all sites were very similar over time, with one exception. At one site, in one previously purely 2x patch, diploids completely disappeared due to intensive succession by shrubby vegetation. The remaining spatial patterns, however, showed the same cytotype clumping and higher frequency of 2x despite subtle changes in vegetation-cover densities. In contrast to the expected expansion of polycarpic tetraploids having higher colonization ability when compared to diploids, the tetraploids remained confined to their former microsites and showed no spatial expansion. Spatial patterns of coexisting diploids and tetraploids, which exhibit contrasting life histories, did not change over more than a decade. Such temporal stability is likely caused by relatively stable habitat conditions and very limited seed dispersal. Our results thus imply that in the absence of a disturbance regime connected with frequent human- or animal-mediated seed dispersal, spatial patterns may be very stable over time, thus contributing to the long-term coexistence of cytotypes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melicher, T</author><author>Horacek, J</author><author>Hlinka, J</author><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Tintera, J</author><author>Ibrahim, I</author><author>Mikolas, P</author><author>Novak, T</author><author>Mohr, P</author><author>Hoschl, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>White matter changes in first episode psychosis and their relation to the size of  sample studied: a DTI study.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia research</full-title></periodical><pages>22-28</pages><volume>162</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Anisotropy</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Diffusion Tensor Imaging</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Sample Size</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>White Matter</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25660467</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.schres.2015.01.029</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: White matter abnormality has been recently proposed as a  pathophysiological feature of schizophrenia (SZ). However, most of the data available has been gathered from chronic patients, and was therefore possibly confounded by factors such as duration of the disease, and treatment received. The extent and localization of these changes is also not clear. METHODS: We examined a population of early stage SZ patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 77 SZ patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). We have also analyzed 250 randomly created subsets of the original cohort, to investigate the relation between the result of TBSS analysis, and the size of the sample studied. RESULTS: We have found a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the patient group. This change is present in most major white matter (WM) tracts including the corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and posterior thalamic radiation. Furthermore, we identified a clear trend towards an increase in the number and spatial extent of significant voxels reported, with an increasing number of subjects included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that FA is significantly decreased in patients at an early stage of schizophrenia, and that the extent of this finding is dependent on the size of studied sample; therefore underpowered studies might produce results with false spatial localization.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Flegr, Jaroslav</author><author>Tintera, Jaroslav</author><author>Verebova, Karin</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Novak, Tomas</author><author>Brunovsky, Martin</author><author>Bubenikova-Valesova, Vera</author><author>Holub, David</author><author>Palenicek, Tomas</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Latent toxoplasmosis reduces gray matter density in schizophrenia but not in  controls: voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) study.</title><secondary-title>The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World  Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World  Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>501-509</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Mapping</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe</keyword><keyword>Thalamus</keyword><keyword>Toxoplasmosis, Cerebral</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21599563</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/15622975.2011.573809</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To address the role of latent T. gondii infection in schizophrenia we  studied the influence of latent toxoplasmosis on brain morphology. METHODS: An optimized voxel-based morphometry of magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed by analysis of variance with diagnosis and seropositivity as factors in 44 schizophrenic patients (12 T. gondii positive) and 56 controls (13 T. gondii positive). RESULTS: Grey matter (GM) volume was reduced in schizophrenia patients compared with controls in the cortical regions, hippocampus and in the caudate. In the schizophrenia sample we found a significant reduction of GM volume in T. gondii positive comparing with T. gondii-negative patients bilaterally in the caudate, median cingulate, thalamus and occipital cortex and in the left cerebellar hemispheres. T. gondii-positive and -negative controls did not differ in any cluster. Among participants seropositive to T. gondii the reduction of GM in the schizophrenia subjects was located in the same regions when comparing the entire sample (11,660 over-threshold voxels (P ≤ 0.05, FWR corrected). The differences between T. gondii-negative patients and controls consisted only of 289 voxels in temporal regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to document that latent toxoplasmosis reduces GM in schizophrenia but not in controls.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monteiro, Caio</author><author>Ferreira, Lorena Lopes</author><author>de Paula, Luiza Gabriella Ferreira</author><author>de Oliveira Filho, Jaires Gomes</author><author>de Oliveira Silva, Fernanda</author><author>Muniz, Elen Regozino</author><author>Menezes, Karolina Martins Ferreira</author><author>de Camargo, Fabrício Rômulo</author><author>de Oliveira Nonato, Rhayssa</author><author>Martins, Danieli Brolo</author><author>Marreto, Ricardo Neves</author><author>Borges, Lígia Miranda Ferreira</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thymol and eugenol microemulsion for Rhiphicephalus sanguineus sensu lato  control: Formulation development, field efficacy, and safety on dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary parasitology</full-title></periodical><pages>109501</pages><volume>296</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Emulsions</keyword><keyword>Eugenol</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Larva</keyword><keyword>Nymph</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</keyword><keyword>Safety</keyword><keyword>Thymol</keyword><keyword>Tick Infestations</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34147769</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vetpar.2021.109501</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The present study aimed to develop a microemulsion formulation containing thymol  and eugenol for field control of Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato on dogs, as well to evaluate its safety and the physical characteristics of the formulation. The microemulsion using thymol and eugenol (5.0 + 5.0 mg/mL) had as vehicles water, propylene glycol, polysorbate 80 and canola oil. On the next day the preparation (formulation freshly prepared) and after 24 months, the size of the microemulsion droplets, polydispersion index (PdI), organoleptic properties (color, viscosity), and presence of precipitate in the microemulsion were evaluated. For the field assay, on day -1, 10 English Cocker Spaniel dogs were experimentally infested with 200 larvae, 100 nymphs and 30 adults of R. sanguineus s.l. On day 0, after tick counts, the animals were divided into two groups: treated with the freshly prepared microemulsion (10 mL/kg), and control, which received the vehicle (10 mL/kg). Tick counts on dogs were performed daily for three more days. Engorged females were recovered from the dogs and their biological and reproductive parameters were monitored. The dogs' clinical parameters (temperature, mucosa color, and general physical condition) were evaluated daily. In addition, blood samples were collected before infestation to verify hematological (packed cell volume) and biochemical parameters (total serum protein, albumin, globulins, creatinine, urea, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase). Freshly prepared and 24-month aged microemulsions had droplets with mean sizes of 30.94 nm and 27.93 nm, and PdI values of 0.214 and 0.161, respectively. In addition, no difference in the organoleptic properties and no precipitation formation were observed, indicating physical stability. Treatment with the microemulsion resulted in reduction of larvae (p &lt; 0.05) parasitizing the dogs on day 1 while the number of nymphs and adults was not reduced (P&gt; 0.05). In the evaluation of the reproductive biology of engorged females, the larval hatchability (%) was compromised (p &lt; 0.05), and the microemulsion had control rate of 85.5 %. The microemulsion and its vehicles did not change the clinical, hematological and biochemical parameters of the dogs. We concluded that the microemulsion was efficient against R. sanguineus s.l. by reducing the number of larvae and affecting the reproductive parameters of engorged females, safe for dogs, and stable (physical stability) during a two-year interval.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hajek, Tomas</author><author>Franke, Katja</author><author>Kolenic, Marian</author><author>Capkova, Jana</author><author>Matejka, Martin</author><author>Propper, Lukas</author><author>Uher, Rudolf</author><author>Stopkova, Pavla</author><author>Novak, Tomas</author><author>Paus, Tomas</author><author>Kopecek, Miloslav</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Alda, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brain Age in Early Stages of Bipolar Disorders or Schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>190-198</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Bipolar Disorder</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>29272464</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/schbul/sbx172</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The greater presence of neurodevelopmental antecedants may  differentiate schizophrenia from bipolar disorders (BD). Machine learning/pattern recognition allows us to estimate the biological age of the brain from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI). The discrepancy between brain and chronological age could contribute to early detection and differentiation of BD and schizophrenia. METHODS: We estimated brain age in 2 studies focusing on early stages of schizophrenia or BD. In the first study, we recruited 43 participants with first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (FES) and 43 controls. In the second study, we included 96 offspring of bipolar parents (48 unaffected, 48 affected) and 60 controls. We used relevance vector regression trained on an independent sample of 504 controls to estimate the brain age of study participants from structural MRI. We calculated the brain-age gap estimate (BrainAGE) score by subtracting the chronological age from the brain age. RESULTS: Participants with FES had higher BrainAGE scores than controls (F(1, 83) = 8.79, corrected P = .008, Cohen's d = 0.64). Their brain age was on average 2.64 ± 4.15 years greater than their chronological age (matched t(42) = 4.36, P &lt; .001). In contrast, participants at risk or in the early stages of BD showed comparable BrainAGE scores to controls (F(2,149) = 1.04, corrected P = .70, η2 = 0.01) and comparable brain and chronological age. CONCLUSIONS: Early stages of schizophrenia, but not early stages of BD, were associated with advanced BrainAGE scores. Participants with FES showed neurostructural alterations, which made their brains appear 2.64 years older than their chronological age. BrainAGE scores could aid in early differential diagnosis between BD and schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zozomová-Lihová, Judita</author><author>Krak, Karol</author><author>Mandáková, Terezie</author><author>Shimizu, Kentaro K</author><author>Spaniel, Stanislav</author><author>Vít, Petr</author><author>Lysak, Martin A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple hybridization events in Cardamine (Brassicaceae) during the last 150  years: revisiting a textbook example of neoallopolyploidy.</title><secondary-title>Annals of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>817-830</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological Evolution</keyword><keyword>Cardamine</keyword><keyword>DNA, Plant</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Hybridization, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Microsatellite Repeats</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Polyploidy</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Switzerland</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24577071</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/aob/mcu012</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recently formed allopolyploid species represent excellent  subjects for exploring early stages of polyploid evolution. The hexaploid Cardamine schulzii was regarded as one of the few nascent allopolyploid species formed within the past ∼150 years that presumably arose by autopolyploidization of a triploid hybrid, C. × insueta; however, the most recent investigations have shown that it is a trigenomic hybrid. The aims of this study were to explore the efficiency of progenitor-specific microsatellite markers in detecting the hybrid origins and genome composition of these two allopolyploids, to estimate the frequency of polyploid formation events, and to outline their evolutionary potential for long-term persistence and speciation. METHODS: Flow-cytometric ploidy-level screening and genotyping by progenitor-specific microsatellite markers (20 microsatellite loci) were carried out on samples focused on hybridizing populations at Urnerboden, Switzerland, but also including comparative material of the parental species from other sites in the Alps and more distant areas. KEY RESULTS: It was confirmed that hybridization between the diploids C. amara and C. rivularis auct. gave rise to triploid C. × insueta, and it is inferred that this has occurred repeatedly. Evidence is provided that C. schulzii comprises three parental genomes and supports its origin from hybridization events between C. × insueta and the locally co-occurring hypotetraploid C. pratensis, leading to two cytotypes of C. schulzii: hypopentaploid and hypohexaploid. Each cytotype of C. schulzii is genetically uniform, suggesting their single origins. CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of C. schulzii has presumably been achieved only by perennial growth and clonal reproduction. This contrasts with C. × insueta, in which multiple origins and occasional sexual reproduction have generated sufficient genetic variation for long-term survival and evolutionary success. This study illustrates a complex case of recurrent hybridization and polyploidization events, and highlights the role of triploids that promoted the origin of trigenomic hybrids.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Brunovsky, Martin</author><author>Novak, Tomas</author><author>Skrdlantova, Lucie</author><author>Klirova, Monika</author><author>Bubenikova-Valesova, Vera</author><author>Krajca, Vladimir</author><author>Tislerova, Barbora</author><author>Kopecek, Milan</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Mohr, Pavel</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of low-frequency rTMS on electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and regional  brain metabolism (PET) in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations.</title><secondary-title>Neuropsychobiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuropsychobiology</full-title></periodical><pages>132-142</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Mapping</keyword><keyword>Electric Stimulation</keyword><keyword>Electroencephalography</keyword><keyword>Electromagnetic Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorodeoxyglucose F18</keyword><keyword>Hallucinations</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Tomography, Emission-Computed</keyword><keyword>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>radiation effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17641545</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000106055</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Auditory hallucinations are characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia  with high clinical importance. It was repeatedly reported that low frequency (&lt;or=1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) diminishes treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations. A neuroimaging study elucidating the effect of rTMS in auditory hallucinations has yet to be published. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution of neuronal electrical activity and the brain metabolism changes after low-frequency rTMS in patients with auditory hallucinations. METHODS: Low-frequency rTMS (0.9 Hz, 100% of motor threshold, 20 min) applied to the left temporoparietal cortex was used for 10 days in the treatment of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia (n = 12). The effect of rTMS on the low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and brain metabolism ((18)FDG PET) was measured before and after 2 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: We found a significant improvement in the total and positive symptoms (PANSS), and on the hallucination scales (HCS, AHRS). The rTMS decreased the brain metabolism in the left superior temporal gyrus and in interconnected regions, and effected increases in the contralateral cortex and in the frontal lobes. We detected a decrease in current densities (LORETA) for the beta-1 and beta-3 bands in the left temporal lobe whereas an increase was found for beta-2 band contralaterally. CONCLUSION: Our findings implicate that the effect is connected with decreased metabolism in the cortex underlying the rTMS site, while facilitation of metabolism is propagated by transcallosal and intrahemispheric connections. The LORETA indicates that the neuroplastic changes affect the functional laterality and provide the substrate for a metabolic effect.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez, Mabel</author><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Cvrčková, Aneta</author><author>Dvořaček, Boris</author><author>Dorazilová, Aneta</author><author>Jonáš, Juraj</author><author>Šustová, Petra</author><author>Voráčková, Veronika</author><author>Hájková, Marie</author><author>Kratochvílová, Zuzana</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Mohr, Pavel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive Profiles and Functional Connectivity in First-Episode Schizophrenia  Spectrum Disorders - Linking Behavioral and Neuronal Data.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in psychology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in psychology</full-title></periodical><pages>689</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31001171</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00689</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The character of cognitive deficit in schizophrenia is not clear due to the  heterogeneity in research results. In heterogeneous conditions, the cluster solution allows the classification of individuals based on profiles. Our aim was to examine the cognitive profiles of first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder (FES) subjects based on cluster analysis, and to correlate these profiles with clinical variables and resting state brain connectivity, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 67 FES subjects were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery and on clinical variables. The results of the cognitive domains were cluster analyzed. In addition, functional connectivity was calculated using ROI-to-ROI analysis with four groups: Three groups were defined based on the cluster analysis of cognitive performance and a control group with a normal cognitive performance. The connectivity was compared between the patient clusters and controls. We found different cognitive profiles based on three clusters: Cluster 1: decline in the attention, working memory/flexibility, and verbal memory domains. Cluster 2: decline in the verbal memory domain and above average performance in the attention domain. Cluster 3: generalized and severe deficit in all of the cognitive domains. FES diagnoses were distributed among all of the clusters. Cluster comparisons in neural connectivity also showed differences between the groups. Cluster 1 showed both hyperconnectivity between the cerebellum and precentral gyrus, the salience network (SN) (insula cortex), and fronto-parietal network (FPN) as well as between the PreCG and SN (insula cortex) and hypoconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and seeds of SN [insula and supramarginal gyrus (SMG)]; Cluster 2 showed hyperconnectivity between the DMN and cerebellum, SN (insula) and precentral gyrus, and FPN and IFG; Cluster 3 showed hypoconnectivity between the DMN and SN (insula) and SN (SMG) and pallidum. The cluster solution confirms the prevalence of a cognitive decline with different patterns of cognitive performance, and different levels of severity in FES. Moreover, separate behavioral cognitive subsets can be linked to patterns of brain functional connectivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sudová, Radka</author><author>Kohout, Petr</author><author>Kolaříková, Zuzana</author><author>Rydlová, Jana</author><author>Voříšková, Jana</author><author>Suda, Jan</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Müller-Schärer, Heinz</author><author>Mráz, Patrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sympatric diploid and tetraploid cytotypes of Centaurea stoebe s.l. do not differ  in arbuscular mycorrhizal communities and mycorrhizal growth response.</title><secondary-title>American journal of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>1995-2007</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Centaurea</keyword><keyword>Diploidy</keyword><keyword>Fertilizers</keyword><keyword>Mycorrhizae</keyword><keyword>Tetraploidy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30552673</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ajb2.1206</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Genome duplication is associated with multiple changes at  different levels, including interactions with pollinators and herbivores. Yet little is known whether polyploidy may also shape belowground interactions. METHODS: To elucidate potential ploidy-specific interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), we compared mycorrhizal colonization and assembly of AMF communities in roots of diploid and tetraploid Centaurea stoebe s.l. (Asteraceae) co-occurring in a Central European population. In a follow-up greenhouse experiment, we tested inter-cytotype differences in mycorrhizal growth response by combining ploidy, substrate, and inoculation with native AMF in a full-factorial design. KEY RESULTS: All sampled plants were highly colonized by AMF, with the Glomeraceae predominating. AMF-community composition revealed by 454-pyrosequencing reflected the spatial distribution of the hosts, but not their ploidy level or soil characteristics. In the greenhouse experiment, the tetraploids produced more shoot biomass than the diploids did when grown in a more fertile substrate, while no inter-cytotype differences were found in a less fertile substrate. AMF inoculation significantly reduced plant growth and improved P uptake, but its effects did not differ between the cytotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support our hypotheses that the cytotype structure in a mixed-ploidy population of C. stoebe is mirrored in AMF-community composition and that ploidy-specific fungal communities contribute to cytotype co-existence. Causes and implications of the observed negative growth response to AMF are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klirova, Monika</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Novak, Tomas</author><author>Cermak, Jan</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Skrdlantova, Lucie</author><author>Mohr, Pavel</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Individualized rTMS neuronavigated according to regional brain metabolism  ((18)FGD PET) has better treatment effects on auditory hallucinations than standard positioning of rTMS: a double-blind, sham-controlled study.</title><secondary-title>European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>475-484</pages><volume>263</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Cross-Over Studies</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorodeoxyglucose F18</keyword><keyword>Hallucinations</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Imaging, Three-Dimensional</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Neuronavigation</keyword><keyword>Positron-Emission Tomography</keyword><keyword>Psychiatric Status Rating Scales</keyword><keyword>Psychometrics</keyword><keyword>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>22983355</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00406-012-0368-x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) of the left  temporo-parietal cortex (LTPC) has been proposed as a useful therapeutic method for auditory hallucinations (AHs). Stereotactic neuronavigation enables the magnetic coil to be targeted according to the individual parameters obtained from neuroimaging. Individualized rTMS neuronavigated according to 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG PET) allows us to focus the coil explicitly on a given area with detected maxima of specific abnormalities, thus presuming a higher therapeutic effect of the method. The objective of this study is to test clinical efficacy of neuronavigated LF-rTMS administered according to the local maxima of (18)FDG PET uptake of LTPC and to compare it with treatment effects of standard and sham rTMS. In a double-blind, sham-controlled design, patients with AHs underwent a 10-day series of LF-rTMS using (1) (18)FDG PET-guided &quot;neuronavigation,&quot; (2) &quot;standard&quot; anatomically guided positioning, and (3) sham coil. The effect of different rTMS conditions was assessed by the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Fifteen patients were randomized to a treatment sequence and ten of them completed all three treatment conditions. The intention-to-treat analysis of AHRS score change revealed superiority of the (18)FDG PET-guided rTMS over both the standard and the sham rTMS. The analyses of the PANSS scores failed to detect significant difference among the treatments. Our data showed acute efficacy of (18)FDG PET-guided rTMS in the treatment of AHs. Neuronavigated rTMS was found to be more effective than standard, anatomically guided rTMS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Garakh, Zhanna</author><author>Novototsky-Vlasov, Vladimir</author><author>Gurovich, Isaac Ya</author><author>Shmukler, Alexander</author><author>Papaefstathiou, Anna</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Strelets, Valeria B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EEG coherence in a mental arithmetic task performance in first episode  schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.</title><secondary-title>Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of  Clinical Neurophysiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of  Clinical Neurophysiology</full-title></periodical><pages>2315-2324</pages><volume>129</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain Waves</keyword><keyword>Cognition</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intelligence Tests</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mathematics</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30240977</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.clinph.2018.08.020</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the coherence values of the cortical bands in patients  with first episode schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder during the performance of a mental arithmetic task. METHOD: We analysed EEG coherence in the resting state and subsequently while counting down from 200 in steps of 7 in 32 first episode schizophrenia patients (SZ), 32 patients with first episode schizoaffective disorder (SA) and 40 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Task performance in HC is characterised by decreased coherence in the alpha bands and increased coherence in the beta 2 and gamma bands in frontal sites. In SZ, coherence decreases in the alpha band, whereas in SA it substantially increases in the alpha, beta1, beta 2 and gamma bands. CONCLUSIONS: Despite no differences in performance on a behavioural level, SA patients demonstrate a paradoxical increase in both low and fast frequency bands during the performance of a mental arithmetic task, while, patients with SZ show a decreased coherence in the alpha band, presumably alluding to the excessive excitatory (in SA) and inhibitory (in SZ) mechanisms in cognitive processing. SIGNIFICANCE: The current study provides evidence for the distinction of neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive processing between SZ and SA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dluhoš, Petr</author><author>Schwarz, Daniel</author><author>Cahn, Wiepke</author><author>van Haren, Neeltje</author><author>Kahn, René</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author><author>Kašpárek, Tomáš</author><author>Schnack, Hugo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-center machine learning in imaging psychiatry: A meta-model approach.</title><secondary-title>NeuroImage</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NeuroImage</full-title></periodical><pages>10-24</pages><volume>155</volume><keywords><keyword>Datasets as Topic</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Multicenter Studies as Topic</keyword><keyword>Neuroimaging</keyword><keyword>Pattern Recognition, Automated</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Support Vector Machine</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28428048</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.027</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>One of the biggest problems in automated diagnosis of psychiatric disorders from  medical images is the lack of sufficiently large samples for training. Sample size is especially important in the case of highly heterogeneous disorders such as schizophrenia, where machine learning models built on relatively low numbers of subjects may suffer from poor generalizability. Via multicenter studies and consortium initiatives researchers have tried to solve this problem by combining data sets from multiple sites. The necessary sharing of (raw) data is, however, often hindered by legal and ethical issues. Moreover, in the case of very large samples, the computational complexity might become too large. The solution to this problem could be distributed learning. In this paper we investigated the possibility to create a meta-model by combining support vector machines (SVM) classifiers trained on the local datasets, without the need for sharing medical images or any other personal data. Validation was done in a 4-center setup comprising of 480 first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in total. We built SVM models to separate patients from controls based on three different kinds of imaging features derived from structural MRI scans, and compared models built on the joint multicenter data to the meta-models. The results showed that the combined meta-model had high similarity to the model built on all data pooled together and comparable classification performance on all three imaging features. Both similarity and performance was superior to that of the local models. We conclude that combining models is thus a viable alternative that facilitates data sharing and creating bigger and more informative models.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Banerjee, Ranjan</author><author>He, Jun</author><author>Spaniel, Carolyn</author><author>Quintana, Megan T</author><author>Wang, Zhongjing</author><author>Bain, James</author><author>Newgard, Christopher B</author><author>Muehlbauer, Michael J</author><author>Willis, Monte S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of cardiac Muscle Ring Finger-1 (MuRF1),  MuRF2, and MuRF3 in vivo reveals novel and redundant metabolic changes.</title><secondary-title>Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society</full-title></periodical><pages>312-322</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>28325996</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11306-014-0695-1</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases MuRF1, MuRF2, MuRF3 have been reported to  have overlapping substrate specificities, interacting with each other as well as proteins involved in metabolism and cardiac function. In the heart, all three MuRF family proteins have proven critical to cardiac responses to ischemia and heart failure. The non-targeted metabolomics analysis of MuRF1-/-, MuRF2-/-, and MuRF3-/- hearts was initiated to investigate the hypothesis that MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3 have a similarly altered metabolome, representing alterations in overlapping metabolic processes. Ventricular tissue was flash frozen and quantitatively analyzed by GC/MS using a library built upon the Fiehn GC/MS Metabolomics RTL Library. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis identified significant differences (via VIP statistical analysis) in taurine, myoinositol, and stearic acid for the three MuRF-/- phenotypes relative to their matched controls. Moreover, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that MuRF1-/- had significant changes in metabolite(s) involved in taurine metabolism and primary acid biosynthesis while MuRF2-/- had changes associated with ascorbic acid/aldarate metabolism (via VIP and t-test analysis vs. sibling-matched wildtype controls). By identifying the functional metabolic consequences of MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3 in the intact heart, non-targeted metabolomics analysis discovered common pathways functionally affected by cardiac MuRF family proteins in vivo. These novel metabolomics findings will aid in guiding the molecular studies delineating the mechanisms that MuRF family proteins regulate metabolic pathways. Understanding these mechanism is an important key to understanding MuRF family proteins' protective effects on the heart during cardiac disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iyer, Sravisht</author><author>Donnelly, Patrick E</author><author>Spaniel, George</author><author>Young, Kelsey</author><author>Oh, Kevin</author><author>Cunningham, Matthew E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Locally Applied Simvastatin as an Adjunct to Promote Spinal Fusion in Rats.</title><secondary-title>Spine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Spine</full-title></periodical><pages>1042-1048</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ilium</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Osteogenesis</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Rats, Wistar</keyword><keyword>Simvastatin</keyword><keyword>Spinal Fusion</keyword><keyword>X-Ray Microtomography</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>transplantation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30896582</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/BRS.0000000000003020</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>STUDY DESIGN: Basic Science. OBJECTIVE: To determine if locally delivered  simvastatin can enhance bone formation in a rat spinal fusion model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The bone-anabolic properties of statins in fracture healing are well established, however, few studies have evaluated the impact of locally delivered statins in spinal fusion. METHODS: We formulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles by adapting previously published techniques. Two types of nanoparticles were created: simvastatin nanoparticles (SimNP) and nanoparticles without simvastatin (BlankNP). Drug elution from SimNP was characterized. Osteoblastic differentiation was analyzed using MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in differentiation medium containing SimNP or BlankNP. Forty male 12 week old outbred Wistar rats underwent uninstrumented posterolateral fusion using iliac crest bone graft and BlankNP, SimNP or simvastatin drug. X-rays to assess bone formation were obtained at 4 weeks and 9 weeks post-operatively. Spines were explanted at 9 weeks for micro-CT analysis, and a blinded manual assessment of fusion (MAF). RESULTS: SimNP achieved a release efficiency of 74.1% with ∼50% release occurring in the first day. Simvastatin and SimNP treated cells showed significantly greater expression of osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN). On micro-CT analysis, SimNP animals had higher bone volume and percent bone volume (bone volume/total volume) than control animals. SimNP rats had higher X-ray scores at 4 weeks (p=0.010) and 9 weeks (p&lt;0.001) relative to BlankNP. MAF showed that SimNP had a higher fusion rate than BlankNP (42.9% vs. 0%, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: We were able to validate that sustained release of simvastatin via a PLGA nanoparticle. SimNP was able to induce an increase in mineralization as well as an increase in markers of bone formation. X-ray analysis, micro-CT quantification, and MAF assessment of SimNP treated rats showed significantly greater bone formation and fusion mass strength relative to vehicle treated animals. Simvastatin may be a safe, cost-effective bone anabolic agent for use in spinal fusion.

Widespread heterogeneity of results from studies published to date preclude any definitive characterization of the relationship between white matter and cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Given the relevance of deficits in cognitive function to predicting social and functional outcomes in schizophrenia, the authors carried out a meta-analysis of available data through the ENIGMA Consortium, using a common analysis pipeline, to elucidate the relationship between white matter microstructure and a measure of general cognitive performance, IQ, in patients with schizophrenia and healthy participants. METHODS: The meta-analysis included 760 patients with schizophrenia and 957 healthy participants from 11 participating ENIGMA Consortium sites. For each site, principal component analysis was used to calculate both a global fractional anisotropy component (gFA) and a fractional anisotropy component for six long association tracts (LA-gFA) previously associated with cognition. RESULTS: Meta-analyses of regression results indicated that gFA accounted for a significant amount of variation in cognition in the full sample (effect size [Hedges' g]=0.27, CI=0.17-0.36), with similar effects sizes observed for both the patient (effect size=0.20, CI=0.05-0.35) and healthy participant groups (effect size=0.32, CI=0.18-0.45). Comparable patterns of association were also observed between LA-gFA and cognition for the full sample (effect size=0.28, CI=0.18-0.37), the patient group (effect size=0.23, CI=0.09-0.38), and the healthy participant group (effect size=0.31, CI=0.18-0.44). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides robust evidence that cognitive ability is associated with global structural connectivity, with higher fractional anisotropy associated with higher IQ. This association was independent of diagnosis; while schizophrenia patients tended to have lower fractional anisotropy and lower IQ than healthy participants, the comparable size of effect in each group suggested a more general, rather than disease-specific, pattern of association.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author><author>Fajnerová, Iveta</author><author>Androvičová, Renata</author><author>Tintěra, Jaroslav</author><author>Salvi, Virginio</author><author>Balíková, Marie</author><author>Hložek, Tomáš</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Páleníček, Tomáš</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cannabis-induced altered states of consciousness are associated with specific  dynamic brain connectivity states.</title><secondary-title>Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>811-821</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dronabinol</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hallucinogens</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Marijuana Smoking</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31154891</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0269881119849814</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cannabis, and specifically one of its active compounds  delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in recreational doses, has a variety of effects on cognitive processes. Most studies employ resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to assess the stationary effects of cannabis and to-date one report addressed the impact of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on the dynamics of whole-brain functional connectivity. METHODS: Using a repeated-measures, within-subjects design, 19 healthy occasional cannabis users (smoking cannabis ⩽2 per week) underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Each subject underwent two scans: in the intoxicated condition, shortly after smoking a cannabis cigarette, and in the non-intoxicated condition, with the subject being free from cannabinoids for at least one week before. All sessions were randomized and performed in a four-week interval. Data were analysed employing a standard independent component analysis approach with subsequent tracking of the functional connectivity dynamics, which allowed six connectivity clusters (states) to be individuated. RESULTS: Using standard independent component analysis in resting state functional connectivity, a group effect was found in the precuneus connectivity. With a dynamic independent component analysis approach, we identified one transient connectivity state, characterized by high connectivity within and between auditory and somato-motor cortices and anti-correlation with subcortical structures and the cerebellum that was only found during the intoxicated condition. Behavioural measures of the subjective experiences of changed perceptions and tetrahydrocannabinol plasma levels during intoxication were associated with this state. CONCLUSIONS: With the help of the dynamic connectivity approach we could elucidate neural correlates of the transitory perceptual changes induced by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis users, and possibly identify a biomarker of cannabis intoxication.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirschfeldova, Katerina</author><author>Cerny, Jiri</author><author>Bozikova, Paulina</author><author>Kuchtiak, Viktor</author><author>Rausch, Tobias</author><author>Benes, Vladimir</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Gregus, David</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Vyklicky, Ladislav</author><author>Balik, Ales</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence for the Association between the Intronic Haplotypes of Ionotropic  Glutamate Receptors and First-Episode Schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of personalized medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of personalized medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34945722</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jpm11121250</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The heritable component of schizophrenia (SCH) as a polygenic trait is  represented by numerous variants from a heterogeneous group of genes each contributing a relatively small effect. Various SNPs have already been found and analyzed in genes encoding the NMDAR subunits. However, less is known about genetic variations of genes encoding the AMPA and kainate receptor subunits. We analyzed sixteen iGluR genes in full length to determine the sequence variability of iGluR genes. Our aim was to describe the rate of genetic variability, its distribution, and the co-occurrence of variants and to identify new candidate risk variants or haplotypes. The cumulative effect of genetic risk was then estimated using a simple scoring model. GRIN2A-B, GRIN3A-B, and GRIK4 genes showed significantly increased genetic variation in SCH patients. The fixation index statistic revealed eight intronic haplotypes and an additional four intronic SNPs within the sequences of iGluR genes associated with SCH (p &lt; 0.05). The haplotypes were used in the proposed simple scoring model and moreover as a test for genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. The positive likelihood ratio for the scoring model test reached 7.11. We also observed 41 protein-altering variants (38 missense variants, four frameshifts, and one nonsense variant) that were not significantly associated with SCH. Our data suggest that some intronic regulatory regions of iGluR genes and their common variability are among the components from which the genetic predisposition to SCH is composed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mattox, Taylor A</author><author>Young, Martin E</author><author>Rubel, Carrie E</author><author>Spaniel, Carolyn</author><author>Rodríguez, Jessica E</author><author>Grevengoed, Trisha J</author><author>Gautel, Mathias</author><author>Xu, Zhelong</author><author>Anderson, Ethan J</author><author>Willis, Monte S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MuRF1 activity is present in cardiac mitochondria and regulates reactive oxygen  species production in vivo.</title><secondary-title>Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes</full-title></periodical><pages>173-187</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Citric Acid Cycle</keyword><keyword>Energy Metabolism</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Knockout</keyword><keyword>Mitochondria, Heart</keyword><keyword>Muscle Proteins</keyword><keyword>Oxygen</keyword><keyword>Oxygen Consumption</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Tripartite Motif Proteins</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24733503</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10863-014-9549-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>MuRF1 is a previously reported ubiquitin-ligase found in striated muscle that  targets troponin I and myosin heavy chain for degradation. While MuRF1 has been reported to interact with mitochondrial substrates in yeast two-hybrid studies, no studies have identified MuRF1's role in regulating mitochondrial function to date. In the present study, we measured cardiac mitochondrial function from isolated permeabilized muscle fibers in previously phenotyped MuRF1 transgenic and MuRF1-/- mouse models to determine the role of MuRF1 in intermediate energy metabolism and ROS production. We identified a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production in cardiac muscle fibers from MuRF1 transgenic mice with increased α-MHC driven MuRF1 expression. Increased MuRF1 expression in ex vivo and in vitro experiments revealed no alterations in the respiratory chain complex I and II function. Working perfusion experiments on MuRF1 transgenic hearts demonstrated significant changes in glucose oxidation. However, total oxygen consumption was decreased [corrected]. This data provides evidence for MuRF1 as a novel regulator of cardiac ROS, offering another mechanism by which increased MuRF1 expression may be cardioprotective in ischemia reperfusion injury, in addition to its inhibition of apoptosis via proteasome-mediate degradation of c-Jun. The lack of mitochondrial function phenotype identified in MuRF1-/- hearts may be due to the overlapping interactions of MuRF1 and MuRF2 with energy regulating proteins found by yeast two-hybrid studies reported here, implying a duplicity in MuRF1 and MuRF2's regulation of mitochondrial function.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shimakami, Tetsuro</author><author>Yamane, Daisuke</author><author>Jangra, Rohit K</author><author>Kempf, Brian J</author><author>Spaniel, Carolyn</author><author>Barton, David J</author><author>Lemon, Stanley M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stabilization of hepatitis C virus RNA by an Ago2-miR-122 complex.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>941-946</pages><volume>109</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>5' Untranslated Regions</keyword><keyword>Argonaute Proteins</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Genome, Viral</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Hepacivirus</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Methylation</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>RNA Caps</keyword><keyword>RNA Stability</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22215596</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1112263109</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate eukaryotic gene  expression by binding to regions of imperfect complementarity in mRNAs, typically in the 3' UTR, recruiting an Argonaute (Ago) protein complex that usually results in translational repression or destabilization of the target RNA. The translation and decay of mRNAs are closely linked, competing processes, and whether the miRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) acts primarily to reduce translation or stability of the mRNA remains controversial. miR-122 is an abundant, liver-specific miRNA that is an unusual host factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of liver disease in humans. Prior studies show that it binds the 5' UTR of the messenger-sense HCV RNA genome, stimulating translation and promoting genome replication by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that miR-122 binds HCV RNA in association with Ago2 and that this slows decay of the viral genome in infected cells. The stabilizing action of miR-122 does not require the viral RNA to be translationally active nor engaged in replication, and can be functionally substituted by a nonmethylated 5' cap. Our data demonstrate that a RISC-like complex mediates the stability of HCV RNA and suggest that Ago2 and miR-122 act coordinately to protect the viral genome from 5' exonuclease activity of the host mRNA decay machinery. miR-122 thus acts in an unconventional fashion to stabilize HCV RNA and slow its decay, expanding the repertoire of mechanisms by which miRNAs modulate gene expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bakstein, Eduard</author><author>Mladá, Karolína</author><author>Fárková, Eva</author><author>Kolenič, Marian</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Manková, Denisa</author><author>Korčáková, Jana</author><author>Winkler, Petr</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cross-sectional and within-subject seasonality and regularity of  hospitalizations: A population study in mood disorders and schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>Bipolar disorders</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bipolar disorders</full-title></periodical><pages>508-516</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bipolar Disorder</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mood Disorders</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Seasons</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31883178</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/bdi.12884</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Seasonal peaks in hospitalizations for mood disorders and  schizophrenia are well recognized and often replicated. The within-subject tendency to experience illness episodes in the same season, that is, seasonal course, is much less established, as certain individuals may temporarily meet criteria for seasonal course purely by chance. AIMS: In this population, prospective cohort study, we investigated whether between and within-subject seasonal patterns of hospitalizations occurred more frequently than would be expected by chance. METHODS: Using a compulsory, standardized national register of hospitalizations, we analyzed all admissions for mood disorders and schizophrenia in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2013. We used bootstrap tests to compare the observed numbers of (a) participants with seasonal/regular course and (b) hospitalizations in individual months against empirical distributions obtained by simulations. RESULTS: Among 87 184 participants, we found uneven distribution of hospitalizations, with hospitalization peaks for depression in April and November (X(2) (11) = 363.66, P &lt; .001), for mania in August (X(2) (11) = 50.36, P &lt; .001) and for schizophrenia in June (X(2) (11) = 70.34, P &lt; .001). Significantly more participants than would be expected by chance, had two subsequent rehospitalizations in the same 90 days in different years (7.36%, bootstrap P &lt; .01) or after a regular, but non-seasonal interval (6.07%, bootstrap P &lt; .001). The proportion of participants with two consecutive hospitalizations in the same season was below chance level (7.06%). CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric hospitalizations were unevenly distributed throughout the year (cross-sectional seasonality), with evidence for regularity, but not seasonality of hospitalizations within subjects. Our data do not support the validity of seasonal pattern specifier. Season may be a general risk factor, which increases the risk of hospitalizations across psychiatric participants.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wong, Ting Yat</author><author>Radua, Joaquim</author><author>Pomarol-Clotet, Edith</author><author>Salvador, Raymond</author><author>Albajes-Eizagirre, Anton</author><author>Solanes, Aleix</author><author>Canales-Rodriguez, Erick J</author><author>Guerrero-Pedraza, Amalia</author><author>Sarro, Salvador</author><author>Kircher, Tilo</author><author>Nenadic, Igor</author><author>Krug, Axel</author><author>Grotegerd, Dominik</author><author>Dannlowski, Udo</author><author>Borgwardt, Stefan</author><author>Riecher-Rössler, Anita</author><author>Schmidt, Andre</author><author>Andreou, Christina</author><author>Huber, Christian G</author><author>Turner, Jessica</author><author>Calhoun, Vince</author><author>Jiang, Wenhao</author><author>Clark, Sarah</author><author>Walton, Esther</author><author>Spalletta, Gianfranco</author><author>Banaj, Nerisa</author><author>Piras, Fabrizio</author><author>Ciullo, Valentina</author><author>Vecchio, Daniela</author><author>Lebedeva, Irina</author><author>Tomyshev, Alexander S</author><author>Kaleda, Vasily</author><author>Klushnik, Tatyana</author><author>Filho, Geraldo Busatto</author><author>Zanetti, Marcus Vinicius</author><author>Serpa, Mauricio Henriques</author><author>Penteado Rosa, Pedro Gomes</author><author>Hashimoto, Ryota</author><author>Fukunaga, Masaki</author><author>Richter, Anja</author><author>Krämer, Bernd</author><author>Gruber, Oliver</author><author>Voineskos, Aristotle N</author><author>Dickie, Erin W</author><author>Tomecek, David</author><author>Skoch, Antonin</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Hoschl, Cyril</author><author>Bertolino, Alessandro</author><author>Bonvino, Aurora</author><author>Di Giorgio, Annabella</author><author>Holleran, Laurena</author><author>Ciufolini, Simone</author><author>Marques, Tiago Reis</author><author>Dazzan, Paola</author><author>Murray, Robin</author><author>Lamsma, Jelle</author><author>Cahn, Wiepke</author><author>van Haren, Neeltje</author><author>Díaz-Zuluaga, Ana M</author><author>Pineda-Zapata, Julián A</author><author>Vargas, Cristian</author><author>López-Jaramillo, Carlos</author><author>van Erp, Theo G M</author><author>Gur, Ruben C</author><author>Nickl-Jockschat, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An overlapping pattern of cerebral cortical thinning is associated with both  positive symptoms and aggression in schizophrenia via the ENIGMA consortium.</title><secondary-title>Psychological medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychological medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2034-2045</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aggression</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortical Thinning</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Neuroimaging</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31615588</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0033291719002149</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Positive symptoms are a useful predictor of aggression in  schizophrenia. Although a similar pattern of abnormal brain structures related to both positive symptoms and aggression has been reported, this observation has not yet been confirmed in a single sample. METHOD: To study the association between positive symptoms and aggression in schizophrenia on a neurobiological level, a prospective meta-analytic approach was employed to analyze harmonized structural neuroimaging data from 10 research centers worldwide. We analyzed brain MRI scans from 902 individuals with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia and 952 healthy controls. RESULTS: The result identified a widespread cortical thickness reduction in schizophrenia compared to their controls. Two separate meta-regression analyses revealed that a common pattern of reduced cortical gray matter thickness within the left lateral temporal lobe and right midcingulate cortex was significantly associated with both positive symptoms and aggression. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that positive symptoms such as formal thought disorder and auditory misperception, combined with cognitive impairments reflecting difficulties in deploying an adaptive control toward perceived threats, could escalate the likelihood of aggression in schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McWhinney, Sean</author><author>Kolenic, Marian</author><author>Franke, Katja</author><author>Fialova, Marketa</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Matejka, Martin</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Obesity as a Risk Factor for Accelerated Brain Ageing in First-Episode  Psychosis-A Longitudinal Study.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>1772-1781</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aging, Premature</keyword><keyword>Body Mass Index</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34080013</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/schbul/sbab064</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Obesity is highly prevalent in schizophrenia, with implications for  psychiatric prognosis, possibly through links between obesity and brain structure. In this longitudinal study in first episode of psychosis (FEP), we used machine learning and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the impact of psychotic illness and obesity on brain ageing/neuroprogression shortly after illness onset. METHODS: We acquired 2 prospective MRI scans on average 1.61 years apart in 183 FEP and 155 control individuals. We used a machine learning model trained on an independent sample of 504 controls to estimate the individual brain ages of study participants and calculated BrainAGE by subtracting chronological from the estimated brain age. RESULTS: Individuals with FEP had a higher initial BrainAGE than controls (3.39 ± 6.36 vs 1.72 ± 5.56 years; β = 1.68, t(336) = 2.59, P = .01), but similar annual rates of brain ageing over time (1.28 ± 2.40 vs 1.07±1.74 estimated years/actual year; t(333) = 0.93, P = .18). Across both cohorts, greater baseline body mass index (BMI) predicted faster brain ageing (β = 0.08, t(333) = 2.59, P = .01). For each additional BMI point, the brain aged by an additional month per year. Worsening of functioning over time (Global Assessment of Functioning; β = -0.04, t(164) = -2.48, P = .01) and increases especially in negative symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (β = 0.11, t(175) = 3.11, P = .002) were associated with faster brain ageing in FEP. CONCLUSIONS: Brain alterations in psychosis are manifest already during the first episode and over time get worse in those with worsening clinical outcomes or higher baseline BMI. As baseline BMI predicted faster brain ageing, obesity may represent a modifiable risk factor in FEP that is linked with psychiatric outcomes via effects on brain structure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mikolas, Pavol</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author><author>Skoch, Antonin</author><author>Pitra, Zbynek</author><author>Frodl, Thomas</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning classification of first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders  and controls using whole brain white matter fractional anisotropy.</title><secondary-title>BMC psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>97</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Anisotropy</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Diffusion Tensor Imaging</keyword><keyword>Early Diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Support Vector Machine</keyword><keyword>White Matter</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29636016</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12888-018-1678-y</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of schizophrenia could improve the outcome of the  illness. Unlike classical between-group comparisons, machine learning can identify subtle disease patterns on a single subject level, which could help realize the potential of MRI in establishing a psychiatric diagnosis. Machine learning has previously been predominantly tested on gray-matter structural or functional MRI data. In this paper we used a machine learning classifier to differentiate patients with a first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (FES) from healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: We applied linear support-vector machine (SVM) and traditional tract based spatial statistics between group analyses to brain fractional anisotropy (FA) data from 77 FES and 77 age and sex matched healthy controls. We also evaluated the effects of medication and symptoms on the SVM classification. RESULTS: The SVM distinguished between patients and controls with significant accuracy of 62.34% (p = 0.005). Participants with FES showed widespread FA reductions relative to controls in a large cluster (N  = 56,647 voxels, corrected p = 0.002). The white matter regions, which contributed to the correct identification of participants with FES, overlapped with the regions, which showed lower FA in patients relative to controls. There was no association between the classification performance and medication or symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a proof of concept that SVM might help differentiate FES patients early in the course of illness from healthy controls using white-matter fractional anisotropy. As there was no effect of medications or symptoms, the SVM classification seemed to be based on trait rather than state markers and appeared to capture the lower FA in FES participants relative to controls.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez, Mabel</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Konradova, Lucie</author><author>Sedlakova, Katerina</author><author>Dvorska, Karolina</author><author>Prajsova, Jitka</author><author>Kratochvilova, Zuzana</author><author>Levcik, David</author><author>Vlcek, Kamil</author><author>Fajnerova, Iveta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of Visuospatial and Verbal Abilities in First Psychotic Episode of  Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder: Impact on Global Functioning and Quality of Life.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>322</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26733828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00322</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Deficit in visuospatial functions can influence both simple and  complex daily life activities. Despite the fact that visuospatial deficit was reported in schizophrenia, research on visuospatial functions as an independent entity is limited. Our study aims to elucidate the impact of visuospatial deficit in comparison with verbal deficit on global functioning and quality of life in the first psychotic episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (FES). The significance of clinical symptoms and antipsychotic medication was also studied. METHODS: Thirty-six FES patients and a matched group of healthy controls (HC group) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery focused on visuospatial (VIS) and verbal (VERB) functions. Using multiple regression analysis, we evaluated the cumulative effect of VERB and VIS functions, psychiatric symptoms (PANSS) and antipsychotic medication on global functioning (GAF) and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) in the FES group. RESULTS: The FES group demonstrated significant impairment both in VIS and VERB cognitive abilities compared to the HC group. Antipsychotic medication did not significantly affect either VIS or VERB functioning. PANSS was not related to cognitive functioning, apart from the Trail Making Test B. In the FES group, the GAF score was significantly affected by the severity of positive symptoms and VERB functioning, explaining together 60% of GAF variability. The severity of negative and positive symptoms affected only the Physical health domain of WHOQOL-BREF. The degree of VERB deficit was associated with both Physical and Psychological health. Although we did not find any relation between VIS functioning, GAF, and WHOQOL-BREF, a paradoxical finding emerged in the Environment quality domain, where a worse quality of the environment was associated with better VIS functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the deficit in VIS functions is an integral part of cognitive deficit in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, rather than a side effect of symptomatology or antipsychotic medication. Moreover, VERB functioning was a better predictor of GAF and WHOQOL-BREF than VIS functioning. Given the findings of negative or missing effect of VIS deficit on WHOQOL-BREF and GAF, the accuracy of these measures in evaluating the impact of global cognitive deficit on everyday life in schizophrenia could be questioned.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melichárková, Andrea</author><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Marhold, Karol</author><author>Hurdu, Bogdan-Iuliu</author><author>Drescher, Anton</author><author>Zozomová-Lihová, Judita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diversification and independent polyploid origins in the disjunct species Alyssum  repens from the Southeastern Alps and the Carpathians.</title><secondary-title>American journal of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>1499-1518</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis</keyword><keyword>Diploidy</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Phylogeography</keyword><keyword>Polyploidy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31639199</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ajb2.1370</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PREMISE: Disjunct distributions have been commonly observed in mountain plant  species and have stimulated phylogeographic and phylogenetic research. Here we studied Alyssum repens, a member of the polyploid species complex A. montanum-A. repens, which exhibits SE Alpine-Carpathian disjunctions with a large elevational span and consists of diploid and tetraploid populations. We aimed to investigate the species' genetic and cytotype structure in the context of its distribution patterns, to elucidate the polyploid origins and to propose an appropriate taxonomic treatment. METHODS: We combined AFLP fingerprinting markers, sequence variation of the highly repetitive ITS region of rDNA and the low-copy DET1 nuclear gene, genome size, and morphometric data. RESULTS: We identified four geographically structured genetic lineages. One consisted of diploid populations from the foothills of the Southeastern Alps and neighboring regions, and the three others were allopatric montane to alpine groups comprising diploids and tetraploids growing in the Southeastern Carpathians and the Apuseni Mts. in Romania. CONCLUSIONS: We inferred a vicariance scenario associated with Quaternary climatic oscillations, accompanied by one auto- and two allopolyploidization events most likely involving a northern Balkan relative. Whereas genetic differentiation and allopatric distribution would favor the taxonomic splitting of this species, the genetic lineages largely lack morphological distinguishability, and their ecological, cytotype and genome size divergence is only partial. Even though we probably face here a case of incipient speciation, we propose to maintain the current taxonomic treatment of Alyssum repens as a single, albeit variable, species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Pierrefeu, A</author><author>Löfstedt, T</author><author>Laidi, C</author><author>Hadj-Selem, F</author><author>Bourgin, J</author><author>Hajek, T</author><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Kolenic, M</author><author>Ciuciu, P</author><author>Hamdani, N</author><author>Leboyer, M</author><author>Fovet, T</author><author>Jardri, R</author><author>Houenou, J</author><author>Duchesnay, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying a neuroanatomical signature of schizophrenia, reproducible across  sites and stages, using machine learning with structured sparsity.</title><secondary-title>Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>571-580</pages><volume>138</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gray Matter</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30242828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/acps.12964</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: Structural MRI (sMRI) increasingly offers insight into abnormalities  inherent to schizophrenia. Previous machine learning applications suggest that individual classification is feasible and reliable and, however, is focused on the predictive performance of the clinical status in cross-sectional designs, which has limited biological perspectives. Moreover, most studies depend on relatively small cohorts or single recruiting site. Finally, no study controlled for disease stage or medication's effect. These elements cast doubt on previous findings' reproducibility. METHOD: We propose a machine learning algorithm that provides an interpretable brain signature. Using large datasets collected from 4 sites (276 schizophrenia patients, 330 controls), we assessed cross-site prediction reproducibility and associated predictive signature. For the first time, we evaluated the predictive signature regarding medication and illness duration using an independent dataset of first-episode patients. RESULTS: Machine learning classifiers based on neuroanatomical features yield significant intersite prediction accuracies (72%) together with an excellent predictive signature stability. This signature provides a neural score significantly correlated with symptom severity and the extent of cognitive impairments. Moreover, this signature demonstrates its efficiency on first-episode psychosis patients (73% accuracy). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the existence of a common neuroanatomical signature for schizophrenia, shared by a majority of patients even from an early stage of the disorder.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolenic, Marian</author><author>Franke, Katja</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author><author>Matejka, Martin</author><author>Capkova, Jana</author><author>Pausova, Zdenka</author><author>Uher, Rudolf</author><author>Alda, Martin</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Obesity, dyslipidemia and brain age in first-episode psychosis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of psychiatric research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of psychiatric research</full-title></periodical><pages>151-158</pages><volume>99</volume><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Dyslipidemias</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Overweight</keyword><keyword>Pattern Recognition, Automated</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29454222</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.02.012</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Obesity and dyslipidemia may negatively affect brain health and are  frequent medical comorbidities of schizophrenia and related disorders. Despite the high burden of metabolic disorders, little is known about their effects on brain structure in psychosis. We investigated, whether obesity or dyslipidemia contributed to brain alterations in first-episode psychosis (FEP). METHODS: 120 participants with FEP, who were undergoing their first psychiatric hospitalization, had &lt;24 months of untreated psychosis and were 18-35 years old and 114 controls within the same age range participated in the study. We acquired 3T brain structural MRI, fasting lipids and body mass index. We used machine learning trained on an independent sample of 504 controls to estimate the individual brain age of study participants and calculated the BrainAGE score by subtracting the chronological from the estimated brain age. RESULTS: In a multiple regression model, the diagnosis of FEP (B = 1.15, SE B = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001) and obesity/overweight (B = 0.92, SE B = 0.35, p = 0.008) were each additively associated with BrainAGE scores (R(2) = 0.22, F(3, 230) = 21.92, p &lt; 0.001). BrainAGE scores were highest in participants with FEP and obesity/overweight (3.83 years, 95%CI = 2.35-5.31) and lowest in normal weight controls (-0.27 years, 95%CI = -1.22-0.69). LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol or triglycerides were not associated with BrainAGE scores. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obesity may be an independent risk factor for diffuse brain alterations manifesting as advanced brain age already early in the course of psychosis. These findings raise the possibility that targeting metabolic health and intervening already at the level of overweight/obesity could slow brain ageing in FEP.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Škoch, Antonín</author><author>Rehák Bučková, Barbora</author><author>Mareš, Jan</author><author>Tintěra, Jaroslav</author><author>Sanda, Pavel</author><author>Jajcay, Lucia</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human brain structural connectivity matrices-ready for modelling.</title><secondary-title>Scientific data</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific data</full-title></periodical><pages>486</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Connectome</keyword><keyword>Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Diffusion Tensor Imaging</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>White Matter</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35945231</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41597-022-01596-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The human brain represents a complex computational system, the function and  structure of which may be measured using various neuroimaging techniques focusing on separate properties of the brain tissue and activity. We capture the organization of white matter fibers acquired by diffusion-weighted imaging using probabilistic diffusion tractography. By segmenting the results of tractography into larger anatomical units, it is possible to draw inferences about the structural relationships between these parts of the system. This pipeline results in a structural connectivity matrix, which contains an estimate of connection strength among all regions. However, raw data processing is complex, computationally intensive, and requires expert quality control, which may be discouraging for researchers with less experience in the field. We thus provide brain structural connectivity matrices in a form ready for modelling and analysis and thus usable by a wide community of scientists. The presented dataset contains brain structural connectivity matrices together with the underlying raw diffusion and structural data, as well as basic demographic data of 88 healthy subjects.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pigoni, A</author><author>Dwyer, D</author><author>Squarcina, L</author><author>Borgwardt, S</author><author>Crespo-Facorro, B</author><author>Dazzan, P</author><author>Smesny, S</author><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Spalletta, G</author><author>Sanfelici, R</author><author>Antonucci, L A</author><author>Reuf, A</author><author>Oeztuerk, Oe F</author><author>Schmidt, A</author><author>Ciufolini, S</author><author>Schönborn-Harrisberger, F</author><author>Langbein, K</author><author>Gussew, A</author><author>Reichenbach, J R</author><author>Zaytseva, Y</author><author>Piras, F</author><author>Delvecchio, G</author><author>Bellani, M</author><author>Ruggeri, M</author><author>Lasalvia, A</author><author>Tordesillas-Gutiérrez, D</author><author>Ortiz, V</author><author>Murray, R M</author><author>Reis-Marques, T</author><author>Di Forti, M</author><author>Koutsouleris, N</author><author>Brambilla, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classification of first-episode psychosis using cortical thickness: A large  multicenter MRI study.</title><secondary-title>European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of  Neuropsychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of  Neuropsychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>34-47</pages><volume>47</volume><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Neuroimaging</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Support Vector Machine</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33957410</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.04.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Machine learning classifications of first-episode psychosis (FEP) using  neuroimaging have predominantly analyzed brain volumes. Some studies examined cortical thickness, but most of them have used parcellation approaches with data from single sites, which limits claims of generalizability. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale, multi-site analysis of cortical thickness comparing parcellations and vertex-wise approaches. By leveraging the multi-site nature of the study, we further investigated how different demographical and site-dependent variables affected predictions. Finally, we assessed relationships between predictions and clinical variables. 428 subjects (147 females, mean age 27.14) with FEP and 448 (230 females, mean age 27.06) healthy controls were enrolled in 8 centers by the ClassiFEP group. All subjects underwent a structural MRI and were clinically assessed. Cortical thickness parcellation (68 areas) and full cortical maps (20,484 vertices) were extracted. Linear Support Vector Machine was used for classification within a repeated nested cross-validation framework. Vertex-wise thickness maps outperformed parcellation-based methods with a balanced accuracy of 66.2% and an Area Under the Curve of 72%. By stratifying our sample for MRI scanner, we increased generalizability across sites. Temporal brain areas resulted as the most influential in the classification. The predictive decision scores significantly correlated with age at onset, duration of treatment, and positive symptoms. In conclusion, although far from the threshold of clinical relevance, temporal cortical thickness proved to classify between FEP subjects and healthy individuals. The assessment of site-dependent variables permitted an increase in the across-site generalizability, thus attempting to address an important machine learning limitation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laidi, C</author><author>Hajek, T</author><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Kolenic, M</author><author>d'Albis, M-A</author><author>Sarrazin, S</author><author>Mangin, J-F</author><author>Duchesnay, E</author><author>Brambilla, P</author><author>Wessa, M</author><author>Linke, J</author><author>Polosan, M</author><author>Favre, P</author><author>Versace, A L</author><author>Phillips, M L</author><author>Manjon, J V</author><author>Romero, J E</author><author>Hozer, F</author><author>Leboyer, M</author><author>Coupe, P</author><author>Houenou, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cerebellar parcellation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</title><secondary-title>Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>468-476</pages><volume>140</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Antimanic Agents</keyword><keyword>Bipolar Disorder</keyword><keyword>Cerebellar Cortex</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lithium Compounds</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31418816</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/acps.13087</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The cerebellum is involved in cognitive processing and emotion  control. Cerebellar alterations could explain symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, literature suggests that lithium might influence cerebellar anatomy. Our aim was to study cerebellar anatomy in SZ and BD, and investigate the effect of lithium. METHODS: Participants from 7 centers worldwide underwent a 3T MRI. We included 182 patients with SZ, 144 patients with BD, and 322 controls. We automatically segmented the cerebellum using the CERES pipeline. All outputs were visually inspected. RESULTS: Patients with SZ showed a smaller global cerebellar gray matter volume compared to controls, with most of the changes located to the cognitive part of the cerebellum (Crus II and lobule VIIb). This decrease was present in the subgroup of patients with recent-onset SZ. We did not find any alterations in the cerebellum in patients with BD. However, patients medicated with lithium had a larger size of the anterior cerebellum, compared to patients not treated with lithium. CONCLUSION: Our multicenter study supports a distinct pattern of cerebellar alterations in SZ and BD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McWhinney, Sean R</author><author>Brosch, Katharina</author><author>Calhoun, Vince D</author><author>Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto</author><author>Crossley, Nicolas A</author><author>Dannlowski, Udo</author><author>Dickie, Erin</author><author>Dietze, Lorielle M F</author><author>Donohoe, Gary</author><author>Du Plessis, Stefan</author><author>Ehrlich, Stefan</author><author>Emsley, Robin</author><author>Furstova, Petra</author><author>Glahn, David C</author><author>Gonzalez-Valderrama, Alfonso</author><author>Grotegerd, Dominik</author><author>Holleran, Laurena</author><author>Kircher, Tilo T J</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Kolenic, Marian</author><author>Lencer, Rebekka</author><author>Nenadić, Igor</author><author>Opel, Nils</author><author>Pfarr, Julia-Katharina</author><author>Rodrigue, Amanda L</author><author>Rootes-Murdy, Kelly</author><author>Ross, Alex J</author><author>Sim, Kang</author><author>Škoch, Antonín</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Stein, Frederike</author><author>Švancer, Patrik</author><author>Tordesillas-Gutiérrez, Diana</author><author>Undurraga, Juan</author><author>Vázquez-Bourgon, Javier</author><author>Voineskos, Aristotle</author><author>Walton, Esther</author><author>Weickert, Thomas W</author><author>Weickert, Cynthia Shannon</author><author>Thompson, Paul M</author><author>van Erp, Theo G M</author><author>Turner, Jessica A</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correction: Obesity and brain structure in schizophrenia -

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the factor structure of the PANSS and develop such a staging method. METHODS: Twenty-nine centers from 25 countries contributed 2358 patients aged 37.21 ± 11.87 years with schizophrenia. Analysis of covariance, Exploratory Factor Analysis, Discriminant Function Analysis, and inspection of resultant plots were performed. RESULTS: Exploratory Factor Analysis returned 5 factors explaining 59% of the variance (positive, negative, excitement/hostility, depression/anxiety, and neurocognition). The staging model included 4 main stages with substages that were predominantly characterized by a single domain of symptoms (stage 1: positive; stages 2a and 2b: excitement/hostility; stage 3a and 3b: depression/anxiety; stage 4a and 4b: neurocognition). There were no differences between sexes. The Discriminant Function Analysis developed an algorithm that correctly classified &gt;85% of patients. DISCUSSION: This study elaborates a 5-factor solution and a clinical staging method for patients with schizophrenia. It is the largest study to address these issues among patients who are more likely to remain affiliated with mental health services for prolonged periods of time.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N</author><author>Dragioti, Elena</author><author>Theofilidis, Antonis T</author><author>Wiklund, Tobias</author><author>Atmatzidis, Xenofon</author><author>Nimatoudis, Ioannis</author><author>Thys, Erik</author><author>Wampers, Martien</author><author>Hranov, Luchezar</author><author>Hristova, Trayana</author><author>Aptalidis, Daniil</author><author>Milev, Roumen</author><author>Iftene, Felicia</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Furstova, Petra</author><author>From, Tiina</author><author>Karlsson, Henry</author><author>Walta, Maija</author><author>Salokangas, Raimo K R</author><author>Azorin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Bouniard, Justine</author><author>Montant, Julie</author><author>Juckel, Georg</author><author>Haussleiter, Ida S</author><author>Douzenis, Athanasios</author><author>Michopoulos, Ioannis</author><author>Ferentinos, Panagiotis</author><author>Smyrnis, Nikolaos</author><author>Mantonakis, Leonidas</author><author>Nemes, Zsófia</author><author>Gonda, Xenia</author><author>Vajda, Dora</author><author>Juhasz, Anita</author><author>Shrivastava, Amresh</author><author>Waddington, John</author><author>Pompili, Maurizio</author><author>Comparelli, Anna</author><author>Corigliano, Valentina</author><author>Rancans, Elmars</author><author>Navickas, Alvydas</author><author>Hilbig, Jan</author><author>Bukelskis, Laurynas</author><author>Stevovic, Lidija I</author><author>Vodopic, Sanja</author><author>Esan, Oluyomi</author><author>Oladele, Oluremi</author><author>Osunbote, Christopher</author><author>Rybakowski, Janusz K</author><author>Wojciak, Pawel</author><author>Domowicz, Klaudia</author><author>Figueira, Maria L</author><author>Linhares, Ludgero</author><author>Crawford, Joana</author><author>Panfil, Anca-Livia</author><author>Smirnova, Daria</author><author>Izmailova, Olga</author><author>Lecic-Tosevski, Dusica</author><author>Temmingh, Henk</author><author>Howells, Fleur</author><author>Bobes, Julio</author><author>Garcia-Portilla, Maria P</author><author>García-Alvarez, Leticia</author><author>Erzin, Gamze</author><author>Karadağ, Hasan</author><author>De Sousa, Avinash</author><author>Bendre, Anuja</author><author>Hoschl, Cyril</author><author>Bredicean, Cristina</author><author>Papava, Ion</author><author>Vukovic, Olivera</author><author>Pejuskovic, Bojana</author><author>Russell, Vincent</author><author>Athanasiadis, Loukas</author><author>Konsta, Anastasia</author><author>Stein, Dan</author><author>Berk, Michael</author><author>Dean, Olivia</author><author>Tandon, Rajiv</author><author>Kasper, Siegfried</author><author>De Hert, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling psychological function in patients with schizophrenia with the PANSS: an  international multi-center study.</title><secondary-title>CNS spectrums</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CNS spectrums</full-title></periodical><pages>290-298</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32290897</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S1092852920001091</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to explore the changing  interrelationships among clinical variables through the stages of schizophrenia in order to assemble a comprehensive and meaningful disease model. METHODS: Twenty-nine centers from 25 countries participated and included 2358 patients aged 37.21 ± 11.87 years with schizophrenia. Multiple linear regression analysis and visual inspection of plots were performed. RESULTS: The results suggest that with progression stages, there are changing correlations among Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors at each stage and each factor correlates with all the others in that particular stage, in which this factor is dominant. This internal structure further supports the validity of an already proposed four stages model, with positive symptoms dominating the first stage, excitement/hostility the second, depression the third, and neurocognitive decline the last stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current study investigated the mental organization and functioning in patients with schizophrenia in relation to different stages of illness progression. It revealed two distinct &quot;cores&quot; of schizophrenia, the &quot;Positive&quot; and the &quot;Negative,&quot; while neurocognitive decline escalates during the later stages. Future research should focus on the therapeutic implications of such a model. Stopping the progress of the illness could demand to stop the succession of stages. This could be achieved not only by both halting the triggering effect of positive and negative symptoms, but also by stopping the sensitization effect on the neural pathways responsible for the development of hostility, excitement, anxiety, and depression as well as the deleterious effect on neural networks responsible for neurocognition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N</author><author>Dragioti, Elena</author><author>Theofilidis, Antonis T</author><author>Wiklund, Tobias</author><author>Atmatzidis, Xenofon</author><author>Nimatoudis, Ioannis</author><author>Thys, Erik</author><author>Wampers, Martien</author><author>Hranov, Luchezar</author><author>Hristova, Trayana</author><author>Aptalidis, Daniil</author><author>Milev, Roumen</author><author>Iftene, Felicia</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Furstova, Petra</author><author>From, Tiina</author><author>Karlsson, Henry</author><author>Walta, Maija</author><author>Salokangas, Raimo K R</author><author>Azorin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Bouniard, Justine</author><author>Montant, Julie</author><author>Juckel, Georg</author><author>Haussleiter, Ida S</author><author>Douzenis, Athanasios</author><author>Michopoulos, Ioannis</author><author>Ferentinos, Panagiotis</author><author>Smyrnis, Nikolaos</author><author>Mantonakis, Leonidas</author><author>Nemes, Zsófia</author><author>Gonda, Xenia</author><author>Vajda, Dora</author><author>Juhasz, Anita</author><author>Shrivastava, Amresh</author><author>Waddington, John</author><author>Pompili, Maurizio</author><author>Comparelli, Anna</author><author>Corigliano, Valentina</author><author>Rancans, Elmars</author><author>Navickas, Alvydas</author><author>Hilbig, Jan</author><author>Bukelskis, Laurynas</author><author>Stevovic, Lidija I</author><author>Vodopic, Sanja</author><author>Esan, Oluyomi</author><author>Oladele, Oluremi</author><author>Osunbote, Christopher</author><author>Rybakowski, Janusz K</author><author>Wojciak, Pawel</author><author>Domowicz, Klaudia</author><author>Figueira, Maria L</author><author>Linhares, Ludgero</author><author>Crawford, Joana</author><author>Panfil, Anca-Livia</author><author>Smirnova, Daria</author><author>Izmailova, Olga</author><author>Lecic-Tosevski, Dusica</author><author>Temmingh, Henk</author><author>Howells, Fleur</author><author>Bobes, Julio</author><author>Garcia-Portilla, Maria P</author><author>García-Alvarez, Leticia</author><author>Erzin, Gamze</author><author>Karadağ, Hasan</author><author>De Sousa, Avinash</author><author>Bendre, Anuja</author><author>Hoschl, Cyril</author><author>Bredicean, Cristina</author><author>Papava, Ion</author><author>Vukovic, Olivera</author><author>Pejuskovic, Bojana</author><author>Russell, Vincent</author><author>Athanasiadis, Loukas</author><author>Konsta, Anastasia</author><author>Fountoulakis, Nikolaos K</author><author>Stein, Dan</author><author>Berk, Michael</author><author>Dean, Olivia</author><author>Tandon, Rajiv</author><author>Kasper, Siegfried</author><author>De Hert, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gender, age at onset, and duration of being ill as predictors for the long-term  course and outcome of schizophrenia: an international multicenter study.</title><secondary-title>CNS spectrums</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CNS spectrums</full-title></periodical><pages>716-723</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age of Onset</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34369340</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S1092852921000742</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to explore the effect of gender, age  at onset, and duration on the long-term course of schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-nine centers from 25 countries representing all continents participated in the study that included 2358 patients aged 37.21 ± 11.87 years with a DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia; the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale as well as relevant clinicodemographic data were gathered. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were used, and the methodology corrected for the presence of potentially confounding effects. RESULTS: There was a 3-year later age at onset for females (P &lt; .001) and lower rates of negative symptoms (P &lt; .01) and higher depression/anxiety measures (P &lt; .05) at some stages. The age at onset manifested a distribution with a single peak for both genders with a tendency of patients with younger onset having slower advancement through illness stages (P = .001). No significant effects were found concerning duration of illness. DISCUSSION: Our results confirmed a later onset and a possibly more benign course and outcome in females. Age at onset manifested a single peak in both genders, and surprisingly, earlier onset was related to a slower progression of the illness. No effect of duration has been detected. These results are partially in accord with the literature, but they also differ as a consequence of the different starting point of our methodology (a novel staging model), which in our opinion precluded the impact of confounding effects. Future research should focus on the therapeutic policy and implications of these results in more representative samples.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McWhinney, Sean R</author><author>Brosch, Katharina</author><author>Calhoun, Vince D</author><author>Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto</author><author>Crossley, Nicolas A</author><author>Dannlowski, Udo</author><author>Dickie, Erin</author><author>Dietze, Lorielle M F</author><author>Donohoe, Gary</author><author>Du Plessis, Stefan</author><author>Ehrlich, Stefan</author><author>Emsley, Robin</author><author>Furstova, Petra</author><author>Glahn, David C</author><author>Gonzalez-Valderrama, Alfonso</author><author>Grotegerd, Dominik</author><author>Holleran, Laurena</author><author>Kircher, Tilo T J</author><author>Knytl, Pavel</author><author>Kolenic, Marian</author><author>Lencer, Rebekka</author><author>Nenadić, Igor</author><author>Opel, Nils</author><author>Pfarr, Julia-Katharina</author><author>Rodrigue, Amanda L</author><author>Rootes-Murdy, Kelly</author><author>Ross, Alex J</author><author>Sim, Kang</author><author>Škoch, Antonín</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Stein, Frederike</author><author>Švancer, Patrik</author><author>Tordesillas-Gutiérrez, Diana</author><author>Undurraga, Juan</author><author>Vázquez-Bourgon, Javier</author><author>Voineskos, Aristotle</author><author>Walton, Esther</author><author>Weickert, Thomas W</author><author>Weickert, Cynthia Shannon</author><author>Thompson, Paul M</author><author>van Erp, Theo G M</author><author>Turner, Jessica A</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Obesity and brain structure in schizophrenia - ENIGMA study in 3021 individuals.</title><secondary-title>Molecular psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>3731-3737</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Depressive Disorder, Major</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35739320</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41380-022-01616-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Schizophrenia is frequently associated with obesity, which is linked with  neurostructural alterations. Yet, we do not understand how the brain correlates of obesity map onto the brain changes in schizophrenia. We obtained MRI-derived brain cortical and subcortical measures and body mass index (BMI) from 1260 individuals with schizophrenia and 1761 controls from 12 independent research sites within the ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group. We jointly modeled the statistical effects of schizophrenia and BMI using mixed effects. BMI was additively associated with structure of many of the same brain regions as schizophrenia, but the cortical and subcortical alterations in schizophrenia were more widespread and pronounced. Both BMI and schizophrenia were primarily associated with changes in cortical thickness, with fewer correlates in surface area. While, BMI was negatively associated with cortical thickness, the significant associations between BMI and surface area or subcortical volumes were positive. Lastly, the brain correlates of obesity were replicated among large studies and closely resembled neurostructural changes in major depressive disorders. We confirmed widespread associations between BMI and brain structure in individuals with schizophrenia. People with both obesity and schizophrenia showed more pronounced brain alterations than people with only one of these conditions. Obesity appears to be a relevant factor which could account for heterogeneity of brain imaging findings and for differences in brain imaging outcomes among people with schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smart, Sophie E</author><author>Agbedjro, Deborah</author><author>Pardiñas, Antonio F</author><author>Ajnakina, Olesya</author><author>Alameda, Luis</author><author>Andreassen, Ole A</author><author>Barnes, Thomas R E</author><author>Berardi, Domenico</author><author>Camporesi, Sara</author><author>Cleusix, Martine</author><author>Conus, Philippe</author><author>Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto</author><author>D'Andrea, Giuseppe</author><author>Demjaha, Arsime</author><author>Di Forti, Marta</author><author>Do, Kim</author><author>Doody, Gillian</author><author>Eap, Chin B</author><author>Ferchiou, Aziz</author><author>Guidi, Lorenzo</author><author>Homman, Lina</author><author>Jenni, Raoul</author><author>Joyce, Eileen</author><author>Kassoumeri, Laura</author><author>Lastrina, Ornella</author><author>Melle, Ingrid</author><author>Morgan, Craig</author><author>O'Neill, Francis A</author><author>Pignon, Baptiste</author><author>Restellini, Romeo</author><author>Richard, Jean-Romain</author><author>Simonsen, Carmen</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Szöke, Andrei</author><author>Tarricone, Ilaria</author><author>Tortelli, Andrea</author><author>Üçok, Alp</author><author>Vázquez-Bourgon, Javier</author><author>Murray, Robin M</author><author>Walters, James T R</author><author>Stahl, Daniel</author><author>MacCabe, James H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical predictors of antipsychotic treatment resistance: Development and  internal validation of a prognostic prediction model by the STRATA-G consortium.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia research</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>250</volume><keywords><keyword>Antipsychotic Agents</keyword><keyword>Educational Status</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36242784</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.schres.2022.09.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to, firstly, identify characteristics at first-episode  of psychosis that are associated with later antipsychotic treatment resistance (TR) and, secondly, to develop a parsimonious prediction model for TR. METHODS: We combined data from ten prospective, first-episode psychosis cohorts from across Europe and categorised patients as TR or non-treatment resistant (NTR) after a mean follow up of 4.18 years (s.d. = 3.20) for secondary data analysis. We identified a list of potential predictors from clinical and demographic data recorded at first-episode. These potential predictors were entered in two models: a multivariable logistic regression to identify which were independently associated with TR and a penalised logistic regression, which performed variable selection, to produce a parsimonious prediction model. This model was internally validated using a 5-fold, 50-repeat cross-validation optimism-correction. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of N = 2216 participants of which 385 (17 %) developed TR. Younger age of psychosis onset and fewer years in education were independently associated with increased odds of developing TR. The prediction model selected 7 out of 17 variables that, when combined, could quantify the risk of being TR better than chance. These included age of onset, years in education, gender, BMI, relationship status, alcohol use, and positive symptoms. The optimism-corrected area under the curve was 0.59 (accuracy = 64 %, sensitivity = 48 %, and specificity = 76 %). IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that treatment resistance can be predicted, at first-episode of psychosis. Pending a model update and external validation, we demonstrate the potential value of prediction models for TR.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl"

regional distribution of white matter (WM) abnormalities in schizophrenia  remains poorly understood, and reported disease effects on the brain vary widely between studies. In an effort to identify commonalities across studies, we perform what we believe is the first ever large-scale coordinated study of WM microstructural differences in schizophrenia. Our analysis consisted of 2359 healthy controls and 1963 schizophrenia patients from 29 independent international studies; we harmonized the processing and statistical analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data across sites and meta-analyzed effects across studies. Significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) in schizophrenia patients were widespread, and detected in 20 of 25 regions of interest within a WM skeleton representing all major WM fasciculi. Effect sizes varied by region, peaking at (d=0.42) for the entire WM skeleton, driven more by peripheral areas as opposed to the core WM where regions of interest were defined. The anterior corona radiata (d=0.40) and corpus callosum (d=0.39), specifically its body (d=0.39) and genu (d=0.37), showed greatest effects. Significant decreases, to lesser degrees, were observed in almost all regions analyzed. Larger effect sizes were observed for FA than diffusivity measures; significantly higher mean and radial diffusivity was observed for schizophrenia patients compared with controls. No significant effects of age at onset of schizophrenia or medication dosage were detected. As the largest coordinated analysis of WM differences in a psychiatric disorder to date, the present study provides a robust profile of widespread WM abnormalities in schizophrenia patients worldwide.

We investigated evidence for advanced brain ageing in adult SZ patients, and whether this was associated with clinical characteristics in a prospective meta-analytic study conducted by the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group. The study included data from 26 cohorts worldwide, with a total of 2803 SZ patients (mean age 34.2 years; range 18-72 years; 67% male) and 2598 healthy controls (mean age 33.8 years, range 18-73 years, 55% male). Brain-predicted age was individually estimated using a model trained on independent data based on 68 measures of cortical thickness and surface area, 7 subcortical volumes, lateral ventricular volumes and total intracranial volume, all derived from T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Deviations from a healthy brain ageing trajectory were assessed by the difference between brain-predicted age and chronological age (brain-predicted age difference [brain-PAD]). On average, SZ patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +3.55 years (95% CI: 2.91, 4.19; I(2) = 57.53%) compared to controls, after adjusting for age, sex and site (Cohen's d = 0.48). Among SZ patients, brain-PAD was not associated with specific clinical characteristics (age of onset, duration of illness, symptom severity, or antipsychotic use and dose). This large-scale collaborative study suggests advanced structural brain ageing in SZ. Longitudinal studies of SZ and a range of mental and somatic health outcomes will help to further evaluate the clinical implications of increased brain-PAD and its ability to be influenced by interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type

Morphology of the human cerebral cortex differs across psychiatric  disorders, with neurobiology and developmental origins mostly undetermined. Deviations in the tangential growth of the cerebral cortex during pre/perinatal periods may be reflected in individual variations in cortical surface area later in life. METHODS: Interregional profiles of group differences in surface area between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging from 27,359 individuals including those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and high general psychopathology (through the Child Behavior Checklist). Similarity of interregional profiles of group differences in surface area and prenatal cell-specific gene expression was assessed. RESULTS: Across the 11 cortical regions, group differences in cortical area for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and Child Behavior Checklist were dominant in multimodal association cortices. The same interregional profiles were also associated with interregional profiles of (prenatal) gene expression specific to proliferative cells, namely radial glia and intermediate progenitor cells (greater expression, larger difference), as well as differentiated cells, namely excitatory neurons and endothelial and mural cells (greater expression, smaller difference). Finally, these cell types were implicated in known pre/perinatal risk factors for psychosis. Genes coexpressed with radial glia were enriched with genes implicated in congenital abnormalities, birth weight, hypoxia, and starvation. Genes coexpressed with endothelial and mural genes were enriched with genes associated with maternal hypertension and preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a neurodevelopmental model of vulnerability to mental illness whereby prenatal risk factors acting through cell-specific processes lead to deviations from typical brain development during pregnancy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pardiñas, Antonio F</author><author>Smart, Sophie E</author><author>Willcocks, Isabella R</author><author>Holmans, Peter A</author><author>Dennison, Charlotte A</author><author>Lynham, Amy J</author><author>Legge, Sophie E</author><author>Baune, Bernhard T</author><author>Bigdeli, Tim B</author><author>Cairns, Murray J</author><author>Corvin, Aiden</author><author>Fanous, Ayman H</author><author>Frank, Josef</author><author>Kelly, Brian</author><author>McQuillin, Andrew</author><author>Melle, Ingrid</author><author>Mortensen, Preben B</author><author>Mowry, Bryan J</author><author>Pato, Carlos N</author><author>Periyasamy, Sathish</author><author>Rietschel, Marcella</author><author>Rujescu, Dan</author><author>Simonsen, Carmen</author><author>St Clair, David</author><author>Tooney, Paul</author><author>Wu, Jing Qin</author><author>Andreassen, Ole A</author><author>Kowalec, Kaarina</author><author>Sullivan, Patrick F</author><author>Murray, Robin M</author><author>Owen, Michael J</author><author>MacCabe, James H</author><author>O'Donovan, Michael C</author><author>Walters, James T R</author><author>Ajnakina, Olesya</author><author>Alameda, Luis</author><author>Barnes, Thomas R E</author><author>Berardi, Domenico</author><author>Bonora, Elena</author><author>Camporesi, Sara</author><author>Cleusix, Martine</author><author>Conus, Philippe</author><author>Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto</author><author>D'Andrea, Giuseppe</author><author>Demjaha, Arsime</author><author>Do, Kim Q</author><author>Doody, Gillian A</author><author>Eap, Chin B</author><author>Ferchiou, Aziz</author><author>Di Forti, Marta</author><author>Guidi, Lorenzo</author><author>Homman, Lina</author><author>Jenni, Raoul</author><author>Joyce, Eileen M</author><author>Kassoumeri, Laura</author><author>Khadimallah, Inès</author><author>Lastrina, Ornella</author><author>Muratori, Roberto</author><author>Noyan, Handan</author><author>O'Neill, Francis A</author><author>Pignon, Baptiste</author><author>Restellini, Romeo</author><author>Richard, Jean-Romain</author><author>Schürhoff, Franck</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Szöke, Andrei</author><author>Tarricone, Ilaria</author><author>Tortelli, Andrea</author><author>Üçok, Alp</author><author>Vázquez-Bourgon, Javier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interaction Testing and Polygenic Risk Scoring to Estimate the Association of  Common Genetic Variants With Treatment Resistance in Schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>JAMA psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA psychiatry</full-title></periodical><pages>260-269</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Multifactorial Inheritance</keyword><keyword>Psychotic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35019943</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.3799</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>IMPORTANCE: About 20% to 30% of people with schizophrenia have psychotic symptoms  that do not respond adequately to first-line antipsychotic treatment. This clinical presentation, chronic and highly disabling, is known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The causes of treatment resistance and their relationships with causes underlying schizophrenia are largely unknown. Adequately powered genetic studies of TRS are scarce because of the difficulty in collecting data from well-characterized TRS cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the genetic architecture of TRS through the reassessment of genetic data from schizophrenia studies and its validation in carefully ascertained clinical samples. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two case-control genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia were performed in which the case samples were defined as individuals with TRS (n = 10 501) and individuals with non-TRS (n = 20 325). The differences in effect sizes for allelic associations were then determined between both studies, the reasoning being such differences reflect treatment resistance instead of schizophrenia. Genotype data were retrieved from the CLOZUK and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia studies. The output was validated using polygenic risk score (PRS) profiling of 2 independent schizophrenia cohorts with TRS and non-TRS: a prevalence sample with 817 individuals (Cardiff Cognition in Schizophrenia [CardiffCOGS]) and an incidence sample with 563 individuals (Genetics Workstream of the Schizophrenia Treatment Resistance and Therapeutic Advances [STRATA-G]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: GWAS of treatment resistance in schizophrenia. The results of the GWAS were compared with complex polygenic traits through a genetic correlation approach and were used for PRS analysis on the independent validation cohorts using the same TRS definition. RESULTS: The study included a total of 85 490 participants (48 635 [56.9%] male) in its GWAS stage and 1380 participants (859 [62.2%] male) in its PRS validation stage. Treatment resistance in schizophrenia emerged as a polygenic trait with detectable heritability (1% to 4%), and several traits related to intelligence and cognition were found to be genetically correlated with it (genetic correlation, 0.41-0.69). PRS analysis in the CardiffCOGS prevalence sample showed a positive association between TRS and a history of taking clozapine (r2 = 2.03%; P = .001), which was replicated in the STRATA-G incidence sample (r2 = 1.09%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this GWAS, common genetic variants were differentially associated with TRS, and these associations may have been obscured through the amalgamation of large GWAS samples in previous studies of broadly defined schizophrenia. Findings of this study suggest the validity of meta-analytic approaches for studies on patient outcomes, including treatment resistance.</abstract></record><record><database

asymmetry is an important organizing feature of the healthy brain that  may be altered in schizophrenia, but most studies have used relatively small samples and heterogeneous approaches, resulting in equivocal findings. We carried out the largest case-control study of structural brain asymmetries in schizophrenia, with MRI data from 5,080 affected individuals and 6,015 controls across 46 datasets, using a single image analysis protocol. Asymmetry indexes were calculated for global and regional cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume measures. Differences of asymmetry were calculated between affected individuals and controls per dataset, and effect sizes were meta-analyzed across datasets. Small average case-control differences were observed for thickness asymmetries of the rostral anterior cingulate and the middle temporal gyrus, both driven by thinner left-hemispheric cortices in schizophrenia. Analyses of these asymmetries with respect to the use of antipsychotic medication and other clinical variables did not show any significant associations. Assessment of age- and sex-specific effects revealed a stronger average leftward asymmetry of pallidum volume between older cases and controls. Case-control differences in a multivariate context were assessed in a subset of the data (N = 2,029), which revealed that 7% of the variance across all structural asymmetries was explained by case-control status. Subtle case-control differences of brain macrostructural asymmetry may reflect differences at the molecular, cytoarchitectonic, or circuit levels that have functional relevance for the disorder. Reduced left middle temporal cortical thickness is consistent with altered left-hemisphere language network organization in schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database

The profile of cortical neuroanatomical abnormalities in  schizophrenia is not fully understood, despite hundreds of published structural brain imaging studies. This study presents the first meta-analysis of cortical thickness and surface area abnormalities in schizophrenia conducted by the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Schizophrenia Working Group. METHODS: The study included data from 4474 individuals with schizophrenia (mean age, 32.3 years; range, 11-78 years; 66% male) and 5098 healthy volunteers (mean age, 32.8 years; range, 10-87 years; 53% male) assessed with standardized methods at 39 centers worldwide. RESULTS: Compared with healthy volunteers, individuals with schizophrenia have widespread thinner cortex (left/right hemisphere: Cohen's d = -0.530/-0.516) and smaller surface area (left/right hemisphere: Cohen's d = -0.251/-0.254), with the largest effect sizes for both in frontal and temporal lobe regions. Regional group differences in cortical thickness remained significant when statistically controlling for global cortical thickness, suggesting regional specificity. In contrast, effects for cortical surface area appear global. Case-control, negative, cortical thickness effect sizes were two to three times larger in individuals receiving antipsychotic medication relative to unmedicated individuals. Negative correlations between age and bilateral temporal pole thickness were stronger in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy volunteers. Regional cortical thickness showed significant negative correlations with normalized medication dose, symptom severity, and duration of illness and positive correlations with age at onset. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the ENIGMA meta-analysis approach can achieve robust findings in clinical neuroscience studies; also, medication effects should be taken into account in future genetic association studies of cortical thickness in schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl"

Large-scale neuroimaging studies have revealed group differences in  cortical thickness across many psychiatric disorders. The underlying neurobiology behind these differences is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine neurobiologic correlates of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls in 6 disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Profiles of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Similarity between interregional profiles of cell-specific gene expression and those in the group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each disorder. Next, principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile of group difference in thickness across the disorders. Analysis for gene coexpression, clustering, and enrichment for genes associated with these disorders were conducted. Data analysis was conducted between June and December 2019. The analysis included 145 cohorts across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from the ENIGMA consortium. The numbers of cases and controls in each of the 6 disorders were as follows: ADHD: 1814 and 1602; ASD: 1748 and 1770; BD: 1547 and 3405; MDD: 2658 and 3572; OCD: 2266 and 2007; and schizophrenia: 2688 and 3244. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interregional profiles of group difference in cortical thickness between cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 12 721 cases and 15 600 controls, ranging from ages 2 to 89 years, were included in this study. Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for each of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression specific to pyramidal (CA1) cells, astrocytes (except for BD), and microglia (except for OCD); collectively, gene-expression profiles of the 3 cell types explain between 25% and 54% of variance in interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness. Principal component analysis revealed a shared profile of difference in cortical thickness across the 6 disorders (48% variance explained); interregional profile of this principal component 1 was associated with that of the pyramidal-cell gene expression (explaining 56% of interregional variation). Coexpression analyses of these genes revealed 2 clusters: (1) a prenatal cluster enriched with genes involved in neurodevelopmental (axon guidance) processes and (2) a postnatal cluster enriched with genes involved in synaptic activity and plasticity-related processes. These clusters were enriched with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, shared neurobiologic processes were associated with differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric disorders. These processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and postnatal functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandler, Kate</author><author>Volk, Holger</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Jeffery, Nick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>324</pages><volume>162</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18326849</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.162.10.324-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hechler, Ashley C</author><author>Hostnik, Eric T</author><author>Cook, Laurie B</author><author>Cole, Lynette K</author><author>Moore, Sarah A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanical quantitative sensory testing in cavalier King Charles spaniels with  and without syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>94</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Sensory Thresholds</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32197618</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-020-02313-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia (SM) is a debilitating condition in the cavalier King  Charles spaniel (CKCS) that results in neuropathic pain and diminished quality of life. Von Frey aesthesiometry (VFA) is a method of mechanical quantitative sensory testing that provides an objective sensory threshold (ST) value and can be used to quantify neuropathic pain (NP) and monitor response to therapy. The utility of VFA has been previously established in client-owned dogs with acute spinal cord injury but the technique has not been evaluated in dogs with SM. The goal of this study was to evaluate ST, as determined by VFA, in dogs with and without SM, to assess the utility of VFA in quantifying NP in SM-affected dogs. We hypothesized the SM-affected CKCS would have lower ST values, consistent with hyperesthesia, when compared to control CKCS. Additionally, we hypothesized that ST values in SM-affected dogs would be inversely correlated with syrinx size on MRI and with owner-derived clinical sign scores. RESULTS: ST values for the thoracic and pelvic limbs differed significantly between the SM-affected and control CKCS (p = 0.027; p = 0.0396 respectively). Median ST value (range) for the thoracic limbs was 184.1 g (120.9-552) for control dogs, and 139.9 g (52.6-250.9) for SM-affected dogs. The median ST value (range) for the pelvic limbs was 164.9 g (100.8-260.3) in control dogs and 129.8 g (57.95-168.4) in SM-affected dogs. The ST values in SM-affected dogs did not correlate with syrinx height on MRI (r = 0.314; p = 0.137). Owner-reported clinical sign scores showed an inverse correlation with pelvic limb ST values, where dogs with lower ST values (hyperesthesia) were reported by their owners to display more frequent and severe clinical signs (r = - 0.657; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: ST values were lower in SM-affected CKCS compared to control dogs, suggesting the presence of neuropathic pain. Dogs with lower ST pelvic limb values were perceived by their owners to have more severe clinical signs classically associated with SM. Our results suggest that VFA might offer quantitative assessment of neuropathic pain in SM-affected dogs and could be useful for monitoring response to therapy in future clinical studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cardy, Thomas J A</author><author>Tzounos, Caitlin E</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author><author>De Decker, Steven</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characterization of thoracolumbar and lumbar intervertebral disk  extrusions in English Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>405-412</pages><volume>248</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</keyword><keyword>Lumbar Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Thoracic Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26829272</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.248.4.405</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To assess the anatomic distribution of thoracolumbar and lumbar  intervertebral disk extrusions (IVDEs) in English Cocker Spaniels as compared with findings in Dachshunds and to characterize clinical findings in English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar or lumbar IVDEs affecting various regions of the vertebral column. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. ANIMALS: 81 English Cocker Spaniels and 81 Dachshunds with IVDEs. PROCEDURES: Signalment, clinical signs, neurologic examination findings, and affected intervertebral disk spaces (IVDSs) were recorded for both breeds. Management methods and outcomes were recorded for English Cocker Spaniels. Lesions were categorized as thoracolumbar (IVDSs T9-10 through L1-2), midlumbar (L2-3 through L4-5), or caudal lumbar (L5-6 through L7-S1). RESULTS: Midlumbar and caudal lumbar IVDEs were significantly more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds. English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDEs had a longer median duration of clinical signs before evaluation and more commonly had unilateral pelvic limb lameness or spinal hyperesthesia as the predominant clinical sign than did those with IVDEs at other sites. Those with caudal lumbar IVDEs less commonly had neurologic deficits and had a higher median neurologic grade (indicating lesser severity), shorter mean postoperative hospitalization time, and faster mean time to ambulation after surgery than those with other sites affected. These variables did not differ between English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar and midlumbar IVDEs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Caudal and midlumbar IVDEs were more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds. English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDE had clinical signs and posttreatment responses that differed from those in dogs with midlumbar or thoracolumbar IVDE.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaimio, Mirja</author><author>Malkamäki, Sanna</author><author>Kaukonen, Maria</author><author>Ahonen, Saija</author><author>Hytönen, Marjo K</author><author>Rantala, Merja</author><author>Lohi, Hannes</author><author>Saijonmaa-Koulumies, Leena</author><author>Laitinen-Vapaavuori, Outi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and Genetic Findings in 28 American Cocker Spaniels with Aural  Ceruminous Gland Hyperplasia and Ectasia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>30-44</pages><volume>185</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apocrine Glands</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dilatation, Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Hyperplasia</keyword><keyword>Otitis Externa</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34119229</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2021.03.005</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>American Cocker Spaniels (ACSs) develop aural ceruminous gland hyperplasia and  ectasia more often than dogs of other breeds. Data on the cause and development of these breed characteristic histopathological changes are lacking. We performed video-otoscopic examinations and dermatological work-up on 28 ACSs, obtained aural biopsies from each dog and assessed the statistical associations between the presence of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia and disease history, clinical or microbiological findings and underlying cause of otitis externa (OE). Histological lesions of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia were observed in aural biopsies from 6/13 clinically healthy ears and 13/15 ears with OE from 19/28 examined dogs. Nine of 28 dogs had histologically normal ceruminous glands (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-36.6). Bacterial growth in microbiological culture of aural exudate (OR 14.1, 95% CI 2.1-95.3) was associated with ceruminous glandular changes, whereas previous history of OE, cutaneous findings or underlying allergies were not. Pedigree analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) were performed on 18 affected and eight unaffected dogs based on histopathological diagnosis. While the GWAS indicated a tentative, but not statistically significant, association of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia with chromosome 31, a larger cohort is needed to confirm this preliminary result. Based on our results, ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia may also precede clinical signs of OE in ACSs and a genetic aetiological component is likely Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to verify our preliminary results.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Ghilardi, Sara</author><author>Locatelli, Chiara</author><author>Bionda, Arianna</author><author>Polli, Michele</author><author>Bussadori, Claudio M</author><author>Colombo, Fabio M</author><author>Pazzagli, Laura</author><author>Brambilla, Paola G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of Morphometry on Echocardiographic Measurements in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels: An Inverse Probability Weighting Analysis.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34679035</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/vetsci8100205</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The development and progression of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are difficult to predict. Thus, the identification of dogs with a morphotype associated with more severe mitral disease at a young age is desirable. The aims of this study were to: (1) describe the physical, morphometric, and echocardiographic features of class B1 MMVD-affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines; (2) evaluate the influence of morphometric physical measurements on murmur intensity, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), regurgitant jet size, and indexed mitral valve and annulus measurements. Fifty-two MMVD-affected CKCS were included in the ACVIM class B1. This is a prospective clinical cross-sectional study. Morphometric measurements, which included the body, thorax, and head sizes of each dog, were investigated to establish the association with heart murmur intensity, valvular and annular echocardiographic measurements, MVP, and regurgitant jet size, using inverse probability weighting (IPW) analyses to adjust for confounding. The IPW analyses showed that when the head length and nose length decreased, dogs had a more severe regurgitant jet size. Furthermore, subjects with a more pronounced head stop angle had thicker anterior mitral valve leaflets. A brachycephalic morphotype, as seen in dogs similar to the King Charles Spaniel breed in terms of cephalic morphology, is associated with a more severe regurgitant jet size and with valvular characteristics that are related to the most severe forms of MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bionda, Arianna</author><author>Cortellari, Matteo</author><author>Bagardi, Mara</author><author>Frattini, Stefano</author><author>Negro, Alessio</author><author>Locatelli, Chiara</author><author>Brambilla, Paola Giuseppina</author><author>Crepaldi, Paola</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Genomic Study of Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33081147</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani10101895</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) show the earliest onset and the highest  incidence of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Previous studies have suggested a polygenic inheritance of the disease in this breed and revealed an association with regions on canine chromosomes 13 and 14. Following clinical and echocardiographic examinations, 33 not-directly-related CKCSs were selected and classified as cases (n = 16) if MMVD was present before 5 years of age or as controls (n = 17) if no or very mild MMVD was present after 5 years of age. DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyped with a Canine 230K SNP BeadChip instrument. Cases and controls were compared with three complementary genomic analyses (Wright's fixation index-F(ST), cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity-XP-EHH, and runs of homozygosity-ROH) to identify differences in terms of heterozygosity and regions of homozygosity. The top 1% single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and mapped, and the genes were thoroughly investigated. Ten consensus genes were found localized on chromosomes 3-11-14-19, partially confirming previous studies. The HEPACAM2, CDK6, and FAH genes, related to the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway and heart development, also emerged in the ROH analysis. In conclusion, this work expands the knowledge of the genetic basis of MMVD by identifying genes involved in the early onset of MMVD in CKCSs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Erratum for Morphometric analysis of spinal cord termination in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1840</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31321833</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15514</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marcellin-Little, D J</author><author>DeYoung, D J</author><author>Ferris, K K</author><author>Berry, C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>475-487</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7871711</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950x.1994.tb00509.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An evaluation of 157 dogs with humeral fractures was performed. Cocker spaniels  were more likely to have humeral condylar fractures (HCFs) than other breeds (P &lt; .001). Male cocker spaniels were at increased risk (P &lt; .001). Cocker spaniels had more bilateral HCFs than other breeds of dogs (P &lt; .001). Eighteen dogs (17 purebred spaniels and 1 crossbred spaniel) with HCFs of unknown cause or occurring with normal activity were further studied, using radiography of their humeral condyle bilaterally (n = 18), computed tomography (n = 3), biopsy (n = 2), bone scintigraphy (n = 2), and genetic evaluation (n = 8). Fourteen of these 18 dogs had a nonfractured contralateral condyle. Twelve (86%) of the 14 nonfractured humeral condyles had a radiolucent line within the center of the condyle, 13 (93%) had radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease and an abnormal medial coronoid process, and six (43%) had periosteal proliferation involving the lateral epicondyle. Examination of biopsy samples from the fracture sites of two cocker spaniels showed fibrous tissue present at the fracture surfaces. The results of this study suggest an association between incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in cocker spaniels and Brittany spaniels and a high prevalence of HCFs. Eight affected cocker spaniels with available pedigree information were found to be genetically related, suggesting that incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle may be a genetic disease with a recessive mode of inheritance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bell, E T</author><author>Griffin, P</author><author>Martinello, P</author><author>Robinson, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary ciliary dyskinesia in two English Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>149-153</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27113985</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.12418</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited condition  characterised by structural and functional defects of ciliated cells.

Data are lacking on the clinical relevance of alterations in their spinal cord terminal structures. OBJECTIVES: To compare spinal cord termination level and filum terminale internum length (FTIL) with presence of lumbar SM and clinical signs in CKCS. ANIMALS: Forty-eight CKCS. METHODS: In this prospective study, pain was quantified using owner and clinician assessments. Vertebral level of spinal cord and dural sac termination, presence of SM, and FTIL were determined from sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Kappa and intraclass correlation (ICC) analyses determined interobserver reliability. The MRI findings were compared to owner and clinician-reported pain quantification. RESULTS: Interobserver reliability was good for spinal cord and dural sac termination (kappa = 0.61 and 0.64, respectively) and excellent for FTIL (ICC: 92% agreement). The spinal cord terminated at 6th lumbar vertebra in 1, 7th lumbar vertebra in 31, and the sacrum in 15 dogs, and termination level was associated with lumbar SM (P = .002) but not clinical signs. Mean FTIL was 2.9 ± 1.08 mm; it was associated with owner-reported pain (P = .033) and spinal palpation scores (P = .023). Painful CKCS without SM had shorter FTIL compared to normal CKCS and painful CKCS with SM (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Painful CKCS without SM have decreased distance between the termination of the spinal cord and dural sac, suggesting a shorter FTIL. More caudal spinal cord termination is associated with development of lumbar SM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>MacSweeny, J E</author><author>Davies, J V</author><author>Chandler, K</author><author>Fitzmaurice, S N</author><author>Dennis, R</author><author>Cappello, R</author><author>Wheeler, S J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syringohydromyelia in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>34-41</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10667404</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-36-1-34</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Syringohydromyelia secondary to foramen magnum overcrowding is described in seven  Cavalier King Charles spaniels.

This led to the hypothesis that mechanical sensory threshold is altered in clinical cases. The aim of this study was to quantify the cervical mechanical sensory threshold using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments in nine Cavalier King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and assumed syringomyelia-associated central neuropathic pain compared to eight control dogs. Clinical and neurological examination including magnetic resonance imaging was undertaken. Mean mechanical sensory threshold was not significantly different between case and control dogs (t-test on log10 transformed data; P=0.25). Substantial variation within and between dogs was seen, with individual thresholds ranging from 0.04 to 26g in case dogs and from 0.02 to 10g in control dogs. Based on these results, it is unlikely that Cavalier King Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia have increased mechanical sensation characterised by lower mechanical sensory threshold when quantified with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Whether clinical cases experience central neuropathic pain remains unknown. The assessment of sensory function in dogs with assumed central neuropathic pain should be multimodal and include not only mechanical but also tactile and thermal threshold quantification. The use of threshold quantification in a clinical setting is challenging due to an insufficient signal relative to the biological background noise within and between dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal

The puppy underwent a physical and neurological examination, serum biochemistry and complete blood cell count, electrophysiological testing, muscle biopsy and whole genome sequencing. Clinical evaluation revealed generalized neuromuscular weakness with tetraparesis and difficulty holding the head up and a dropped jaw. There was diffuse spontaneous activity on electromyography, most severe in the cervical musculature. Nerve conduction studies were normal, the findings were interpreted as consistent with a myopathy. Skeletal muscle was grossly abnormal on biopsy and there were necklace fibers and abnormal triad structure localization on histopathology, consistent with myotubular myopathy. Whole genome sequencing revealed a premature stop codon in exon 13 of MTM1 (ChrX: 118,903,496 C &gt; T, c.1467C&gt;T, p.Arg512X). The puppy was humanely euthanized at 5 months of age. The puppy's dam was heterozygous for the variant, and 3 male puppies from a subsequent litter all of which died by 2 weeks of age were hemizygous for the variant. This naturally occurring mutation in Boykin spaniels causes a severe form of X-linked myotubular myopathy, comparable to the human counterpart.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schulze, Sabine</author><author>Refai, Miriam</author><author>Deutschland, Martin</author><author>Failing, Klaus</author><author>Schmidt, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of syringomyelia in clinically unaffected Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels in Germany (2006-2016).</title><secondary-title>Tierarztliche Praxis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2006 to 2016 a total of 339 asymptomatic CKCSs from all over Germany were included. Age ranged from 3 months to 11 years (mean 3.72 years ± 2.17 years). T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the head and cervical spine were obtained. RESULTS: Overall, 163 out of 339 (48.1 %) CKCSs showed evidence of syringomyelia. The results (odds ratio of 1.27 per year; p &lt; 0.0001) corroborate the findings of other studies, in which the risk of developing syringomyelia increases with age. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In conclusion, around half of the dogs within the German CKCS population are affected by syringomyelia. The prevalence of syringomyelia of the German CKCS population is similar to that of the British CKCS population, which is subjected to breeding strategies on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging investigations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Axelsson, Erik</author><author>Ljungvall, Ingrid</author><author>Bhoumik, Priyasma</author><author>Conn, Laura Bas</author><author>Muren, Eva</author><author>Ohlsson, Åsa</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth Høier</author><author>Engdahl, Karolina</author><author>Hagman, Ragnvi</author><author>Hanson, Jeanette</author><author>Kryvokhyzha, Dmytro</author><author>Pettersson, Mats</author><author>Grenet, Olivier</author><author>Moggs, Jonathan</author><author>Del Rio-Espinola, Alberto</author><author>Epe, Christian</author><author>Taillon, Bruce</author><author>Tawari, Nilesh</author><author>Mane, Shrinivas</author><author>Hawkins, Troy</author><author>Hedhammar, Åke</author><author>Gruet, Philippe</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The genetic consequences of dog breed formation-Accumulation of deleterious  genetic variation and fixation of mutations associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>e1009726</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34473707</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1009726</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Selective breeding for desirable traits in strictly controlled populations has  generated an extraordinary diversity in canine morphology and behaviour, but has also led to loss of genetic variation and random entrapment of disease alleles. As a consequence, specific diseases are now prevalent in certain breeds, but whether the recent breeding practice led to an overall increase in genetic load remains unclear. Here we generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 20 dogs per breed from eight breeds and document a ~10% rise in the number of derived alleles per genome at evolutionarily conserved sites in the heavily bottlenecked cavalier King Charles spaniel breed (cKCs) relative to in most breeds studied here. Our finding represents the first clear indication of a relative increase in levels of deleterious genetic variation in a specific breed, arguing that recent breeding practices probably were associated with an accumulation of genetic load in dogs. We then use the WGS data to identify candidate risk alleles for the most common cause for veterinary care in cKCs-the heart disease myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). We verify a potential link to MMVD for candidate variants near the heart specific NEBL gene in a dachshund population and show that two of the NEBL candidate variants have regulatory potential in heart-derived cell lines and are associated with reduced NEBL isoform nebulette expression in papillary muscle (but not in mitral valve, nor in left ventricular wall). Alleles linked to reduced nebulette expression may hence predispose cKCs and other breeds to MMVD via loss of papillary muscle integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polton, Gerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anal sac gland carcinoma in cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>608</pages><volume>163</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Gland Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Specimen Collection</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Research</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>19011255</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.163.20.608-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Poucke, Mario</author><author>Stee, Kimberley</author><author>Lowrie, Mark</author><author>Peelman, Luc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The c.126C&gt;A(p.(Cys42Ter)) SLC7A10 nonsense variant is a candidate causative  variant for paradoxical pseudomyotonia in English Cocker and Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36869603</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/age.13312</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Paradoxical pseudomyotonia has previously been described in the English Cocker  Spaniel (ECS) and English Springer Spaniel (ESS) breeds, without the identification of potentially causative variants. This disease is characterised by episodes of exercise-induced generalised myotonic-like muscle stiffness, phenotypically similar to congenital pseudomyotonia in cattle, and paramyotonia congenita and Brody disease in people. Four additional affected ESS dogs with paradoxical pseudomyotonia are described in this report, together with the identification of the autosomal recessive c.126C&gt;A(p.(Cys42Ter)) SLC7A10 nonsense variant as candidate disease-causing variant in both ECS and ESS. The variant has an estimated prevalence of 2.5% in both breeds in the British study samples, but was not identified in the Belgian study samples. Genetic testing-based breeding should be a useful tool to eliminate this disease in the future, although an effective treatment option is available for severely affected dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsen, Emil</author><author>Suiter, Emma Jane</author><author>Pfau, Thilo</author><author>McGonnell, Imelda M</author><author>Matiasek, Kaspar</author><author>Giejda, Anna</author><author>Volk, Holger Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like malformation and Syringomyelia  have increased variability of spatio-temporal gait characteristics.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>159</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gait</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28587601</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-017-1077-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chiari-like malformation in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a  herniation of the cerebellum and brainstem into or through the foramen magnum. This condition predisposes to Syringomyelia; fluid filled syrinxes within the spinal cord. The resulting pathology in spinal cord and cerebellum create neuropathic pain and changes in gait. This study aims to quantify the changes in gait for Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with Chiari-like malformation and Syringomyelia. METHODS: We compared Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with Chiari-like malformation with (n = 9) and without (n = 8) Syringomyelia to Border Terriers (n = 8). Two video cameras and manual tracking was used to quantify gait parameters. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant increase in coefficient of variation for the spatio-temporal characteristics and ipsilateral distance between paws and a wider base of support in the thoracic limbs but not in the pelvic limbs for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels compared with the border terrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kubai, Melissa A</author><author>Labelle, Amber L</author><author>Hamor, Ralph E</author><author>Mutti, Donald O</author><author>Famula, Thomas R</author><author>Murphy, Christopher J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heritability of lenticular myopia in English Springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</full-title></periodical><pages>7324-7328</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Markov Chains</keyword><keyword>Myopia</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Quantitative Trait, Heritable</keyword><keyword>Refractive Errors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24071952</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.12-10993</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: We determined whether naturally-occurring lenticular myopia in English  Springer spaniels (ESS) has a genetic component. METHODS: Streak retinoscopy was performed on 226 related ESS 30 minutes after the onset of pharmacologic mydriasis and cycloplegia. A pedigree was constructed to determine relationships between affected offspring and parents. Estimation of heritability was done in a Bayesian analysis (facilitated by the MCMCglmm package of R) of refractive error in a model, including terms for sex and coat color. Myopia was defined as ≤-0.5 diopters (D) spherical equivalent. RESULTS: The median refractive error for ESS was 0.25 D (range, -3.5 to +4.5 D). Median age was 0.2 years (range, 0.1-15 years). The prevalence of myopia in related ESS was 19% (42/226). The ESS had a strong correlation (r = 0.95) for refractive error between the two eyes. Moderate heritability was present for refractive error with a mean value of 0.29 (95% highest probability density, 0.07-0.50). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of refractive error, and subsequently lenticular myopia, has a moderate genetic component in ESS.

Inspection of cases where the disease segregated within families pointed to genes at more than one locus influencing syringomyelia.

Dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class II genes encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that are involved in antigen presentation to CD4(+) T cells. Several DLA haplotypes have been associated with autoimmune disease, including IMHA, in dogs, and breed specific differences have been identified. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a critical molecule involved in the regulation of T-cell responses. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CTLA4 promoter have been shown to be associated with several autoimmune diseases in humans and more recently with diabetes mellitus and hypoadrenocorticism in dogs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether DLA-DQB1 alleles or CTLA4 promoter variability are associated with risk of IMHA in Cocker spaniels. RESULTS: There were a restricted number of DLA-DQB1 alleles identified, with a high prevalence of DLA-DQB1*007:01 in both groups. A high prevalence of DLA-DQB1 homozygosity was identified, although there was no significant difference between IMHA cases and controls. CTLA4 promoter haplotype diversity was limited in Cocker spaniels, with all dogs expressing at least one copy of haplotype 8. There was no significant difference comparing haplotypes in the IMHA affected group versus control group (p = 0.23). Homozygosity for haplotype 8 was common in Cocker spaniels with IMHA (27/29; 93 %) and in controls (52/63; 83 %), with no statistically significant difference in prevalence between the two groups (p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: DLA-DQB1 allele and CTLA4 promoter haplotype were not found to be significantly associated with IMHA in Cocker spaniels. Homozygosity for DLA-DQB1*007:01 and the presence of CTLA4 haplotype 8 in Cocker spaniels might increase overall susceptibility to IMHA in this breed, with other genetic and environmental factors involved in disease expression and progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knowler, Susan P</author><author>Dumas, Eleonore</author><author>Spiteri, Michaela</author><author>McFadyen, Angus K</author><author>Stringer, Felicity</author><author>Wells, Kevin</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Facial changes related to brachycephaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with  Chiari-like malformation associated pain and secondary syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>237-246</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Face</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31691386</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15632</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Recent studies including an innovative machine learning technique  indicated Chiari-like malformation (CM) is influenced by brachycephalic features. OBJECTIVES: Morphometric analysis of facial anatomy and dysmorphia in CM-associated pain (CM-P) and syringomyelia (SM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). ANIMALS: Sixty-six client-owned CKCS. METHODS: Retrospective study of anonymized T2W sagittal magnetic resonance imaging of 3 clinical groups: (1) 11 without central canal dilation (ccd) or SM (CM-N), (2) 15 with CM-P with no SM or &lt;2 mm ccd (CM-P), and (3) 40 with syrinx width ≥4 mm (SM-S). Morphometric analysis assessed rostral skull flattening and position of the hard and soft palate relative to the cranial base in each clinical group and compared CKCS with and without SM-S. RESULTS: Sixteen of 28 measured variables were associated to SM-S compared to CM-N and CM-P. Of these 6 were common to both groups. Predictive variables determined by discriminant analysis were (1) the ratio of cranial height with cranial length (P &lt; .001 between SM-S and CM-N) and (2) the distance between the cerebrum and the frontal bone (P &lt; .001 between SM-S and CM-P). CM-P had the lowest mean height of the maxillary area. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: CKCS with CM-P and SM-S have cranial brachycephaly with osseous insufficiency in the skull with rostral flattening and increased proximity of the hard and soft palate to the cranial base. Changes are greatest with CM-P. These findings have relevance for understanding disease pathogenesis and for selection of head conformation for breeding purposes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polton, Gerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anal sac gland carcinoma in cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>244</pages><volume>160</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Gland Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17308030</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.160.7.244-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shaw, T A</author><author>McGonnell, I M</author><author>Driver, C J</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Volk, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Caudal cranial fossa partitioning in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>341</pages><volume>172</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Axial Joint</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Occipital Joint</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23385008</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.101082</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parker, J E</author><author>Knowler, S P</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Noorman, E</author><author>Jeffery, N D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of asymptomatic syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>667</pages><volume>168</volume><issue>25</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Selection, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21672954</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.d1726</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The prevalence of syringomyelia was investigated in a sample population of 555  Cavalier King Charles spaniels.

People suffer from a similar condition and describe numerous sensory abnormalities. Sensory changes have not been quantified in affected CKCS. OBJECTIVES: To use quantitative sensory testing (QST) to quantify thermal and mechanical thresholds in CKCS and to compare QST in dogs with and without syringomyelia (SM). ANIMALS: Forty-four CKCS. METHODS: Prospective study. Dogs underwent neurological examinations and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thermal testing was performed over the humerus and thorax (n = 32); mechanical testing was performed on the paw and neck (n = 44). Latencies, thresholds, and response rates were compared with presence and severity of SM on MRI, presence of pain reported by the owner and pain identified on examination. RESULTS: Thirty dogs had SM, 30 were painful on examination, 29 were owner-reported symptomatic. Thermal and mechanical variables were not significantly different based on presence or severity of SM. Dogs with pain on examination had decreased mechanical thresholds on the paw (0.38 kg, SD = 0.18) and neck (2.05 kg, SD = 0.74) compared to thresholds of dogs without pain on examination on the paw (0.60 kg, SD = 0.30) and neck (2.72 kg, SD = 0.57; P = .021). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Mechanical and thermal sensitivity does not appear to be related to the presence of SM, but mechanical sensitivity appears to be related to the presence of pain and clinical signs. Mechanical testing may be useful for assessing sensory abnormalities during clinical trials.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dickson, D</author><author>Shave, R</author><author>Rishniw, M</author><author>Patteson, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Echocardiographic assessments of longitudinal left ventricular function  in healthy English Springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>339-350</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography, Doppler</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Function, Left</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28615148</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2017.04.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To establish reference intervals for echocardiographic measures of  longitudinal left ventricular function in adult English Springer spaniel (ESS) dogs. ANIMALS: This study involved 42 healthy adult ESS. METHODS: Animals were prospectively recruited from a general practice population in the United Kingdom. Dogs were examined twice, at least 12 months apart, to exclude dogs with progressive cardiac disease. Mitral annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler imaging mitral annular velocities and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic left ventricular longitudinal strain and strain rate were measured. Intraoperator and intraobserver variability were examined and reference intervals were calculated. The potential effects of body weight, age and heart rate on these variables were examined. RESULTS: Intraoperator and intraobserver variability was &lt;10% for all parameters except tissue Doppler imaging E' (the peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion as determined by pulsed wave Doppler) and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic variables, which were all &lt;20%. Thirty-nine dogs were used to create reference intervals. Significant (but mostly weak) effects of age, heart rate and body weight on were detected. Reference intervals were similar to previously published values in different breeds. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Breed specific reference intervals for measures of longitudinal left ventricular function in the ESS are presented.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, P J</author><author>Roulois, A</author><author>Scase, T</author><author>Holloway, A</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of chronic pancreatitis in English Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>797-804</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21689157</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0744.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is common in dogs. The cause is unknown. In  humans, different causes of pancreatitis have histologically distinct appearances. The histopathologic lesions in English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) with CP were noted to be histologically different than those of other breeds with CP. HYPOTHESIS: CP in ECS is distinct from CP in other breeds and is characterized by a duct destruction similar to what is observed in autoimmune CP of humans. ANIMALS: Eight ECS and 9 other breeds with histologically confirmed CP recruited over an 8-year period and 50 postmortem control dogs with CP. METHODS: Clinical, clinicopathological, and ultrasonographic findings were recorded. Histological sections were compared with a normal dog and 59 dogs of other breeds with CP. Immunohistochemistry using anti-CD3, anti-CD79a, and anti-cytokeratin antibodies was used to evaluate distribution and type of lymphocytic inflammation and appearance of pancreatic ducts. RESULTS: Four male and 4 female ECS presented at a mean age of 7.2 years. Clinical signs were similar in ECS and other breeds. The pancreas was enlarged and hypoechoic in 4 ECS and 2 controls. Histopathology was characterized by interlobular and periductular fibrosis and inflammation in ECS compared with intralobular disease in most other breeds. Immunohistochemistry identified prominent anti-CD3(+) lymphocytic infiltrates around venules and ducts and a marked absence of interlobular ducts in ECS compared with mixed T-cell infiltration and ductular hyperplasia in most other breeds with CP. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: CP in ECS is distinct from CP in other breeds and is notably duct destructive.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fonfara, S</author><author>Loureiro, J F</author><author>Swift, S</author><author>James, R A</author><author>Pereira, Y Martinez</author><author>Lopez-Alvarez, J</author><author>Summerfield, N</author><author>Dukes-McEwan, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>English springer spaniels with significant bradyarrhythmias--presentation,  troponin I and follow-up after pacemaker implantation.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>155-161</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bradycardia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pacemaker, Artificial</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Troponin I</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20070495</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00867.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: English springer spaniels (ESS) are one of the most frequently  presented breeds for pacemaker implantation in the UK and may do so at an early age. In comparison to dogs of other breeds (non-ESS) presenting for pacemaker implantation, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), the outcome and survival of ESS were investigated. METHODS: Case records of dogs receiving pacemaker implantation were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Between September 2004 and October 2008, 58 dogs were presented to the Small Animal Teaching Hospital, University of Liverpool for pacemaker implantation. ESS (n=10) was the second most commonly presented breed. ESS were significantly younger than non-ESS (P=0.022). cTnI values were elevated on presentation and a significant reduction was present after pacemaker implantation (P=0.008) in all dogs. No significant difference in initial cTnI was identified comparing ESS and non-ESS (P=0.45) and median survival times were similar (P=0.37). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: ESS may be predisposed to bradyarrhythmias requiring pacemaker implantation. They present at a significantly younger age than non-ESS. Survival times between ESS and non-ESS were similar, despite ESS being paced at a younger age. However, pacemaker implantation is recommended in ESS, as median survival times of 30 months with a good quality of life were achieved.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, Penny</author><author>Skancke, Ellen</author><author>Farstad, Wenche</author><author>Sampson, Jeff</author><author>Bloomfield, Lesley</author><author>Scott, Louise</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatitis in English springer spaniels in the UK and Norway.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>311</pages><volume>158</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Norway</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16517830</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.158.9.311</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koll-Hampp, Sarah</author><author>Enache, Andra-Elena</author><author>Fenollosa-Romero, Elena</author><author>Chang, Yu-Mei</author><author>Busse, Claudia</author><author>Oliver, James</author><author>Dawson, Charlotte</author><author>Matas Riera, Màrian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Visual outcome following phacoemulsification in English Cocker Spaniels with  suspected progressive retinal atrophy: A retrospective multicenter study of 54 cases (2002-2017).</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>591-599</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Cataract Extraction</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phacoemulsification</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Vision, Ocular</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30706615</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12627</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the visual outcome following phacoemulsification in  English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) affected by cataracts and suspected progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). ANIMALS STUDIED: Fifty-four client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES: A multicenter, retrospective study was performed including ECS with suspected PRA which underwent phacoemulsification. PRA was suspected on ophthalmic examination before and after surgery, and/or after electroretinography (ERG) was performed. Visual outcome was assessed by menace response per eye at seven time periods post-surgery (P1= 25-90 days, P2 = 91-180 days, P3 = 181-364 days, P4 = 365-549 days, P5 = 550-729 days, P6 = 730-1094 days, and P7 ≥ 1095 days). Descriptive statistics were performed. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify predictors associated with vision after surgery. Odds ratio and confidence intervals were reported. Significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. Owners were invited to participate in a questionnaire. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed in 85 eyes. Median age at surgery was 9.09 years (min. 2.17 years, max. 13.49 years). At all re-examinations, up to and including P5, significantly more eyes were visual than before surgery (P ≤ 0.003). Odds for vision were significantly increased for eyes that underwent surgery. Electroretinograms were performed in 75/85 eyes that underwent surgery, demonstrating low b-wave amplitudes. There was no significant effect of the age, gender, vision before surgery, presence of dazzle reflex, cataract stage or abnormality on gonioscopy on visual outcome. The questionnaire response rate was 48.2%. Most participants (92.5%) felt that cataract surgery led to improvement of the dog's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: English Cocker Spaniels with suspected PRA may benefit from phacoemulsification with vision up to 2 years following surgery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Darke, P G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Valvular incompetence in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>365-366</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Auscultation</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>3590588</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.120.15.365</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coddou, M F</author><author>Constantino-Casas, F</author><author>Scase, T</author><author>Day, M J</author><author>Blacklaws, B</author><author>Watson, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic Inflammatory Disease in the Pancreas, Kidney and Salivary Glands of  English Cocker Spaniels and Dogs of Other Breeds Shows Similar Histological Features to Human IgG4-related Disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>18-33</pages><volume>177</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Conjunctiva</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulin G</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Pancreas</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Plasma Cells</keyword><keyword>Salivary Glands</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32505237</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.03.008</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a common disease in the English cocker spaniel (ECS)  and is characterized histologically by duct destruction, interlobular fibrosis and dense periductular and perivenous lymphocytic aggregates. These features are also found in human autoimmune pancreatitis type 1, part of a glucocorticoid-responsive, multiorgan syndrome, newly recognized as IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Human IgG4-RD affects one or several organs, often showing a predominance of IgG4(+) plasma cells histologically, with an IgG4(+):total IgG(+) plasma cell ratio of &gt;40%. This study investigated whether ECSs with CP and/or inflammatory disease in several organs show an increase in IgG4(+) plasma cells within affected tissues. Histological sections of pancreas, liver, kidney, salivary gland and conjunctiva were obtained from ECSs with idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease affecting those tissues. Tissue samples from age-matched dogs of other breeds with similar diseases were also sampled. Control diseased tissue samples, from dogs without a suspected immune-mediated disease, were included. A subset of ECSs and dogs of other breeds presented with disease in more than one organ. Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary reagents detecting total IgG and three of the four canine IgG subclasses (IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). Normal sections of pancreas and liver showed an absence of labelled plasma cells of any subclass. Normal kidney and salivary gland sections showed the presence of a few labelled plasma cells (&lt;10 plasma cells/high-power field). Fourteen tissue sections from 12 ECSs and seven sections from six dogs of other breeds showed elevated numbers of IgG4(+) plasma cells and IgG4(+):IgG(+) ratios &gt;40%. Individual dogs (ECSs and other breeds) showed marked increases in IgG4(+) cells. There were no significant differences in the number of IgG4(+) plasma cells between ECSs and dogs of other breeds for affected pancreas, liver, salivary glands and conjunctiva. Kidney sections had more IgG4(+) cells, for both ECSs and dogs of other breeds, than did sections from other organs. Dogs of other breeds had significantly more IgG4(+) plasma cells in affected kidneys than ECSs. In conclusion, several ECSs and dogs of other breeds fulfilled the histological criteria for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, supporting the existence of a multiorgan immune-mediated disease in ECSs and some dogs of other breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Engelhardt, Anja</author><author>Stock, Kathrin F</author><author>Hamann, Henning</author><author>Brahm, Rolf</author><author>Grussendorf, Heinrich</author><author>Rosenhagen, Carsten U</author><author>Distl, Ottmar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A retrospective study on the prevalence of primary cataracts in two pedigrees  from the German population of English Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>215-221</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Germany</keyword><keyword>Hair Color</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Quantitative Trait, Heritable</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18638346</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2008.00628.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: Two pedigrees from the German English Cocker Spaniel population are  presented to illustrate the familial occurrence of primary cataract (CAT) in single- and multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The aim was to characterize similarities and differences in the prevalence and formation of CAT in these separately bred color variants of English Cocker Spaniels. MATERIALS: The study was based on the veterinary records for presumed inherited eye diseases of 1232 English Cocker Spaniels which were provided by the German panel of the European Eye Scheme for diagnosis of inherited eye diseases in animals (DOK, &lt;http://www.dok-vet.de&gt;). Data included information on 615 single-colored and 617 multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. RESULTS: CAT was diagnosed in 92 (14.96%) of the single-colored and 34 (5.51%) of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The pedigree of the single-colored English Cocker Spaniels included 40 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 18 unaffected and 22 affected dogs. The pedigree of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels contained 16 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 11 unaffected and five affected dogs. CONCLUSIONS: In both color variants of the English Cocker Spaniels different forms of primary CAT with respect to location within the lens occurred among close relatives. Appearance of CAT was very heterogeneous without obvious sex differences. The sample pedigrees do not support the assumption of familial segregation of specific forms of primary CAT in English Cocker Spaniels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Lynette K</author><author>Rajala-Schultz, Päivi J</author><author>Lorch, Gwendolen</author><author>Daniels, Joshua B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bacteriology and cytology of otic exudates in 41 cavalier King Charles spaniels  with primary secretory otitis media.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>151-e44</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Exudates and Transudates</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30644141</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vde.12724</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) in the cavalier King Charles  spaniel (CKCS) is similar to otitis media with effusion (OME) in humans. A proposed aetiology of OME is inflammation of the middle ear mucosa, usually due to bacterial infection, leading to auditory tube dysfunction. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to characterize the microbiological and cytological findings of otic exudates from the external ear canal (EEC) (n = 68) and middle ear (ME) (n = 69) from 41 CKCSs with PSOM. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Swab samples from the EEC and mucus aspirated from the ME after performing a myringotomy were obtained for bacterial culture and cytological analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five of 68 (81%) EEC and 46 of 69 (67%) ME yielded no bacterial growth. Thirty-eight of the 68 (56%) ears had no microbial growth from neither the EEC nor ME; seven (10%) had bacteria isolated from the EEC only; 17 (25%) had bacteria isolated from the ME only, and six (8%) had bacteria isolated from both EEC and ME. Thirty-four total bacterial isolates were cultured from ME. The most common bacterial species isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Otic cytology identified coccoid organisms in only three of 68 EEC and four of 69 ME. CONCLUSIONS: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of PSOM in CKCS is unclear. The majority of the EEC and ME of the CKCS with PSOM were negative by conventional bacterial culture and the cytological presence of bacteria was not correlated with culture positives. The potential role of noncultivable microbiota in PSOM requires exploration using molecular methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>French, Anne T</author><author>Ogden, Rob</author><author>Eland, Cathlene</author><author>Hemani, Gibran</author><author>Pong-Wong, Ricardo</author><author>Corcoran, Brendan</author><author>Summers, Kim M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide analysis of mitral valve disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>283-286</pages><volume>193</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Heart Auscultation</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22050842</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.09.011</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is prone to severe early onset mitral  valve disease. In this study, 36 purebred CKCS dogs were evaluated for mitral valve murmur and divided into early and late onset groups. A genome-wide genetic approach was used to assess whether the condition is determined by a small number of genetic factors. There were no regions of highly discrepant homo/heterozygosity in the two groups. Similarly, there was no evidence for loci associated with mitral valve murmur in a genome-wide association study.

Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) are frequently affected with MMVD and appear to have different disease progression compared to other dogs. This study aimed to determine if CKCS are more likely to develop PH as a result of MMVD than dogs of other breeds. A secondary aim was to explore whether breed or PH impacted survival. ANIMALS: A total of 187 dogs diagnosed with MMVD, 94 CKCS and 93 non-CKCS, were included in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of dogs with MMVD. Data were analyzed for presence of PH, congestive heart failure (CHF) and echocardiographic variables including the ratio between mitral E wave velocity (E vel) and isovolumic relaxation time (E/IVRT) and were compared between CKCS/non-CKCS and dogs with/without PH. Survival analysis was also performed. RESULTS: American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage (p &lt; 0.001), CKCS (p = 0.005), left atrium-to-aortic ratio (LA/Ao) (p &lt; 0.001), E vel (p &lt; 0.001) and log(10)(E/IVRT) (p &lt; 0.001) were significant at the univariate level for PH development. At the multivariate level, only ACVIM stage remained significant (p = 0.044), suggesting that worsening MMVD was the predominant determinant of PH development in this study. Pulmonary hypertension was associated with greater likelihood of CHF (p &lt; 0.001) and death (both cardiac [p &lt; 0.001] and all-cause mortality [p = 0.011]). Cavalier King Charles spaniels were more likely to experience cardiac death than non-CKCS (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, development of PH was associated with worse MMVD, according to ACVIM stage.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meurs, Kathryn M</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Reimann, Maria J</author><author>Keene, Bruce W</author><author>Atkins, Clarke E</author><author>Adin, Darcy</author><author>Aona, Brent</author><author>Condit, Julia</author><author>DeFrancesco, Teresa</author><author>Reina-Doreste, Yamir</author><author>Stern, Joshua A</author><author>Tou, Sandra</author><author>Ward, Jessica</author><author>Woodruff, Kathleen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with an  ACE gene polymorphism and myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Pharmacogenetics and genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmacogenetics and genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>37-40</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Genetic</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29200408</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/FPC.0000000000000322</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart  disease in the dog. It is particularly common in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) breed and affected dogs are frequently managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). We have previously identified a canine ACE gene polymorphism associated with a decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate for the prevalence of the ACE polymorphism in CKCS with mitral valve disease and to determine whether the presence of the polymorphism is associated with alterations in ACE activity at different stages of cardiac disease. METHODS: Seventy-three dogs with a diagnosis of mitral valve disease were evaluated and a blood sample was drawn for ACE polymorphism genotyping and ACE activity measurement. RESULTS: Forty-three dogs were homozygous for the ACE polymorphism; five were heterozygous and 25 were homozygous wild type. The mean age and the median severity of disease were not different for dogs with the polymorphism and dogs with the wild-type sequence. The median baseline ACE activity was significantly lower for the ACE polymorphism (27.0 U/l) than the wild-type sequence dogs (31.0 U/l) (P=0.02). Dogs with more severe disease and the ACE polymorphism had significantly lower levels of ACE activity than dogs with the wild-type sequence (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: The CKCS appears to have a high prevalence of the ACE variant. Dogs with the ACE variant had lower levels of ACE activity even in more advanced mitral valve disease than dogs without the variant. The clinical significance of this finding and its impact on the need for ACE-I in dogs with the polymorphism and heart disease deserves further study.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kent, A C C</author><author>Constantino-Casas, F</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Corcoran, B M</author><author>Carter, M</author><author>Ledger, T</author><author>Watson, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of pancreatic, hepatic and renal microscopic lesions in post-mortem  samples from Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>188-193</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autopsy</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney Diseases</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pancreas</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26918814</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12444</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of  microscopic pancreatic, hepatic and renal lesions in post-mortem samples from Cavalier King Charles spaniels. METHODS: The prevalence of microscopic lesions was determined by routine histopathology and compared to ante-mortem clinical signs. RESULTS: There was evidence of chronic pancreatitis in 51·9% of the cases, and age correlated with severity. Renal lesions were diagnosed in 52·2% of cases, most of which were inflammatory. Ante-mortem diagnosis of pancreatic and renal disease was 25 and 16·7%, respectively. Primary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 11·1% of cases; secondary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 64·8%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic and renal lesions are common in Cavalier King Charles spaniels, but they have similar rates of hepatic disease as the general population. The increasing prevalence of pancreatic lesions with age suggests that it might be a progressive condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thrift, Elizabeth</author><author>Wimpole, Justin A</author><author>Child, Georgina</author><author>Brown, Narelle</author><author>Gandolfi, Barbara</author><author>Malik, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exercise-induced hyperthermia syndrome (canine stress syndrome) in four related  male English springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)</full-title></periodical><pages>59-68</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>30050857</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/VMRR.S123836</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study describes the signalment, clinical  presentation, diagnostic findings, and mode of inheritance in four young male English springer spaniel dogs with presumptive canine stress syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Appropriate cases were located through medical searches of medical records of two large private referral centers. Inclusion criteria comprised of English springer spaniel dogs with tachypnea and hyperthermia that subsequently developed weakness or collapse, with or without signs of hemorrhage, soon after a period of mild-to-moderate exercise. The pedigrees of the four affected dogs, as well as eleven related English springer spaniels, were then analyzed to determine a presumptive mode of genetic inheritance. RESULTS: Four dogs met the inclusion criteria. All four were male, suggesting the possibility of a recessive sex-linked heritable disorder. Pedigree analysis suggests that more dogs may be potentially affected, although these dogs may have never had the concurrent triggering drug/activity/event to precipitate the clinical syndrome. There was complete resolution of clinical signs in three of the four dogs with aggressive symptomatic and supportive therapy, with one dog dying during treatment. CONCLUSION: Dogs with canine stress syndrome have the potential for rapid recovery if treated aggressively and the complications of the disease (eg, coagulopathy) are anticipated. All four dogs were male, suggesting the possibility of a recessive sex-linked mode of inheritance. Further genetic analyses should be strongly considered by those involved with the English springer spaniel breed, either with a genome-wide association study using canine single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays or whole-genome sequencing of affected and closely related dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barros, P S M</author><author>Angelotti, A C</author><author>Nobre, F</author><author>Morales, A</author><author>Fantoni, D T</author><author>Barros, S B M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antioxidant profile of cataractous English Cocker Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>83-86</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>11397247</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1463-5224.1999.00056.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cataracts have been attributed to oxidative injury in proteins and lipids.  Primary defenses that directly protect the lens against oxidative damage include small molecule antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, glutathione and carotenoids) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the glutathione enzyme systems - glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). In humans, low plasmatic levels of vitamin C, vitamin E and carotenoids have been associated with a high risk of senile cataracts. Dogs are more prone to develop cataracts. A decrease in antioxidant defenses could be responsible for increased lens oxidation and cataract development. In this study we report the levels of erythrocytic enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and plasma vitamin C as well as malondialdehyde, in normal and cataractous English Cocker Spaniel dogs. Plasma vitamin C levels were consistently lower in cataractous dogs (20.17 &amp;mgr;M +/- 8.2 &amp;mgr;M) when compared with normal dogs (24.1 &amp;mgr;M +/- 9.4 &amp;mgr;M). These results indicate a possibly decreased synthesis in vitamin C, leading to lower aqueous humor levels of this vitamin. Considering that vitamin C levels in the aqueous humor may be responsible for lens antioxidant maintenance, and that these levels are obtained from plasma secretion through the ciliary epithelium, decreased plasma levels may indicate a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of the aqueous humor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driver, C J</author><author>Chandler, K</author><author>Walmsley, G</author><author>Shihab, N</author><author>Volk, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The association between Chiari-like malformation, ventriculomegaly and seizures  in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>235-237</pages><volume>195</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hydrocephalus</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Seizures</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>22749114</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.05.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) with Chiari-like malformation (CM) and  associated seizures are frequently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. There could be an association between ventriculomegaly (V) or caudal fossa overcrowding (CCFP) and seizures. A retrospective case-control study was performed using MRI to investigate the possible association between these morphological abnormalities and seizures. Seizure semiology and, where possible, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities were documented. Eighty-five CKCS with CM were included, 27 with seizures. There was no association between V or CCFP and seizures (P=0.10 and 0.71, respectively). Seizures were classified as having partial onset in 61% of individuals in the study population (95% CI 42.41-76.43%). Another cause of recurrent seizures in CKCS (such as familial epilepsy) is suspected, as previously reported.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lewis, Tom</author><author>Swift, Simon</author><author>Woolliams, John A</author><author>Blott, Sarah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heritability of premature mitral valve disease in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>73-76</pages><volume>188</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Heart Auscultation</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20347358</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.02.016</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Mixed model analysis of 1252 records of cardiac auscultation of 4- to 5-year-old  Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) from 1991 to 2008 in conjunction with the Kennel Club pedigree records of all dogs registered from the mid 1980s to September 2007 was used to estimate variance parameters of premature mitral valve disease (MVD). Data were limited to dogs ≥4 and &lt;5 years of age to ensure diagnostic distinction between early and late onset MVD. Cardiac murmurs were detected in 108/1252 (8.6%) dogs. Heritability estimates of 0.67 (standard error, SE 0.071) for the grade of murmur and 0.33 (SE 0.072) for the presence/absence of murmur were calculated. The variance due to clinician was 0.02 (SE 0.012) for grade and 0.03 (SE 0.017) for presence/absence of murmur. These results indicate that the presence and severity of MVD, as assessed by cardiac auscultation, in 4- to 5-year-old CKCS is highly heritable and that selection against the disease should be successful.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spiteri, Michaela</author><author>Knowler, Susan P</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Wells, Kevin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using machine learning to understand neuromorphological change and image-based  biomarker identification in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like malformation-associated pain and syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2665-2674</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Area Under Curve</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>ROC Curve</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31552689</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15621</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chiari-like malformation (CM) is a complex malformation of the skull  and cranial cervical vertebrae that potentially results in pain and secondary syringomyelia (SM). Chiari-like malformation-associated pain (CM-P) can be challenging to diagnose. We propose a machine learning approach to characterize morphological changes in dogs that may or may not be apparent to human observers. This data-driven approach can remove potential bias (or blindness) that may be produced by a hypothesis-driven expert observer approach. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To understand neuromorphological change and to identify image-based biomarkers in dogs with CM-P and symptomatic SM (SM-S) using a novel machine learning approach, with the aim of increasing the understanding of these disorders. ANIMALS: Thirty-two client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs; 11 controls, 10 CM-P, 11 SM-S). METHODS: Retrospective study using T2-weighted midsagittal Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) anonymized images, which then were mapped to images of an average clinically normal CKCS reference using Demons image registration. Key deformation features were automatically selected from the resulting deformation maps. A kernelized support vector machine was used for classifying characteristic localized changes in morphology. RESULTS: Candidate biomarkers were identified with receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (sensitivity 82%; specificity 69%) for the CM-P biomarkers collectively and an AUC of 0.82 (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 67%) for the SM-S biomarkers, collectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Machine learning techniques can assist CM/SM diagnosis and facilitate understanding of abnormal morphology location with the potential to be applied to a variety of breeds and conformational diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, Sofia</author><author>Olby, Natasha J</author><author>McCullough, Susan</author><author>Pease, Anthony P</author><author>Broadstone, Richard</author><author>Osborne, Jason A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphology of the caudal fossa in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>37-46</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Axial Joint</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Occipital Joint</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19241752</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2008.01487.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari malformations and syringohydromyelia are an important disease complex in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Although abnormalities in caudal fossa morphology are considered major contributors to the development of this disease, limited information exists on the range of morphologies in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and on the relationship of these to clinically evident disease. Sixty-four Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were studied. Each underwent a neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and brain. T2-weighted sagittal images were used to determine both the morphologic characteristics and volume of the caudal fossa in each dog. This volume was also analyzed as a percentage of total cranial cavity volume. Each attribute was correlated with neurological grade and presence of syringohydromyelia. Fifteen dogs had neurologic signs, and 59 had morphologic abnormalities of the craniocervical junction. While 27 dogs had syringohydromyelia, 13 of these were clinically normal. Cerebellar herniation and occipital dysplasia were common findings but were not associated with syringohydromyelia. Dorsal compressive lesions were noted at the first and second cervical vertebral junction. Factors associated with the presence of neurologic signs included syringohydromyelia and the ratio of caudal fossa/total cranial cavity volume; dogs with signs had significantly larger syringohydromyelia than asymptomatic dogs. Caudal fossa size was not associated with syringohydromyelia. A positive association was identified between foramen magnum size and length of cerebellar herniation. The prevalence of craniocervical junction abnormalities is high in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. While several factors are associated with neurologic signs, occipital hypoplasia appears to be the most important factor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tong, Linda J</author><author>Hosgood, Giselle L</author><author>French, Anne T</author><author>Irwin, Peter J</author><author>Shiel, Robert E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platelet function and activation in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with  subclinical chronic valvular heart disease.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>860-868</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Platelet Function Tests</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27463549</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.77.8.860</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE To assess platelet closure time (CT), mean platelet component (MPC)  concentration, and platelet component distribution width (PCDW) in dogs with subclinical chronic valvular heart disease. ANIMALS 89 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and 39 control dogs (not CKCSs). PROCEDURES Platelet count, MPC concentration, PCDW, and Hct were measured by use of a hematology analyzer, and CT was measured by use of a platelet function analyzer. Murmur grade and echocardiographic variables (mitral valve regurgitant jet size relative to left atrial area, left atrial-to-aortic diameter ratio, and left ventricular internal dimensions) were recorded. Associations between explanatory variables (sex, age, murmur grade, echocardiographic variables, platelet count, and Hct) and outcomes (CT, MPC concentration, and PCDW) were examined by use of multivariate regression models. RESULTS A model with 5 variables best explained variation in CT (R(2), 0.74), with &gt; 60% of the variance of CT explained by mitral valve regurgitant jet size. The model of best fit to explain variation in MPC concentration included only platelet count (R(2), 0.24). The model of best fit to explain variation in PCDW included platelet count and sex (R(2), 0.25). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In this study, a significant effect of mitral valve regurgitant jet size on CT was consistent with platelet dysfunction. However, platelet activation, as assessed on the basis of the MPC concentration and PCDW, was not a feature of subclinical chronic valvular heart disease in CKCSs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, M J</author><author>Kramer, M</author><author>Ondreka, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of the relative occipital bone volume between Cavalier King Charles  spaniels with and without syringohydromyelia and French bulldogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>540-544</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Imaging, Three-Dimensional</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Organ Size</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22702890</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2012.01955.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Our aim was to determine the relative volume of the occipital bone of Cavalier  King Charles spaniels with and without syringohydromyelia and normal French bulldogs to reappraise the role of a possible insufficiency of the paraxial mesoderm in the pathogenesis of the caudal occipital malformation syndrome. Analysis of the occipital bone volume of 43 dogs based on computed tomography datasets was performed. Volume was determined by means of three-dimensional models. Using manual segmentation of the occipital bone in sagittal, transverse, and dorsal images, the volume of the occipital bone and the rest of the skull was calculated. The absolute occipital bone volume was put in relation to the total skull volume, the occipital bone index. For the Cavalier King Charles spaniels without syringomyelia, the median occipital bone index was 0.0681; for Cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia, it was 0.0646 and for French bulldogs, it was 0.0676. There was no global difference of the occipital bone index between examined groups (P = 0.4331). A reduced volume of the occipital bone was not found in Cavalier King Charles spaniels in general in comparison to French bulldogs, or in Cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia compared to Cavalier King Charles spaniels without syringomyelia. These results do not support occipital hypoplasia as a cause for syringomyelia development, challenging the paraxial mesoderm insufficiency theory. This also suggests that the term Chiari-like malformation, a term derived from human studies, is not appropriate in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burton, Neil J</author><author>Horsewill, Hannah</author><author>Sparks, Tim H</author><author>Caruso, Ilaria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design and topographic evaluation of a canine humeral anatomic plating system  (CHAPS) for humeral condylar fracture repair in spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>446-459</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Plates</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epiphyses</keyword><keyword>Fracture Fixation, Internal</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36056889</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vsu.13883</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To design a precontoured plating system for humeral condylar fracture  repair in spaniels with humeral intracondylar fissure (HIF) and quantify accuracy of fit of the system on 3D printed bone models. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental on 3D printed models. METHODS: The plating system was based on morphometric data obtained from CT. Plates were applied to models and impression material was measured under the plates at points of interest to define plate bone gap (PBG). Data on locking screw interference on plate application were also obtained. RESULTS: Eleven elbows models were plated. Statistical analysis to assess for any difference in PBG measurements between left and right humuri revealed two loci (3 and 17) under the lateral plate and two loci (3 and 17) under the medial plate. On cumulate portion analysis, 67% of lateral plate loci and 80% of medial plate loci had a PBG of ≤2 mm respectively. An incidence of 2.1% (3/143) screw interference occurred. CONCLUSION: Design of a contoured plating system for application to humeral models from spaniels with HIF and its application with objective measurement of PBG is described. The majority of the loci measured under both lateral and medial plates had a BPG of ≤2 mm and the incidence of locking screw interference on plate application was low. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This novel system may have application for the stabilization of humeral condylar fractures in spaniels avoiding the need for plate contouring and minimizing the incidence of locking screw interference.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Langley-Hobbs, Sorrel</author><author>Sargan, David</author><author>West, Victoria</author><author>Nicholson, Ian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>225</pages><volume>163</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Research</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18708662</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.163.7.225</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, M J</author><author>Neumann, A C</author><author>Amort, K H</author><author>Failing, K</author><author>Kramer, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cephalometric measurements and determination of general skull type of Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>436-440</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cephalometry</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Imaging, Three-Dimensional</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21521397</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2011.01825.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The general skull morphology of the head of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  (CKCS) was examined and compared with cephalometric indices of brachycephalic, mesaticephalic, and dolichocephalic heads. Measurements were taken from computed tomography images. Defined landmarks for linear measurements of were identified using three-dimensional (3D) models. The calculated parameters of the CKCS were different from all parameters of mesaticephalic dogs but were the same as parameters from brachycephalic dogs. However, the CKCS had a wider braincase in relation to length than in other brachycephalic breeds. Studies of the etiology of the chiari-like malformation in the CKCS should therefore focus on brachycephalic control groups. As Chari-like malformation has only been reported in brachycephalic breeds, its etiology could be associated with a higher grade of brachycephaly, meaning a shorter longitudinal extension of the skull. This has been suggested for other breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Podberscek, A L</author><author>Serpell, J A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aggressive behaviour in English cocker spaniels and the personality of their  owners.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>73-76</pages><volume>141</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Aggression</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Human-Animal Bond</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Personality</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9257436</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.141.3.73</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The aim of the study was to determine whether there is an association between the  personality of the owners of English cocker spaniels and the expression of aggressive behaviour by their dogs.

METHODS: The case records of 10 English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and pulsus alternans were reviewed. All dogs had been referred in moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Pulsus alternans was clinically recognised by palpation of a regular alternation of femoral pulse amplitude and confirmed by echocardiography in all cases. Pulsus alternans was an intermittent finding in all 10 dogs. RESULTS: Phonocardiographic recordings were obtained in three dogs to document variation in the intensity of the heart sounds, with one case exhibiting absence of the second heart sound in alternate beats. M-mode echocardiography performed in all dogs showed alternation of the pattern of mitral valve diastolic motion. Doppler echocardiography showed marked alternation in stroke volume in the aortic outflow in all cases. It also showed alternation in mitral regurgitation and in the velocity of early ventricular filling. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pulsus alternans may be more prevalent in English cocker spaniels than in other breeds, and because of its intermittent nature, its incidence may be higher than that previously reported. It has diagnostic relevance as it usually indicates severe myocardial depression. Echocardiography allows non-invasive detection of mechanical alternans and provides further insights into its pathophysiology and clinical significance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>176</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Bone Screws</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>7778259</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Summers, Jennifer F</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Thomson, Peter C</author><author>McGreevy, Paul D</author><author>Brodbelt, David C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of disorders recorded in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels attending  primary-care veterinary practices in England.</title><secondary-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>4</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26401332</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-015-0016-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised over breed-related health issues in  purebred dogs, but reliable prevalence estimates for disorders within specific breeds are sparse. Electronically stored patient health records from primary-care practice are emerging as a useful source of epidemiological data in companion animals. This study used large volumes of health data from UK primary-care practices participating in the VetCompass animal health surveillance project to evaluate in detail the disorders diagnosed in a random selection of over 50% of dogs recorded as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs). Confirmation of breed using available microchip and Kennel Club (KC) registration data was attempted. RESULTS: In total, 3624 dogs were recorded as CKCSs within the VetCompass database of which 143 (3.9%) were confirmed as KC-registered via microchip identification linkage of VetCompass to the KC database. 1875 dogs (75 KC registered and 1800 of unknown KC status, 52% of both groups) were randomly sampled for detailed clinical review. Clinical data associated with veterinary care were recorded in 1749 (93.3%) of these dogs. The most common specific disorders recorded during the study period were heart murmur (541 dogs, representing 30.9% of study group), diarrhoea of unspecified cause (193 dogs, 11.0%), dental disease (166 dogs, 9.5%), otitis externa (161, 9.2%), conjunctivitis (131, 7.4%) and anal sac infection (129, 7.4%). The five most common disorder categories were cardiac (affecting 31.7% of dogs), dermatological (22.2%), ocular (20.6%), gastrointestinal (19.3%) and dental/periodontal disorders (15.2%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that many of the disorders commonly affecting CKCSs are largely similar to those affecting the general dog population presented for primary veterinary care in the UK. However, cardiac disease (and MVD in particular) continues to be of particular concern in this breed. FURTHER WORK: This work highlights the value of veterinary practice based breed-specific epidemiological studies to provide targeted and evidence-based health policies. Further studies using electronic patient records in other breeds could highlight their potential disease predispositions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>New DNA tests for Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>370</pages><volume>168</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Carrier Screening</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21498257</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.d2224</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenn, Joe</author><author>Schmidt, Martin J</author><author>Simpson, Harriet</author><author>Driver, Colin J</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Venous sinus volume in the caudal cranial fossa in Cavalier King Charles spaniels  with syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>896-897</pages><volume>197</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure</keyword><keyword>Cranial Sinuses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23755937</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.05.007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Syringomyelia (SM) in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) has a complex  pathophysiology. Recent studies support a relationship between altered venous drainage and cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between venous sinus and parenchymal volume within the caudal cranial fossa (CCF) in CKCS with SM (n=22) and without SM (n=12) using magnetic resonance venography (MRV). MRI and MRV images were used to obtain volumetric calculations of CCF volume, as well as the percentage of this volume occupied by parenchyma (CCFP%) and venous sinuses (CCFV%). In CKCS with SM, CCFP% was significantly higher (P&lt;0.001), whilst CCFV% was significantly lower (P=0.001) than in CKCS without SM. These results support a role for reduced venous drainage and parenchymal 'overcrowding' of the CCF in the pathophysiology of SM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Martin Jürgen</author><author>Ondreka, Nele</author><author>Sauerbrey, Maren</author><author>Volk, Holger Andreas</author><author>Rummel, Christoph</author><author>Kramer, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Volume reduction of the jugular foramina in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with  syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>158</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Constriction, Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22954070</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1746-6148-8-158</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Understanding the pathogenesis of the chiari-like malformation in the  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is incomplete, and current hypotheses do not fully explain the development of syringomyelia (SM) in the spinal cords of affected dogs. This study investigates an unconventional pathogenetic theory for the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure waves in the subarachnoid space in CKCS with SM, by analogy with human diseases. In children with achondroplasia the shortening of the skull base can lead to a narrowing of the jugular foramina (JF) between the cranial base synchondroses. This in turn has been reported to cause a congestion of the major venous outflow tracts of the skull and consequently to an increase in the intracranial pressure (ICP). Amongst brachycephalic dog breeds the CKCS has been identified as having an extremely short and wide braincase. A stenosis of the JF and a consequential vascular compromise in this opening could contribute to venous hypertension, raising ICP and causing CSF jets in the spinal subarachnoid space of the CKCS. In this study, JF volumes in CKCSs with and without SM were compared to assess a possible role of this pathologic mechanism in the development of SM in this breed. RESULTS: Computed tomography (CT) scans of 40 CKCSs &gt; 4 years of age were used to create three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and the JF. Weight matched groups (7-10 kg) of 20 CKCSs with SM and 20 CKCSs without SM were compared. CKCSs without SM presented significantly larger JF -volumes (median left JF: 0.0633 cm3; median right JF: 0.0703 cm3; p &lt; 0.0001) when compared with CKCSs with SM (median left JF: 0.0382 cm3; median right JF: 0.0434 cm3; p &lt; 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the left and right JF within each group. Bland-Altman analysis revealed excellent reproducibility of all volume measurements. CONCLUSION: A stenosis of the JF and consecutive venous congestion may explain the aetiology of CSF pressure waves in the subarachnoid space, independent of cerebellar herniation, as an additional pathogenetic factor for the development of SM in this breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sparks, C R</author><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, S</author><author>Griffith, E H</author><author>Lascelles, B D X</author><author>Olby, N J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Questionnaire-based Analysis of Owner-reported Scratching and Pain Signs in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels Screened for Chiari-like Malformation and Syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>331-339</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuroimaging</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Pruritus</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29105875</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14856</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) cause a pain  syndrome in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). Clinical signs are not consistently apparent on neurologic examination, and owner reporting of signs provides vital clinical history. However, owner questionnaires for this disease are not well developed. OBJECTIVES: To develop a tool to capture owner-reported clinical signs for use in clinical trials and to compare owner-reported signs with the presence of pain on neurologic examination and SM on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ANIMALS: Fifty client-owned CKCS. METHODS: Owners completed a questionnaire and pain/scratch map. Each dog underwent a neurologic examination and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Questionnaire responses were developed into scores, area of shading for pain/scratch maps was measured, and consistency of responses between these tools was assessed. Owner-reported findings were compared with neurologic examination findings and presence and severity of SM on MRI. RESULTS: Thirty-three dogs were symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic; 30 had SM. The most common sign of pain was crying out when lifted (n = 11). Extent of shaded areas on maps positively correlated with questionnaire scores for pain (r(2)  = 0.213, P = 0.006) and scratch (r(2)  = 0.104, P = 0.089). Owner-reported findings were not significantly associated with presence or severity of SM or neurologic examination findings. Owner-reported lateralization of signs was significantly associated with SM lateralization (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire and maps may be useful for clinical trials. Lack of association of owner-reported signs with SM highlights our lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of pain in this disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ancot, Frédéric</author><author>Lemay, Philippe</author><author>Knowler, Susan P</author><author>Kennedy, Karen</author><author>Griffiths, Sandra</author><author>Cherubini, Giunio Bruto</author><author>Sykes, Jane</author><author>Mandigers, Paul J J</author><author>Rouleau, Guy A</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Kibar, Zoha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A genome-wide association study identifies candidate loci associated to  syringomyelia secondary to Chiari-like malformation in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>BMC genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>16</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Loci</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29566674</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12863-018-0605-z</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia (SM) is a common condition affecting brachycephalic toy  breed dogs and is characterized by the development of fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord. It is often concurrent with a complex developmental malformation of the skull and craniocervical vertebrae called Chiari-like malformation (CM) characterized by a conformational change and overcrowding of the brain and cervical spinal cord particularly at the craniocervical junction. CM and SM have a polygenic mode of inheritance with variable penetrance. RESULTS: We identified six cranial T1-weighted sagittal MRI measurements that were associated to maximum transverse diameter of the syrinx cavity. Increased syrinx transverse diameter has been correlated previously with increased likelihood of behavioral signs of pain. We next conducted a whole genome association study of these traits in 65 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs (33 controls, 32 with extreme phenotypes). Two loci on CFA22 and CFA26 were found to be significantly associated to two traits associated with a reduced volume and altered orientation of the caudal cranial fossa. Their reconstructed haplotypes defined two associated regions that harbor only two genes: PCDH17 on CFA22 and ZWINT on CFA26. PCDH17 codes for a cell adhesion molecule expressed specifically in the brain and spinal cord. ZWINT plays a role in chromosome segregation and its expression is increased with the onset of neuropathic pain. Targeted genomic sequencing of these regions identified respectively 37 and 339 SNPs with significantly associated P values. Genotyping of tagSNPs selected from these 2 candidate loci in an extended cohort of 461 CKCS (187 unaffected, 274 SM affected) identified 2 SNPs on CFA22 that were significantly associated to SM strengthening the candidacy of this locus in SM development. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 loci on CFA22 and CFA26 that contained only 2 genes, PCDH17 and ZWINT, significantly associated to two traits associated with syrinx transverse diameter. The locus on CFA22 was significantly associated to SM secondary to CM in the CKCS dog breed strengthening its candidacy for this disease. This study will provide an entry point for identification of the genetic factors predisposing to this condition and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polton, Gerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examining the heritability of anal sac gland carcinoma in cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>57</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Gland Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Research</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19161510</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2008.00717.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hechler, Ashley C</author><author>Moore, Sarah A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Understanding and Treating Chiari-like Malformation and Syringomyelia in Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Pain Management</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29793722</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.tcam.2018.03.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) are common and debilitating  conditions in toy and small breed dogs. CM, considered ubiquitous in the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) population, results in abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics which can lead to the development of SM. The clinical signs associated with CM/SM are frequently confused with other otologic and dermatologic conditions, which may delay appropriate treatment. A definitive diagnosis of CM/SM requires advanced imaging; however, due to expense associated with this, many cases are managed presumptively and symptomatically for the condition. The primary goal of treatment is to manage neuropathic pain and neurologic deficits through pharmaceutical or surgical approaches. Current literature suggests that most CM/SM-affected dogs have progression of their clinical signs in spite of medical or surgical management; however, most maintain a good quality of life based on owner assessments. Lack of correlation between structural markers of disease and clinician and owner-derived measures of neuropathic pain highlight the need for more robust, quantitative measures of pain in this common veterinary disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, G M</author><author>Friend, E J</author><author>Jeffery, N D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship between pharyngeal conformation and otitis media with effusion in  Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>55-58</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eustachian Tube</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Nasopharynx</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Palate, Soft</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20622204</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.b4886</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common incidental finding in otherwise  normal Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate influence of breed, age, sex, body weight, degree of recording artifact, and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) on Holter recordings of 3 breeds of small dogs that have differing predispositions for myxomatous mitral valve disease. The study also assessed if heart rate (HR) at clinical examination (HRex) was associated with HR during Holter monitoring and evaluated the reproducibility of Holter variables. ANIMALS: Fifty clinically healthy, privately owned dogs of the breeds Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS), Wire-haired Dachshund (wD), or Cairn Terrier (CT). METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal observational study. Dogs were recruited for clinical examination, echocardiography, and Holter monitoring. In 8 CKCS, Holter recordings were performed twice with a 7-day interval. Arrhythmia and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis (time and frequency domain analysis) were performed on Holter recordings. RESULTS: Fifteen out of 27 Holter derived variables were significantly associated with breed (P &lt; .03), but not with age (P &gt; .7), sex (P &gt; .2), body weight (P &gt; .7), degree of recording artifact (P &gt; .4), or MVP (P &gt; .6). During Holter recording, minimum (P = .0001) and mean HR (P = .0001) were higher in CKCS compared with wD. CKCS had significantly lower values than wD, CT, or both in 10 out of 13 HRV variables (P &lt; .03). Minimum and mean HR during Holter recording were correlated with HRex (r = 0.55, P = .0003). HR and time domain variables had a coefficient of variation &lt;10%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There is an influence of breed on Holter-derived variables in 3 breeds of small dogs. Arrhythmia and HRV analysis can be performed on 24-hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) recordings. Arrhythmia analysis includes HR measurements and identification of arrhythmias.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driver, C J</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>McGonnell, I M</author><author>Volk, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphometric assessment of cranial volumes in age-matched Cavalier King Charles  spaniels with and without syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>978-979</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>25</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hydrocephalus</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>21262715</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.c4109</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Carruthers, H</author><author>Dubé, M-P</author><author>Holmes, M</author><author>Jeffery, N D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels: the relationship between syrinx  dimensions and pain.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>432-436</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Pain Measurement</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Compression</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17608656</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00344.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test the hypothesis that pain associated  with syringomyelia in dogs is dependent upon size and involvement of the dorsal part of the spinal cord. METHODS: Masked observers determined syrinx dimensions and precise location within the spinal cord on magnetic resonance images of 55 cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia. After removal of masking, syrinx size and location were compared between the cohorts of dogs that exhibited pain with those that did not. RESULTS: Maximum syrinx width was the strongest predictor of pain, scratching behaviour and scoliosis in dogs with syringomyelia. Both pain and syrinx size were positively correlated with syrinxes located in the dorsal half of the spinal cord. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Large syrinxes associated with damage to the dorsal part of the spinal cord are associated with persistent pain suggesting that the pain behaviour expressed by this group of patients is likely to be &quot;neuropathic pain,&quot; resulting from disordered neural processing in the damaged dorsal horn. As such it is likely that conventional analgesic medication may be ineffective.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moores, A P</author><author>Agthe, P</author><author>Schaafsma, I A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle and other  abnormalities of the elbow in English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>211-216</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Joint Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Osteogenesis</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22286098</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3415/VCOT-11-05-0066</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of incomplete ossification of the humeral  condyle (IOHC) and other osseous abnormalities of the elbow in English Springer Spaniels with no history of lameness. METHODS: Prospective observational study of English Springer Spaniels with no recent history of lameness. Computed tomography scans of both elbows were obtained from dogs older than six months of age which were anaesthetized or sedated for reasons unrelated to this study. Computed tomography scans were reviewed for the presence of IOHC and other abnormalities of the elbow. Radioulnar incongruity (RUI) measurements from normal elbows were compared to elbows with IOHC and elbows with medial coronoid process (MCP) abnormalities. RESULTS: Computed tomography scans from 50 dogs (100 elbows) were reviewed. The prevalence of IOHC was 14% (8 elbows in 7 dogs). All condylar fissures were incomplete with a mean length of 2.6 mm. Fifty percent of the dogs (44% of elbows) had abnormalities of the medial coronoid process and 60% of the elbows had periarticular osteophytes. Group RUI meansurements for IOHC and MCP were not significantly different from normal elbows. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Small IOHC fissures, periarticular osteophytes and MCP abnormalities may be identified in English Springer Spaniels without forelimb lameness. Abnormalities of the MCP are more common than IOHC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, Sofia</author><author>Olby, Natasha J</author><author>Broadstone, Richard</author><author>McCullough, Susan</author><author>Osborne, Jason A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid flow in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  analyzed using phase velocity cine magnetic resonance imaging.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>467-476</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cerebrospinal Fluid</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19788029</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01571.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Syringomyelia is an important morbidity source in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.  Although abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow secondary to Chiari malformations is thought to cause syringomyelia in humans, this relationship is unknown in dogs. We used phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to evaluate CSF flow in dogs. Fifty-nine Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were assigned a neurologic grade reflecting their neurologic status. Five normal control dogs of other breeding were imaged for comparison. The presence of syringomyelia was noted from sagittal MR images. The pattern and velocity of CSF flow were assessed using phase-contrast cine MRI at the foramen magnum, C2-C3 disc space, and within syrinxes. Flow was measured most easily with the neck flexed to mimic standing. CSF flow velocity in the dorsal aspect of the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum was significantly higher in control dogs than Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (P = 0.035). Flow was obstructed at the foramen magnum in 41 of 59 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Turbulent flow and jets were associated with syringomyelia presence and severity, and CSF flow velocity at C2/3 dorsally was inversely related to the presence of syringomyelia (P = 0.0197). Peak dorsal subarachnoid space CSF flow velocity at the foramen magnum and C2-C3 were together highly predictive of syringomyelia. CSF flow can be assessed in dogs using phase-contrast cine MRI. Obstruction to flow at the foramen magnum is common in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and CSF flow pattern and velocity are related to the presence of syringomyelia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jacinto, A M L</author><author>Mellanby, R J</author><author>Chandler, M</author><author>Bommer, N X</author><author>Carruthers, H</author><author>Fairbanks, L D</author><author>Gow, A G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urine concentrations of xanthine, hypoxanthine and uric acid in UK Cavalier King  Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>395-398</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypoxanthine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Uric Acid</keyword><keyword>Urolithiasis</keyword><keyword>Xanthine</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23859747</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12106</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Xanthine urolithiasis and asymptomatic xanthinuria have been  diagnosed in Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs suggesting that primary xanthinuria may be a breed-related disorder, although its prevalence remains unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that asymptomatic xanthinuria is common in Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs. METHODS: Free catch urine samples were collected from 35 client-owned Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs and from 24 dogs of other breeds. The purine metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The urine ratios of xanthine/creatinine and hypoxanthine/creatinine were calculated and compared between the two groups of dogs. RESULTS: The urine concentrations of purine metabolites were not significantly different between the two groups and were very low in both. The urine concentrations of xanthine in all 35 Cavalier King Charles spaniel were markedly lower than in the previously reported case of xanthine urolithiasis in a UK Cavalier King Charles spaniel dog. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Asymptomatic xanthinuria was not detected in this UK Cavalier King Charles spaniel population. This data may be used as a reference for urinary purine metabolite concentrations in the dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Upchurch, J J</author><author>McGonnell, I M</author><author>Driver, C J</author><author>Butler, L</author><author>Volk, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of head positioning on the assessment of Chiari-like malformation in  Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>277</pages><volume>169</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cerebrospinal Fluid</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21824898</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.d4395</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CM) is almost omnipresent in the Cavalier King Charles  spaniels (CKCS), often leading to syringomyelia (SM). Morphometric studies have produced variable results concerning relationship between the brain parenchyma within the caudal cranial fossa (CCF) and SM. The present study assesses the effect of head position, one potential confounder. Magnetic resonance images of CKCS with CM were reviewed in extended and flexed head positions. Volumes were calculated from transverse T2-weighted brain images. Mid-sagittal images were used for measurement of cerebellar herniation and CSF space between cerebellum and brainstem. Fourteen CKCS were included into the study, seven dogs with CM and seven with CM/SM. There was no difference between the relative brain parenchyma within the CCF in extended position and flexed position, or the brain parenchyma within the rostral and middle cranial fossae proportion. Cerebellar herniation and CSF space between cerebellum and brainstem were significantly increased in the flexed position. Cerebellar herniation and CSF space differed significantly between CM and CM/SM in a flexed head position. Volumetric measurements did not vary with head position. Cerebellar herniation and CSF space between the cerebellum and the brainstem were larger in a flexed head position.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, W R</author><author>Clague, A E</author><author>Barns, R J</author><author>Bate, M J</author><author>MacKay, B M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine alpha-L-fucosidosis: a storage disease of Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Acta neuropathologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta neuropathologica</full-title></periodical><pages>9-13</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fucose</keyword><keyword>Ganglia, Spinal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Vacuoles</keyword><keyword>Vagus Nerve</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year></dates><accession-num>6880626</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00685341</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progressive ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, dysphagia and wasting occurred in a  female and a male from the same litter of Springer Spaniels after the age of 12 and 19 months. At autopsy both showed marked enlargement of cranial parts of vagus and cervical nerves and dorsal root ganglia, and there was widespread vacuolation of cells of central nervous system (CNS), some peripheral nerves and of epithelial and mesenchymal cells of many organs; these vacuoles were largely empty in histological material, and were assumed to be of lysosomal origin after electron-microscopic study. Cultured fibroblasts and peripheral blood leucocytes from the male were shown to be severely deficient in alpha-L-fucosidase, and the mother of these cases was found to have less than half the expected activity of this enzyme in blood leucocytes.

The pathogenesis of SM secondary to Chiari-like malformation (CM) has been the focus of intense research in recent years. The gulf in our understanding of CM/SM in dogs relative to the analogous human condition has progressively narrowed. CM is primarily a disease of abnormal geometric morphometry affecting the caudal cranial fossa and the brain parenchyma contained within it. This review describes how advanced imaging techniques have revealed a series of morphometric abnormalities associated with CM/SM. The series is presented in a logical order to help describe the pathogenesis of CM and the subsequent formation of syringes, with particular reference to the concepts of craniospinal compliance and cerebrospinal fluid pulse pressure timing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reisner, Ilana R</author><author>Houpt, Katherine A</author><author>Shofer, Frances S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>National survey of owner-directed aggression in English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1594-1603</pages><volume>227</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Aggression</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Personality</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Sterilization, Reproductive</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16313036</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2005.227.1594</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of owner-directed aggression and identify  associated environmental and genetic factors in English Springer Spaniels. DESIGN: Prevalence survey. ANIMALS: 1,053 adult English Springer Spaniels. PROCEDURE: A mail survey was sent to 2,400 randomly selected owners of adult American Kennel Club-registered English Springer Spaniels. Dogs with a history of aggression to family members and familiar humans were compared with dogs without such a history. RESULTS: 1,053 questionnaires (56.1% of the 1,877 delivered) were completed. A history of owner-directed growling or more intense aggression was reported in 510 (48.4%) dogs. Two hundred seventy-seven (26.3%) dogs had bitten a human in the past; 65.2% of bites were directed at familiar (owner or nonowner) adults and children. Variables associated with owner-directed aggression included sex of dog (male), neuter status (neutered, regardless of sex), show or bench lines, age &gt; 4 years, aggression to unfamiliar adults and children, acquisition from a hobby breeder, less responsiveness to obedience cues, and a specific kennel and 1 popular sire from that kennel in a 4-generation pedigree. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Owner-directed aggression in adult English Springer Spaniels was associated with a number of environmental, sex-related, and inherited factors. To reduce the risk of aggression, prospective owners might seek a female, hunting-type English Springer Spaniel from an experienced breeder. However, because risk factors are broad and varied, there are limitations to the extent to which behavior can be predicted and further study is needed of the inheritance of aggression in this breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buchanan, J W</author><author>Beardow, A W</author><author>Sammarco, C D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Femoral artery occlusion in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>872-874</pages><volume>211</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arterial Occlusive Diseases</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Femoral Artery</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Pulse</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9333089</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To investigate development of femoral artery occlusion in Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels. DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 954 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. PROCEDURE: 1,750 cardiovascular examinations consisting of visual inspection of mucous membranes, thoracic auscultation in areas associated with the heart valves, thoracic palpation, and palpation of the femoral arteries were made at 10 dog shows on 954 dogs. Findings of clinically normal, weak, or undetectable femoral pulses were recorded. Pathologic changes in occluded femoral arteries of 2 dogs were examined histologically. RESULTS: Of the 954 dogs, 22 (2.3%) had an undetectable right or left femoral pulse on 1 or more examinations. Forty (4.2%) additional dogs had weak unilateral or bilateral femoral pulses. Only 1 dog had exercise intolerance, and it had coexistent congestive heart failure. Histologic examination of serial sections of an occluded femoral artery from 1 dog revealed intimal thickening with breaks in the internal elastic lamina proximal to the occluded segment. The occluded segment of the femoral artery was contracted and filled with an organizing, recanalizing thrombus. Similar histopathologic changes were found in sections of a femoral artery from another dog. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Femoral artery occlusion is rare in other breeds and is not clinically important in dogs because of adequate collateral circulation; however, its rather common development in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels indicates a genetic predisposition and probable weakness in the femoral artery wall.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, P J</author><author>Wotton, P</author><author>Eastwood, J</author><author>Swift, S T</author><author>Jones, B</author><author>Day, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunoglobulin deficiency in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Pneumocystis  pneumonia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>523-527</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulins</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16734084</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2006)20[523:idickc]2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA were measured in 9  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis sp that were examined at 4 veterinary surgeries in the United Kingdom (UK) between September 2001 and November 2002. Pneumocystis pneumonia was confirmed in all dogs by visualization of the organism in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or a transthoracic lung aspirate. Two dogs had a history of demodicosis. Immunoglobulin concentrations also were measured in breed-and age-matched dogs sampled over the same period. IgG concentrations were significantly (P = .000) lower in the affected dogs (median 3.2 mg/mL) than in the control dogs (median 8.5 mg/mL). IgM concentrations were significantly (P = .002) higher in the affected dogs (median 1.95 mg/mL) than in the control dogs (median 1.12 mg/mL). One affected dog had no change in IgG concentration more than 3 months after resolution of infection or vaccination, but did have reduction in IgM concentration after resolution of infection and vaccination. Control dogs had low serum IgG and IgM concentrations, compared with the reference interval for all dogs. Lymphocyte count in blood was normal or high in 7 of 8 affected dogs. The results of this study suggest that there is a defect in immunity in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels that underlies the susceptibility of these dogs to pneumocystosis. Further studies are indicated to elucidate the mechanisms behind the defect, the prevalence within the breed, and the potential mode of inheritance of the problem.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Loderstedt, Shenja</author><author>Benigni, Livia</author><author>Chandler, Kate</author><author>Cardwell, Jacqueline M</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Lamb, Christopher R</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution of syringomyelia along the entire spinal cord in clinically affected  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>359-363</pages><volume>190</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21216639</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.12.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) is an important disease  complex in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) but data about the anatomical distribution of SM along the spinal cord are lacking in veterinary medicine. The objective of this study was to define the anatomic distribution of SM in CKCS clinically affected by CM/SM. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and the entire spinal cord of 49 dogs was performed and different morphological parameters compared. Syrinx formation was present in the C1-C4 region and in other parts of the spinal cord. The maximal dorsoventral syrinx size can occur in any region of the spinal cord and the total syrinx size was positively correlated with age. Seventy-six per cent of CKCS with a cranial cervical syrinx also have a syrinx affecting more caudal spinal cord regions. MRI restricted to the cervical region may underestimate the extent of SM and the severity of the disease process in the majority of dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary secretory otitis media in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>222; author reply 222</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15116893</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ives, E J</author><author>Doyle, L</author><author>Holmes, M</author><author>Williams, T L</author><author>Vanhaesebrouck, A E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association between the findings on magnetic resonance imaging screening for  syringomyelia in asymptomatic Cavalier King Charles spaniels and observation of clinical signs consistent with syringomyelia in later life.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>129-130</pages><volume>203</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25475164</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.11.010</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A questionnaire-based study was used to investigate the association between the  findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening for syringomyelia (SM) in 79 asymptomatic Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) and the subsequent development of clinical signs consistent with SM in later life.

Whether the findings of MRI screening can be used to indicate the likelihood of an asymptomatic CKCS developing clinical signs consistent with SM in later life warrants further prospective study in a larger cohort of dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Xiaolin</author><author>Hu, Jin</author><author>Zhang, Hanying</author><author>Xu, Yinxue</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic Variants in the STMN1 Transcriptional Regulatory Region Affect Promoter  Activity and Fear Behavior in English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0158756</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fear</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional</keyword><keyword>Stathmin</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27390866</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0158756</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a neuronal growth-associated protein that is involved in  microtubule dynamics and plays an important role in synaptic outgrowth and plasticity. Given that STMN1 affects fear behavior, we hypothesized that genetic variations in the STMN1 transcriptional regulatory region affect gene transcription activity and control fear behavior. In this study, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), g. -327 A&gt;G and g. -125 C&gt;T, were identified in 317 English Springer Spaniels. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that both were loci located in the canine STMN1 putative promoter region and affected transcription factor binding. A statistical analysis revealed that the TT genotype at g.-125 C&gt;T produced a significantly greater fear level than that of the CC genotype (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the H4H4 (GTGT) haplotype combination was significantly associated with canine fear behavior (P &lt; 0.01). Using serially truncated constructs of the STMN1 promoters and the luciferase reporter, we found that a 395 bp (-312 nt to +83 nt) fragment constituted the core promoter region. The luciferase assay also revealed that the H4 (GT) haplotype promoter had higher activity than that of other haplotypes. Overall, our results suggest that the two SNPs in the canine STMN1 promoter region could affect canine fear behavior by altering STMN1 transcriptional activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smedile, L E</author><author>Houston, D M</author><author>Taylor, S M</author><author>Post, K</author><author>Searcy, G P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Idiopathic, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in Cavalier King Charles spaniels: 11  cases (1983-1993).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>411-415</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prednisone</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9278116</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-33-5-411</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The medical records of 11 Cavalier King Charles spaniels with idiopathic,  asymptomatic thrombocytopenia and large-to-giant platelets were identified from a 10-year retrospective search using the Veterinary Medical Data Base at Purdue University.

Three Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) skulls were examined and radiographed during the course of a separate study and all demonstrated changes consistent with bilateral temporomandibular joint dysplasia. Subsequently, skull radiographs from all CKCS dogs examined at the University of Glasgow Veterinary School between 1991 and 2001 were reviewed (n = 26). Only two of these dogs were radiographed specifically for investigation of the temporomandibular joint, although varying degrees of dysplasia were identified in all dogs where the joints were adequately visualized (n = 20). The head of four CKCS cadavers was also radiographed, and similar changes were found. This finding suggests that temporomandibular joint dysplasia is a widespread asymptomatic condition in the CKCS and should be regarded as a normal morphologic variation rather than a pathologic anomaly. Subtle changes are best seen on lateral oblique radiographs, although marked changes are also visible on dorsoventral views. The rotational angle or angle of articulation of each of the dysplastic mandibular condyles was measured and was related to the severity of the dysplastic changes. However, there was overlap between the values calculated for these abnormal joints and normal ones in other breeds, suggesting this measurement was of limited significance and the shape of the components of the temporomandibular joint are more relevant when assessing this joint for the presence of dysplastic changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scott, D W</author><author>Miller, W H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary seborrhoea in English springer spaniels: a retrospective study of 14  cases.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>173-178</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Seborrheic</keyword><keyword>Dietary Fats</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Keratolytic Agents</keyword><keyword>Keratosis, Seborrheic</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8731404</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.1996.tb01955.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Primary seborrhoea was diagnosed in 14 English springer spaniels over a 17-year  period. Seven of the dogs developed clinical signs by two years of age. The dermatosis began as a generalised non-pruritic dry scaling which gradually worsened. Some dogs remained in this dry (seborrhoea sicca) stage, but in most cases the dermatosis became greasy and inflamed (seborrhoea oleosa and seborrhoeic dermatitis). Eight of the dogs suffered from recurrent episodes of superficial or deep bacterial pyoderma. Histological findings in skin biopsy specimens included marked orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis of surface and infundibular epithelium, papillomatosis, parakeratotic capping of the papillae, and superficial perivascular dermatitis in which lymphocytes and mast cells were prominent. The dogs with seborrhoea sicca responded more satisfactorily to therapy with topical emollient-humectant agents or oral omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid supplementation. Dogs with seborrhoea oleosa and seborrhoeic dermatitis did not respond satisfactorily to topical therapy. One dog, however, responded well to etretinate and omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid administration.

The IDEXX VetAutoread hematology analyzer, which performs quantitative buffy coat (QBC) analysis, has been validated to determine platelet mass in CKCS dogs. The Advia 2120 reports a PCT, but the validity of this value has not been evaluated for dogs with macrothrombocytopenia. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to validate MPV and PCT determined by the Advia 2120 in dogs, including CKCS dogs, comparing values with those obtained from QBC analysis. METHODS: Advia PCT was compared with QBC results from 43 CKCS dogs and 15 dogs of other breeds in one study. Advia PCT, platelet count, and MPV were evaluated to identify biologic patterns in 31 clinically healthy CKCS dogs and 66 dogs of 3 other breeds and to generate values used for comparisons. RESULTS: Advia PCT agreed well with QBC results in general, but had a negative bias and appeared to underestimate PCT in CKCS dogs with the lowest PCTs. Advia PCT and MPV results followed expected biologic patterns in CKCS dogs and dogs of other breeds with MPVs being highest in dogs with the lowest platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: Advia 2120 PCT and MPV satisfactorily identified changes in platelet mass and size in CKCS dogs, but PCTs were lower than expected, especially in CKCS dogs with the lowest PCTs, when compared with QBC results.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelley, Jessica</author><author>Sharkey, Leslie C</author><author>Christopherson, Pete W</author><author>Rendahl, Aaron</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platelet count and plateletcrit in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Greyhounds  using the Advia 120 and 2120.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>43-49</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mean Platelet Volume</keyword><keyword>Minnesota</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>instrumentation</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24446765</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12116</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Models for the regulation of thrombopoiesis predict that platelet  mass is the biologically regulated variable, yet clinical evaluations of thrombopoiesis are often based on platelet number. When thrombocytopenia and variation in platelet size occur concurrently, platelet count may poorly estimate total platelet mass, confounding clinical decision making. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that plateletcrit (PCT) provides clinically important information when platelet number is an incomplete representation of platelet mass, such as in genetic macrothrombocytopenia. METHODS: We retrospectively compared platelet count and PCTs with general reference intervals for 4 groups of dogs: sick Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) and Greyhounds, presented for nonhematopoietic disease to the University of Minnesota (measured using an Advia 2120) and Auburn University Teaching Hospitals (measured using an Advia 120) over a 3-year period. RESULTS: A canine PCT reference interval of 0.129-0.403% was established. None of the 4 sample groups had significantly more individuals below the reference interval for plateletcrit. For platelet count, only the 2 CKCS groups had significantly more individuals below the reference interval than predicted. CONCLUSION: Use of the PCT as determined by the Advia 120/2120 appeared to avoid overestimation of low platelet mass in sick CKCS in a clinical setting. In contrast, the PCT performed similarly to the platelet count in evaluation of platelet mass in sick Greyhounds. Evaluation of the PCT should be considered in other conditions associated with increased mean platelet volume.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polton, Gerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examining the risk of anal sac gland carcinoma in cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>557</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Gland Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16961479</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00221.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driver, Colin J</author><author>De Risio, Luisa</author><author>Hamilton, Sarah</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Dennis, Ruth</author><author>McGonnell, Imelda M</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes over time in craniocerebral morphology and syringomyelia in cavalier King  Charles spaniels with Chiari-like malformation.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>215</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23136935</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1746-6148-8-215</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia is a neurological  disease complex with high prevalence in cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). The natural progression of this disease with time has not been described. The objectives of this study were to i) determine if syringomyelia progresses with time ii) determine if features of craniocrebral morphology previously associated with CM are progressive (including caudal cranial fossa volume, caudal cranial fossa parenchymal volume, ventricular dimensions, height of the foramen magnum and degree of cerebellar herniation). A retrospective morphometric analysis was undertaken in 12 CKCS with CM for which repeat magnetic resonance images were available without surgical intervention. RESULTS: The maximal syrinx width, height of the foramen magnum, length of cerebellar herniation and caudal cranial fossa volume increased over time. Ventricular and caudal fossa parenchymal volumes were not significantly different between scans. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that syringomyelia progresses with time. Increased caudal cranial fossa volume may be associated with active resorption of the supraoccipital bone, which has previously been found in histology specimens from adult CKCS. We hypothesise that active resorption of the supraoccipital bone occurs due to pressure from the cerebellum. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and variable natural clinical progression of CM and syringomyelia in CKCS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, S</author><author>Olby, N J</author><author>Griffith, E H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Longitudinal Study of the Relationship among Craniocervical Morphology, Clinical  Progression, and Syringomyelia in a Cohort of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1090-1098</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Axial Joint</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27311874</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14362</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Craniocervical junction (CCJ) anomalies and secondary syringomyelia  are commonly diagnosed in Cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). Familiarity with the natural history of these abnormalities is vital to understanding the disease syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of worsening clinical signs, syringomyelia, and morphology in CKCS longitudinally. ANIMALS: Fifty-four client-owned CKCS, 5-13 years old; 50% currently symptomatic. METHODS: Longitudinal observational study. We enrolled CKCS with an MRI of the CCJ performed ≥3 years earlier. We used questionnaires and neurologic examinations to grade initial and current clinical status. Dogs that could be anesthetized were reimaged. Morphologic assessments included the presence and severity of: Chiari-like malformations, medullary position, atlantooccipital overlapping (AOO), dorsal atlantoaxial bands, and syringomyelia. Cranial cavity volumes and foramen magnum height were measured. RESULTS: Clinical status was evaluated in 54 dogs; 36/54 were reimaged. Mean follow-up was 71 months. Of initially asymptomatic dogs, 32% were symptomatic at re-evaluation. Of initially symptomatic dogs, 56% had worsened; 13% had improved with medical management. The morphology of the CCJ at initial imaging did not predict development of either new or worsened signs or syringomyelia by the time of re-evaluation. CONCLUSION: Craniocervical junction anomalies assessed in this study did not appear predictive of future clinical status or syringomyelia in our cohort. The impacts of syringomyelia, AOO, and atlantoaxial bands on future clinical status merit further study in larger groups of CKCS. Clinical progression in our cohort of medically managed CKCS did not differ substantially from published reports of those treated surgically.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, S</author><author>Olby, N J</author><author>Griffith, E H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Medullary position at the craniocervical junction in mature cavalier King Charles  spaniels: relationship with neurologic signs and syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>882-886</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medulla Oblongata</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25929341</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12605</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Medullary elevation (ie, medullary kinking) at the craniocervical  junction (CCJ) is reported in dogs with Chiari-like malformations (CM), but its diagnostic criteria and clinical relevance are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe the position of the medulla at the CCJ in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS), and evaluate its relationship with clinical status and the presence of syringomyelia. ANIMALS: Thirty-six CKCS, 5-12 years of age, including 16 asymptomatic dogs. METHODS: Dogs were assigned a neurologic grade; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the CCJ then was performed. The presence of a CM and syringomyelia was recorded and syringomyelia severity was quantified. Medullary position was quantified using the medullary kinking index, the elevation angle and obex position relative to the foramen magnum. The relationship between medullary position measures and presence and severity of neurologic signs and syringomyelia was investigated. RESULTS: Chiari-like malformation was found in 33 dogs; 26 of them had syringomyelia. Mean medullary kinking index was 46.4% (SD, 10.3), elevation angle was 132° (SD, 12) and obex position was 3.5 mm (SD, 0.8). A higher medullary kinking index was associated with the presence of neurologic signs (P = .0368). Obex position was associated with the presence (P = .0018) and severity of syringomyelia (P = .0164). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There is a significant association between medullary elevation and clinical signs, whereas more caudal brainstem positions appear related to the presence of syringomyelia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richtsmeier, J T</author><author>Sack, G H Jr</author><author>Grausz, H M</author><author>Cork, L C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cleft palate with autosomal recessive transmission in Brittany spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American  Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American  Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association</full-title></periodical><pages>364-371</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cleft Palate</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes, Lethal</keyword><keyword>Genes, Recessive</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Sex Ratio</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7986797</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1597/1545-1569_1994_031_0364_cpwart_2.3.co_2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In the course of maintaining a large colony of Brittany spaniels for studying a  dominantly inherited motor neuron trait, cases of sporadic complete cleft palate were observed.

In this study, we report on the incidence of cleft palate in this dog kindred, describe the gross morphologic characteristics of the cleft, and present a morphometric analysis of the skull of two of the cleft palate pups and one unaffected pup that died at birth. Our data thus far indicate 26.9% incidence of cleft palate in the colony. Pedigree analysis indicates that this cleft palate trait is inherited as an autosomal recessive. High resolution computed tomography scans of the pup heads were used in morphometric comparison of normal and cleft palate pups. We found specific morphologic differences between the cranial base and palate of normal and cleft palate pups. Plans for future studies of the genetics and growth and development of this animal model are discussed. This canine cleft palate trait provides an ideal model for studying a malformation common in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kromhout, K</author><author>van Bree, H</author><author>Broeckx, B J G</author><author>Bhatti, S</author><author>Van Ham, L</author><author>Polis, I</author><author>Gielen, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low-field MRI and multislice CT for the detection of cerebellar (foramen magnum)  herniation in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>238-242</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Encephalocele</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25408117</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12498</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) have a high prevalence of  Chiari-like malformation (CM). Herniation of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum is a key diagnostic feature for CM. Midsagittal MR images are the preferred technique for visualizing cerebellar herniation (CH). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CT can be used to diagnose CH. ANIMALS: Fifteen client-owned CKCS dogs referred for investigation of the brain and cranial cervical spine on MRI and CT. METHODS: Two reviewers retrospectively analyzed midsagittal T1WSE and T2WSE MR images and midsagittal pre- and postcontrast 2D multiplanar reformatted CT images from each dog for the presence of CH. And, if present, the length (mm, CHL) of the herniation was measured. The results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the different observers and techniques for the detection of CH and measurement of CHL. Overall, the CHL was longer on the CT images. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Both techniques are useful for detecting CH and measuring CHL. Because CHL does not have a known direct impact on the clinical presentation of CM, CT can be used as a diagnostic tool in a routine clinical practice for CM in CKCS when MRI is not available. We emphasize that MRI is the standard screening technique in CKCS for breeding purposes to detect the presence of CM and SM and, at the current time, CT cannot replace MRI.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, B</author><author>Toivio-Kinnucan, M</author><author>Schuller, S</author><author>Boudreaux, M K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutation in beta1-tubulin correlates with macrothrombocytopenia in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>540-545</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Substitution</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>Tubulin</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18466252</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0085.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) have a high prevalence of  inherited macrothrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if a mutation in beta1-tubulin correlated with presumptive inherited macrothrombocytopenia. HYPOTHESIS: A mutation in beta1-tubulin results in synthesis of an altered beta1-tubulin monomer. alpha-beta tubulin dimers within microtubule protofilaments are unstable, resulting in altered megakaryocyte proplatelet formation. ANIMALS: Blood samples were obtained from CKCS and non-CKCS dogs. METHODS: DNA was used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to evaluate beta1-tubulin. Platelet numbers and mean platelet volume (MPV) were evaluated for a correlation with the presence or absence of a mutation identified in beta1-tubulin. Platelets obtained from homozygous, heterozygous, and clear CKCS were further evaluated using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: A mutation in the gene encoding beta1-tubulin correlated with macrothrombocytopenia in CKCS. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies suggest that platelet microtubules are present but most likely are unstable and decreased in number. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The macrothrombocytopenia of CKCS correlated with a mutation in beta1-tubulin. alpha-beta tubulin dimers within protofilaments most likely are unstable, leading to altered proplatelet formation by megakaryocytes. This information will aid in distinguishing inherited from acquired thrombocytopenia. It also provides insight into the mechanism of platelet production by megakaryocytes, and also may prove useful in understanding heart-related changes in macrothrombocytopenic CKCS with concurrent mitral valve regurgitation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thøfner, M S</author><author>Stougaard, C L</author><author>Westrup, U</author><author>Madry, A A</author><author>Knudsen, C S</author><author>Berg, H</author><author>Jensen, C S E</author><author>Handby, R M L</author><author>Gredal, H</author><author>Fredholm, M</author><author>Berendt, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and heritability of symptomatic syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels and long-term outcome in symptomatic and asymptomatic littermates.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>243-250</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Denmark</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Interviews as Topic</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25308931</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12475</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia (SM) is common in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  (CKCS). Dogs with syringes express clinical signs or might be clinically silent. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and heritability of symptomatic SM, the association between clinical signs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and long-term outcome. ANIMALS: All CKCS registered in the Danish Kennel Club in 2001 (n = 240). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based prevalence study validated by telephone interviews and clinically investigated clinical signs of SM. Dogs were 6 years at the time of investigation. A prospective observational litter study including clinical investigations, MRI and 5-year follow-up of symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings. Heritability was estimated based on the scale of liability in the study population and litter cohort. RESULTS: The cross-sectional study estimated a prevalence of symptomatic SM at 15.4% in the population. Thirteen symptomatic and 9 asymptomatic siblings participated in the litter study. Spinal cord syringes were confirmed in 21 of 22 littermates (95%). Syrinx diameter and mean syrinx : spinal cord ratio were significantly correlated with clinical signs (P &lt; .01). Estimated heritability of symptomatic SM was 0.81. Symptomatic SM motivated euthanasia in 20%. Dogs with syringes, which expressed no clinical signs at the age of 6, remained asymptomatic in 14/15 cases (93%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of symptomatic SM is high and genetics have a high impact on clinical disease expression. Further investigations of factors influencing the outbreak threshold of clinical signs of SM are desirable.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Madsen, Majbritt Busk</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth Høier</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Höglund, Katja</author><author>Ljungvall, Ingrid</author><author>Falk, Torkel</author><author>Wess, Gerhard</author><author>Stephenson, Hannah</author><author>Dukes-McEwan, Joanna</author><author>Chetboul, Valérie</author><author>Gouni, Vassiliki</author><author>Proschowsky, Helle Friis</author><author>Cirera, Susanna</author><author>Karlskov-Mortensen, Peter</author><author>Fredholm, Merete</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of 2 loci associated with development of myxomatous mitral valve  disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>S62-7</pages><volume>102 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Europe</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21846748</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/esr041</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease in dogs.  It is characterized by chronic progressive degenerative lesions of the mitral valve. The valve leaflets become thickened and prolapse into the left atrium resulting in mitral regurgitation (MR). MMVD is most prevalent in small to medium sized dog breeds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) in particular. The onset of MMVD is highly age dependent, and at the age of 10 years, nearly all CKCS are affected. The incidence of a similar disease in humans-mitral valve prolapse-is 1-5%. By defining CKCSs with an early onset of MMVD as cases and old dogs with no or mild signs of MMVD as controls, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with development of MMVD. We have identified a 1.58 Mb region on CFA13 (P(genome) = 4.0 × 10(-5)) and a 1.68 Mb region on CFA14 (P(genome) = 7.9 × 10(-4)) associated with development of MMVD. This confirms the power of using the dog as a model to uncover potential candidate regions involved in the molecular mechanisms behind complex traits.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Black, V L</author><author>Whitworth, F J S</author><author>Adamantos, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pyrexia in juvenile dogs: a review of 140 referred cases.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>116-120</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arteritis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fever</keyword><keyword>Meningitis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30284718</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12938</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To describe the presentation, influence of previous treatment and  diagnosis in juvenile dogs presenting with pyrexia to a UK referral centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of dogs aged 1 to 18 months presenting with a problem list including pyrexia (≥⃒39∙2°C) that was reproducible during referral hospitalisation were retrospectively reviewed. Signalment, history - including previous treatment, clinical examination findings and diagnosis were recorded. Diagnoses were categorised as non-infectious inflammatory, infectious, congenital, neoplastic and miscellaneous. The influence of previous treatment on the ability to reach a final diagnosis was analysed. RESULTS: A total of 140 cases was identified. Diagnosis was reached in 115 cases. Non-infectious inflammatory disease was identified in 91 cases (79%), infectious disease in 19 cases (17%), a congenital disorder in four dogs (3%) and neoplasia in one dog (1%). Breeds most commonly identified were Border collies (17/140; 12%), beagles (16/140; 11%), Labrador retrievers (11/140; 8%), springer spaniels (9/140; 6%) and cocker spaniels (8/140; 6%). Before presentation, most dogs had received antibiotics (83/140; 59%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (84/140; 60%) or steroids (9/140; 6%), either alone or in combination. Neither antibiotics nor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs influenced the ability to reach a diagnosis. Steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis comprised 55 of 91 (60%) individuals of the non-infectious inflammatory cohort. All four dogs diagnosed with congenital disorders were Border collies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Non-infectious inflammatory disease, particularly steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis, immune-mediated polyarthritis and metaphyseal osteopathy, was commonly diagnosed in this population of pyrexic juvenile dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oyama, M A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Re: Radiographic heart size and its rate of increase as tests for the onset of  congestive heart failure in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with mitral valve regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>227; author reply 228-9</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Myocardium</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22432528</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00879.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, Hilary Zhaoxu</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Constantino-Casas, Fernando</author><author>Jeffery, Nick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in the spinal  cord of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by symptomatic syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>318-320</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Substance P</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21925690</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.08.012</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The causes of clinical signs associated with syringomyelia in the Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel (CKCS) are incompletely understood. In this study we compared expression of two pain-related neuropeptides: substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), in the spinal cord dorsal horn of normal dogs with that in CKCS with and without clinical signs of syringomyelia. There was a decrease in expression of both peptides in CKCS with 'symptomatic' syringomyelia that was also associated with significant asymmetry in SP-I and similar, though non-significant, asymmetry in CGRP-I compared with other groups. The asymmetric distribution of these pain-related peptides may be a consequence of syrinx-associated damage to grey matter but may also play a role in generation of pain.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ware, W A</author><author>Reina-Doreste, Y</author><author>Stern, J A</author><author>Meurs, K M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sudden death associated with QT interval prolongation and KCNQ1 gene mutation in  a family of English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>561-568</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Death, Sudden</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>KCNQ1 Potassium Channel</keyword><keyword>Long QT Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25779927</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12550</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: A 5-year-old, healthy English Springer Spaniel died suddenly 4 months  after delivering a litter of 7 puppies. Within 4 months of the dam's death, 3 offspring also died suddenly. HYPOTHESIS: Abnormal cardiac repolarization, caused by an inherited long QT syndrome, is thought to be responsible for arrhythmias leading to sudden death in this family. ANIMALS: Four remaining dogs from the affected litter and 11 related dogs. METHODS: Physical examination and resting ECG were done on the littermates and 9 related dogs. Additional tests on some or all littermates included echocardiogram with Doppler, Holter monitoring, and routine serum biochemistry. Blood for DNA sequencing was obtained from all 15 dogs. RESULTS: Three of 4 littermates examined, but no other dogs, had prolonged QT intervals with unique T-wave morphology. DNA sequencing of the KCNQ1 gene identified a heterozygous single base pair mutation, unique to these 3 dogs, which changes a conserved amino acid from threonine to lysine and is predicted to change protein structure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This family represents the first documentation in dogs of spontaneous familial QT prolongation, which was associated with a KCNQ1 gene mutation and sudden death. Although the final rhythm could not be documented in these dogs, their phenotypic manifestations of QT interval prolongation and abnormal ECG restitution suggested increased risk for sudden arrhythmic death. The KCNQ1 gene mutation identified is speculated to impair the cardiac repolarizing current IKs, similar to KCNQ1 mutations causing long QT syndrome 1 in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, S</author><author>Olby, N J</author><author>Griffith, E H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dorsal compressive atlantoaxial bands and the craniocervical junction syndrome:  association with clinical signs and syringomyelia in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>887-892</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Axial Joint</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Compression</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25996662</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12604</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Dorsal compressive lesions at the atlantoaxial junction (ie, AA  bands) occur in dogs with Chiari-like malformations (CMs), but their clinical relevance is unclear. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the influence of AA bands on clinical status and syringomyelia (SM) in mature cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). ANIMALS: Thirty-six CKCS, 5-12 years of age, including 20 dogs with neuropathic pain. METHODS: Dogs were examined and assigned a neurologic grade. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the craniocervical junction was performed with the craniocervical junction extended and flexed (ie, normal standing position). Imaging studies were assessed for the presence of an AA band, CM, SM or some combination of these findings. Band and SM severity were quantified using an objective compression index and ordinal grading scale, respectively. RESULTS: Of 36 CKCS imaged, 34 had CM. Atlantoaxial bands were associated with the presence (P = .0031) but not the severity (P = .008) of clinical signs, whereas their presence was associated with both the presence and severity of SM (P = .0147, P = .0311, respectively ). Higher compression indices were associated with more severe SM (P = .0137). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of AA bands in older CKCS is high. Positioning of dogs in extension during MRI enhances the sensitivity of the study for detecting this important abnormality. There were significant associations among AA bands, clinical signs, and SM in dogs with CM; additional work is needed to understand whether or not this relationship is causal.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Malik, R</author><author>Hunt, G B</author><author>Allan, G S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of mitral valve insufficiency in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>302-303</pages><volume>130</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Morbidity</keyword><keyword>New South Wales</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1595150</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.130.14.302</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spiljak Pakkanen, M</author><author>Domanjko Petrič, A</author><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Stepančič, A</author><author>Schlegel, T T</author><author>Falk, T</author><author>Rasmussen, C E</author><author>Starc, V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Advanced electrocardiographic parameters change with severity of mitral  regurgitation in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in sinus rhythm.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>93-100</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Principal Component Analysis</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22168834</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00845.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Multiple advanced resting ECG (A-ECG) techniques have improved the  diagnostic or prognostic value of ECG in detecting human cardiac diseases even before onset of clinical signs or changes in conventional ECG. OBJECTIVE: To determine which A-ECG parameters, derived from 12-lead A-ECG recordings, change with severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) in sinus rhythm. ANIMALS: Seventy-six privately owned CKCSs. METHODS: Dogs were prospectively divided into 5 groups according to the degree of MR (estimated by color Doppler mapping as the percentage of the left atrial area affected by the MR jet) and presence of clinical signs. High fidelity approximately 5-minute 12-lead ECG recordings were evaluated using custom software to calculate multiple conventional and A-ECG parameters. RESULTS: Nineteen of 76 ECG parameters were significantly different (P &lt; .05) across the 5 dog groups. A 4-parameter model that incorporated results from 1 parameter of heart rate variability, 2 parameters of QT variability, and 1 parameter of QRS amplitude was identified that explained 82.4% of the variance with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.60 (P &lt; .01). When age or murmur grade was included in the statistical model the prediction value further increased the R to 0.74 and 0.85 (P &lt; .01), respectively. CONCLUSION: In CKCSs with sinus rhythm, 4 selected A-ECG parameters further improve prediction of MR jet severity beyond age and murmur grade, although the predictive increment in this study probably is not sufficient to warrant utilization in clinical veterinary practice.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Munro, K J</author><author>Cox, C L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of hearing impairment in Cavalier King Charles spaniels using  auditory brainstem response audiometry.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>2-5</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Audiometry, Evoked Response</keyword><keyword>Auditory Threshold</keyword><keyword>Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electroencephalography</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Hearing Disorders</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9121129</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.1997.tb02976.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Auditory brainstem response audiometry was used to investigate nine Cavalier King  Charles spaniels with a history of hearing impairment.

This newly recognized disorder shares striking similarities in clinical features and biopsy findings to the other acral mutilation syndromes or hereditary sensory neuropathies reported in German short-haired pointer dogs, English pointer dogs and English springer spaniels. Clinical signs are first noted between 3.5 and 12 months of age. Affected dogs lick, bite and severely self-mutilate their distal extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infection. Auto-amputation of claws, digits and footpads occurs in severe cases. Single or multiple feet can be affected. Affected dogs walked on their severely mutilated feet without evidence of pain, lameness, or ataxia. The majority of the dogs were euthanized within days to months of diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beardow, A W</author><author>Buchanan, J W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic mitral valve disease in cavalier King Charles spaniels: 95 cases  (1987-1991).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1023-1029</pages><volume>203</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography, Doppler</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Auscultation</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Pennsylvania</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><accession-num>8135932</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Systolic heart murmurs caused by chronic mitral valve disease are particularly  common in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) in Great Britain. To determine if American-bred CKCS have a similar high prevalence of chronic valve disease, results of stethoscopic examinations on 394 CKCS were analyzed. Left apical systolic heart murmurs were found in 22% of the dogs. The prevalence ranged from 9% in dogs &lt; 1 year old to 100% in those &gt; or = 10 years old; prevalence was 56% in dogs &gt; or = 4 years old. Differences were not found in prevalence between sexes and among various coat colors. Reexamination of 79 dogs after 1 year revealed an incidence of new murmurs of 21%. Comparison of ages at initial examination in 128 referral hospital cases with chronic mitral valve disease revealed a mean age of 6.25 years in 17 CKCS, in contrast to a mean age of 12 years in other breeds. Echocardiographic and necropsy findings indicated that ruptured chordae tendineae and mitral valve prolapse are major components in the chronic valve disease process in CKCS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Felkai, C</author><author>Vörös, K</author><author>Vrabély, T</author><author>Vetési, F</author><author>Karsai, F</author><author>Papp, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ultrasonographic findings of renal dysplasia in cocker spaniels: eight cases.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</full-title></periodical><pages>397-408</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fibrosis</keyword><keyword>Kidney Cortex</keyword><keyword>Kidney Diseases</keyword><keyword>Kidney Failure, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9557317</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A retrospective study of eight young Cocker Spaniels aged 9-24 months was  performed to describe the ultrasonographic findings of histologically confirmed renal dysplasia. Ultrasonography revealed kidneys of significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced volume in all dogs. During qualitative evaluation, two different types of sonographic alterations could be seen. In one type of the ultrasound alterations, corticomedullary demarcation was distinct and the renal cortex was remarkably thin, which was best seen in the dorsal (frontal) imaging plane. In the other type of the ultrasound appearance, overall increased echogenicity with poor corticomedullary demarcation was noticed, and the kidneys could hardly be separated from their surroundings. These features were best recognised in the sagittal (coronal) imaging plane. In one dog with secondary hypercalcaemia, a hyperechoic corticomedullary area was also seen. Post-mortem histological diagnosis revealed renal dysplasia and secondary fibrosis. Based on ultrasound findings alone, renal dysplasia (renal familial disease) can be suspected when small kidneys with thin echogenic cortex are present in young dogs. An ultrasound image, similar to that of fibrotic kidneys (increased overall echogenicity and reduced corticomedullary definition) cannot be differentiated from chronic inflammatory disease and from end-stage kidneys. Therefore, ultrasound-guided biopsy or post-mortem histology is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of renal dysplasia. This is the first study reporting on the ultrasound appearance of renal dysplasia in Cocker Spaniel dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>German, A J</author><author>Holden, D J</author><author>Hall, E J</author><author>Day, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eosinophilic diseases in two Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>533-538</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Chemical Analysis</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage</keyword><keyword>Bronchoscopy</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Diarrhea</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dyspnea</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Eosinophilia</keyword><keyword>Stomatitis</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Urinalysis</keyword><keyword>Vomiting</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12489741</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2002.tb00026.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This report describes the clinical presentation of two Cavalier King Charles  spaniels with different eosinophilic diseases.

In our study we examine the influence of allometric scaling of the brain and cranial cavity volume on morphological parameters in different dog breeds. MRI scans of 110 dogs (35 mesaticephalic dogs, 35 brachycephalic dogs, 20 CKCSs with SM, and 20 CKCSs without SM) have been used to create 3-dimensional volumetric models of skull and brain parts. Volumes were related to body weight calculating the adjusted means for different breeds. RESULTS: There was a strong global dependency of all volumes to body weight (P &lt; 0.0001). The adjusted means of the absolute and relative volumes of brain parenchyma and cranial compartments are not significantly larger in CKCSs in comparison to brachycephalic and mesaticephalic dogs. A difference in absolute or relative volumes between CKCSs with and without SM after relating these values to body weight could not be identified. The relative volume of the hindbrain parenchyma (caudal fossa parenchyma percentage) was larger in brachycephalic dogs than in CKCSs, without causing herniation or SM. CONCLUSION: An influence of body weight exist in dogs, which can be sufficiently large to render conclusions on the difference in volumes of the brain and skull unsafe unless some account of the body weight is taken in the analysis. The results of this study challenge the role of overcrowding for the development of SM in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, M J</author><author>Roth, J</author><author>Ondreka, N</author><author>Kramer, M</author><author>Rummel, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A potential role for substance P and interleukin-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid of  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with neuropathic pain.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>530-535</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-6</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Substance P</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>cerebrospinal fluid</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23659719</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12080</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain can be a clinical sign in Cavalier King Charles  Spaniels (CKCS) with syringomyelia. The pathophysiology of this pain is not fully understood. HYPOTHESIS: Neuropathic pain in CKCS is a result of a neuroinflammatory process. ANIMALS: Twenty-six client-owned dogs: 15 dogs with clinical signs of cervical hyperesthesia (group 1), and 11 dogs without of clinical signs (group 2). METHODS: Dogs were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and substance P were measured in CSF and compared with morphological findings on MRI and clinical pain scores. RESULTS: All dogs without clinical signs had symmetrical syringomyelia, whereas in the group with pain, 6 dogs had symmetrical and 9 dogs had asymmetrical syringomyelia. Pain and syringomyelia asymmetry were correlated, and a strong association between pain and dorsal horn involvement of syringomyelia was observed. There was no significant difference between the mean width of the syringomyelia in dogs with or without pain. The concentrations of interleukin-6 and substance P were significantly higher in dogs with neuropathic pain. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was not detected in either group. Concentrations of substance P were significantly higher in dogs with asymmetrical syringomyelia or dorsal horn involvement, whereas interleukin-6 concentrations were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: Release of interleukin-6 and substance P may initiate proinflammatory effects leading to development of persistent pain in CKCSs with syringomyelia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cremer, Signe E</author><author>Kristensen, Annemarie T</author><author>Reimann, Maria J</author><author>Eriksen, Nynne B</author><author>Petersen, Stine F</author><author>Marschner, Clara B</author><author>Tarnow, Inge</author><author>Oyama, Mark A</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasma and serum serotonin concentrations and surface-bound platelet serotonin  expression in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>520-531</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Platelet Activation</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Rich Plasma</keyword><keyword>Serotonin</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26000599</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.76.6.520</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum and plasma serotonin concentrations, percentage  of serotonin-positive platelets, level of surface-bound platelet serotonin expression (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI]), and platelet activation (CD62 expression) in platelet-rich plasma from Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). ANIMALS: Healthy dogs (n = 15) and dogs with mild MMVD (18), moderate-severe MMVD (19), or severe MMVD with congestive heart failure (CHF; 10). PROCEDURES: Blood samples were collected from each dog. Serum and plasma serotonin concentrations were measured with an ELISA, and surface-bound platelet serotonin expression and platelet activation were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Dogs with mild MMVD had higher median serum (746 ng/mL) and plasma (33.3 ng/mL) serotonin concentrations, compared with MMVD-affected dogs with CHF (388 ng/mL and 9.9 ng/mL, respectively), but no other group differences were found. Among disease groups, no differences in surface-bound serotonin expression or platelet activation were found. Thrombocytopenic dogs had lower serum serotonin concentration (482 ng/mL) than nonthrombocytopenic dogs (731 ng/mL). In 26 dogs, a flow cytometry scatterplot subpopulation (FSSP) of platelets was identified; dogs with an FSSP had a higher percentage of serotonin-positive platelets (11.0%), higher level of surface-bound serotonin expression (MFI, 32,068), and higher platelet activation (MFI, 2,363) than did dogs without an FSSP (5.7%, 1,230, and 1,165, respectively). An FSSP was present in 93.8% of thrombocytopenic dogs and in 29.5% of nonthrombocytopenic dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A substantive influence of circulating serotonin on MMVD stages prior to CHF development in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels was not supported by the study findings. An FSSP of highly activated platelets with pronounced serotonin binding was strongly associated with thrombocytopenia but not MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Lorentzen, K A</author><author>Kristensen, B O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse in cavalier King Charles spaniels:  epidemiology and prognostic significance for regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>315-320</pages><volume>144</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Denmark</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mass Screening</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10212505</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.144.12.315</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study investigated the epidemiology and prognostic significance of mitral  valve prolapse, detected by ultrasonography, in 153 cavalier King Charles spaniels which were screened consecutively during a period of one year.

The screening revealed that 82 per cent of the dogs aged one to three years and 97 per cent of the dogs over three years had various degrees of mitral valve prolapse. The presence and severity of the condition were independent of gender but correlated positively with age and negatively with bodyweight. The degree of mitral valve prolapse at screening correlated with the regurgitation status (murmur intensity and size of the regurgitant jets) at re-examination and with the percentage increase in the left ventricular end diastolic diameter over the three-year period. The presence of a grade I murmur was not a useful prognostic indicator.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarnow, Inge</author><author>Kristensen, Annemarie T</author><author>Texel, Helle</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decreased platelet function in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with mitral valve  regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>680-686</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation</keyword><keyword>Platelet Function Tests</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>instrumentation</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>14529135</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2003.tb02500.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>With aggregometry, increased platelet activity has been reported in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels (CKCS) without mitral regurgitation (MR). In contrast, dogs with MR have been found to have decreased platelet activity. The purpose of this study was to test an easy bedside test of platelet function (the Platelet Function Analyzer [PFA-100]) to see if it could detect an increase in platelet activity in CKCS without MR and a decrease in platelet activity in CKCS with MR. This study included 101 clinically healthy dogs &gt; 1 year of age: 15 control dogs of different breeds and 86 CKCS. None of the dogs received medication or had a history of bleeding. The PFA-100 evaluates platelet function in anticoagulated whole blood under high shear stress. Results are given as closure times (CT): the time it takes before a platelet plug occludes a hole in a membrane coated by agonists. The CT with collagen and adenosine-diphosphate as agonists was similar in control dogs (median 62 seconds; interquartile interval 55-66 seconds) and CKCS with no or minimal MR (55; 52-64 seconds). The CT was higher in CKCS with mild MR (regurgitant jet occupying 15-50% of the left atrial area) (75; 60-84 seconds; P = .0007) and in CKCS with moderate to severe MR (jet &gt; 50%) (87: 66-102 seconds; P &lt; .0001). CKCS with mild, moderate, and severe, clinically inapparent MR have decreased platelet function. The previous finding of increased platelet reactivity in nonthrombocytopenic CKCS without MR could not be reproduced with the PFA-100 device.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author><author>Häggstrom, Jens</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Christensen, Knud</author><author>Selin, Anna</author><author>Burmeister, Malene L</author><author>Larsen, Heidi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels is an  autosomal recessive trait.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>169-173</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoanalysis</keyword><keyword>Cell Size</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Aberrations</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes, Recessive</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11899033</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2002)016&lt;0169:iatick&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) often have idiopathic asymptomatic  thrombocytopenia. In affected dogs, the thrombocytes often are large, and it has been speculated that the condition could be an inherited macrothrombocytopenia. The aim of this study was to examine the inheritance of idiopathic, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in CKCS. Sixteen families (both parents and &gt; or = 3 offspring) of privately owned CKCS were included. There were 105 clinically healthy dogs (50 from Denmark and 55 from Sweden): 81 offspring and 26 parents (2 dogs had both roles). Because autoanalyzers have difficulty counting large platelets, the platelets were counted manually, with a counting chamber. Platelet counts were not influenced by age, gender, or heart murmur status. Thrombocytopenia (&lt; or = 100,000 platelets/microL) was found in 46% of the parents. The pedigrees indicated that thrombocytopenia segregated as an autosomal recessive trait and that 100,000 platelets/microL was appropriate as a lower limit of normal. Affected offspring were found in all families, showing that all of the included parents were at least carriers. Therefore, the expected segregation ratios (which were in good accordance with the observed ones) were 1:0, 1:1, and 1:3 for the 3 crosses: affected x affected, normal x affected, and normal x normal. Within a given cross, the mean parental platelet count had no influence on the platelet counts of the offspring. We conclude that idiopathic, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in CKCS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The condition most likely constitutes an inherited macrothrombocytopenia in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Couturier, J</author><author>Rault, D</author><author>Cauzinille, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in normal cavalier King Charles  spaniels: a multiple diagnostic imaging approach.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>438-443</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Axial Joint</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Occipital Joint</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>France</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Tomography, Spiral Computed</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18631225</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2008.00578.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were (1) to report the incidence of  Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in a normal French cavalier King Charles spaniel breeding population; (2) to precise the standard computed tomography dimensions of the caudal fossa and (3) to investigate the use of ultrasonography in diagnosis of this syndrome. METHODS: Clinically normal adult cavalier King Charles spaniel underwent ultrasonographic examination of the spinal cord and caudal fossa. Computed tomography was used to measure the caudal fossa and magnetic resonance imaging allowed syringomyelia and cerebellar herniation identification. RESULTS: Of the 16 dogs in the study, seven had syringomyelia (43.7 per cent). All dogs had cerebellar herniation, suggesting Chiari-like malformation and also a tendency to occipital dysplasia. Computed tomography measurements of the caudal fossa are reported. In one dog, a syrinx was identified by ultrasonography. The only difference between dogs with or without syringomyelia was that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia were statistically older. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The incidence of Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia may be high in an asymptomatic population of cavalier King Charles spaniel . Computed tomography measurements reported in this study should now be compared with those of a symptomatic population to evaluate the hypothesis that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia syndrome have a smaller caudal fossa. This study did not identify a smaller caudal fossa in an asymptomatic cavalier King Charles spaniel population with syringomyelia. Ultrasonography probably has a low sensitivity for diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driver, C J</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Cross, H R</author><author>McGonnell, I</author><author>Volk, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship of brain parenchyma within the caudal cranial fossa and ventricle  size to syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>382-386</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cerebrospinal Fluid</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20536691</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2010.00952.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To assess if the volumes of the caudal cranial fossa (CCF),  parenchyma within the caudal cranial fossa (CCFP) or ventricles (V) are associated with syringomyelia (SM) in cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) with Chiari-like malformation (CM).

If present, syrinx size was measured from its maximal transverse width. The percentages were statistically compared between groups, and correlation between percentages and syrinx dimensions was made. RESULTS: CKCS with SM had significantly higher CCFP (P=0.0001) and V (P=0.0002) to those without but no significant difference in CCF (P=0.925). There was a positive correlation between CCFP and syrinx width (Pearson r=0.437) and ventricle size to syrinx width (Spearman r=0.627). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A more marked overcrowding of the CCF is associated with SM, which may explain the high incidence of SM in CKCS with CM. The association between ventricle and syrinx dimensions supports the theory that SM development is the result of altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skelly, B J</author><author>Sargan, D R</author><author>Winchester, B G</author><author>Smith, M O</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author><author>Giger, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic screening for fucosidosis in English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>726-729</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>Base Pairing</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>Cytosine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fucosidosis</keyword><keyword>Gene Amplification</keyword><keyword>Genetic Carrier Screening</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Guanine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10376901</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To develop a robust molecular genetic test for alpha-L-fucosidosis in  English Springer Spaniels and to screen dogs from the United Kingdom and United States for the mutant allele. ANIMALS: 35 English-bred English Springer Spaniels, 60 American-bred English Springer Spaniels, and 1 affected dog and its parents from a family of English Springer Spaniels in Colorado. PROCEDURE: Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to amplify the mutated region in the gene encoding alpha-L-fucosidase. High guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the region required use of an amplification buffer with high pH. Mutant and normal alleles were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular genetic test results were compared with enzyme data. RESULTS: A 262-bp PCR product was amplified from normal dogs and compared with a 248-bp product from affected dogs. Carriers had 1 copy of each allele, distinguishable by the 14-bp size difference. Two carriers among the English-bred dogs were identified by use of enzyme and genomic DNA analyses. The molecular defect in dogs from Colorado was proven to be the same as that in British and Australian dogs. None of the other 60 American-bred dogs carried the mutant allele. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A PCR method that can be used to identify dogs affected with or carriers of the autosomal recessive disease fucosidosis was established. Amplification was achieved within a GC-rich region, using a method that may be useful in overcoming amplification problems in GC-rich areas within other genes. Using this test, fucosidosis can be controlled and ultimately eradicated from the English Springer Spaniel population.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bauer, Bianca S</author><author>Forsyth, George W</author><author>Sandmeyer, Lynne S</author><author>Grahn, Bruce H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relative quantification of white blood cell mitochondrial DNA and assessment of  mitochondria by use of transmission electron microscopy in English Springer Spaniels with and without retinal dysplasia.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>454-459</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA, Mitochondrial</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron, Transmission</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Retinal Dysplasia</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20367054</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.71.4.454</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To compare relative amounts of WBC mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; assessed  via real-time PCR assay) and morphology of lymphocyte mitochondria (assessed via transmission electron microscopy [TEM]) in blood samples collected from English Springer Spaniels with and without retinal dysplasia. ANIMALS: 7 and 5 client-owned English Springer Spaniels (1 to 11 years old) with and without retinal dysplasia, respectively. PROCEDURES: Blood samples were obtained from affected and unaffected dogs via venipuncture. Genomic DNA was extracted from WBCs of the 7 affected and 5 unaffected dogs, and relative quantification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (COX1) was determined via analysis of real-time PCR results. White blood cells from 3 affected and 4 unaffected dogs were embedded in epoxide resin for TEM; cross sections were examined for lymphocytes, which were measured. The mitochondria within lymphocytes were quantified, and the mitochondrial surface area per lymphocyte cross section was calculated. A masked technique was used to compare mitochondrial morphology between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared with the smallest measured quantity of mtDNA among unaffected dogs, mtDNA amounts varied among unaffected (1.08- to 4.76-fold differences) and affected dogs (1- to 2.68-fold differences). Analysis of lymphocyte measurements and mitochondrial surface area, morphology, and quantity revealed no significant differences between affected and unaffected dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: No significant differences were detected in relative amounts of WBC mtDNA or the size, number, or morphology of lymphocyte mitochondria in English Springer Spaniels affected with retinal dysplasia, compared with results for unaffected control dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cross, H R</author><author>Cappello, R</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of cerebral cranium volumes between cavalier King Charles spaniels  with Chiari-like malformation, small breed dogs and Labradors.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>399-405</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Encephalocele</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19689667</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00799.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) have a  proportionately smaller caudal fossa compared with other small dogs and with Labradors. To evaluate if cerebellar herniation in CKCS correlates with caudal fossa volume. METHODS: In this retrospective study, three-dimensional images were created from magnetic resonance imaging brain series of 117 dogs (split into three groups: CKCS, Labradors and small breeds) from which the volumes of the fossae and brain parenchyma were calculated. These volumes were transformed into percentages of total cranial cavity and parenchyma volumes, respectively. The percentages were statistically compared among the groups. The percentage of herniated cerebellum in the CKCS was compared using linear regression with the caudal fossa and parenchyma percentages. RESULTS: Cavalier King Charles spaniels had a proportionately smaller caudal fossa compared with Labradors (P=0.002) but not to small breeds (P=0.103). Their caudal fossa parenchyma was proportionately the same volume as Labradors (P=0.976) but greater than small breeds (P=0.005). No relationship was found for the per cent of cerebellum herniated. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results support mesoderm insufficiency or craniosynostosis as the pathogenesis of Chiari-like malformation (CM) in CKCS. It presents evidence for overcrowding of the caudal fossa due to a mismatch of brain parenchyma and fossa volumes as to why CKCS and not other small dogs are affected.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cirovic, Srdjan</author><author>Lloyd, Robert</author><author>Jovanovik, Jelena</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computer simulation of syringomyelia in dogs.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>82</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>cerebrospinal fluid</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29523203</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-018-1410-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia is a pathological condition in which fluid-filled  cavities (syringes) form and expand in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is often linked with obstruction of the craniocervical junction and a Chiari malformation, which is similar in both humans and animals. Some brachycephalic toy breed dogs such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are particularly predisposed. The exact mechanism of the formation of syringomyelia is undetermined and consequently with the lack of clinical explanation, engineers and mathematicians have resorted to computer models to identify possible physical mechanisms that can lead to syringes. We developed a computer model of the spinal cavity of a CKCS suffering from a large syrinx. The model was excited at the cranial end to simulate the movement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the spinal cord due to the shift of blood volume in the cranium related to the cardiac cycle. To simulate the normal condition, the movement was prescribed to the CSF. To simulate the pathological condition, the movement of CSF was blocked. RESULTS: For normal conditions the pressure in the SAS was approximately 400 Pa and the same applied to all stress components in the spinal cord. The stress was uniformly distributed along the length of the spinal cord. When the blockage between the cranial and spinal CSF spaces forced the cord to move with the cardiac cycle, shear and axial normal stresses in the cord increased significantly. The sites where the elevated stress was most pronounced coincided with the axial locations where the syringes typically form, but they were at the perimeter rather than in the central portion of the cord. This elevated stress originated from the bending of the cord at the locations where its curvature was high. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that it is possible that repetitive stressing of the spinal cord caused by its exaggerated movement could be a cause for the formation of initial syringes. Further consideration of factors such as cord tethering and the difference in mechanical properties of white and grey matter is needed to fully explore this possibility.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McLellan, G J</author><author>Cappello, R</author><author>Mayhew, I G</author><author>Elks, R</author><author>Lybaert, P</author><author>Watté, C</author><author>Bedford, P G C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and pathological observations in English cocker spaniels with primary  metabolic vitamin E deficiency and retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>287-292</pages><volume>153</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ataxia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electromyography</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neurologic Examination</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Pigment Epithelium of Eye</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Diseases</keyword><keyword>Vitamin E Deficiency</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>14509574</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.153.10.287</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Fifteen English cocker spaniels with confirmed vitamin E deficiency were examined  physically, ophthalmologically and neurologically.

To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of this disease in American-bred dogs. Affected and carrier status of dogs were determined by measuring the activity of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase in plasma and in leukocytes. Fucosidosis results in neurologic signs, particularly changes in behavior, in adolescent and adult dogs. Late onset of signs may result in misdiagnosis as a primary behavior problem or acquired neurologic disease. Fucosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and carrier dogs are clinically normal. Thus, the abnormal gene can become widespread in a population before homozygous-affected dogs are produced.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tvedten, Harold</author><author>Lilliehöök, Inger</author><author>Hillström, Anna</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plateletcrit is superior to platelet count for assessing platelet status in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>266-271</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelet Disorders</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Tests, Routine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18761517</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-165X.2008.00054.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Many Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) dogs are affected by an  autosomal recessive dysplasia of platelets resulting in fewer but larger platelets. The IDEXX Vet Autoread (QBC) hematology analyzer directly measures the relative volume of platelets in a blood sample (plateletcrit). We hypothesized that CKCS both with and without hereditary macrothrombocytosis would have a normal plateletcrit and that the QBC results would better identify the total circulating volume of platelets in CKSC than methods directly enumerating platelet numbers. OBJECTIVES: The major purpose of this study was to compare the QBC platelet results with platelet counts from other automated and manual methods for evaluating platelet status in CKCS dogs. METHODS: Platelet counts were determined in fresh EDTA blood from 27 adult CKCS dogs using the QBC, Sysmex XT-2000iV (optical and impedance), CELL-DYN 3500, blood smear estimate, and manual methods. Sysmex optical platelet counts were reanalyzed following gating to determine the number and percentage of normal- and large-sized platelets in each blood sample. RESULTS: None of the 27 CKCS dogs had thrombocytopenia (defined as &lt;164 x 10(9) platelets/L) based on the QBC platelet count. Fourteen (52%) to 18 (66%) of the dogs had thrombocytopenia with other methods. The percentage of large platelets, as determined by regating the Sysmex optical platelet counts, ranged from 1% to 75%, in a gradual continuum. CONCLUSIONS: The QBC may be the best analyzer for assessing clinically relevant thrombocytopenia in CKCS dogs, because its platelet count is based on the plateletcrit, a measurement of platelet mass.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stalin, Catherine E</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Granger, Nicolas</author><author>Jeffery, Nick D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Radiographic morphology of the cranial portion of the cervical vertebral column  in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and its relationship to syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>89-93</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Spine</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18167092</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.69.1.89</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To compare radiographic morphology of the atlantoaxial region between  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and dogs of other breeds and determine whether there was an association between radiographic morphology of the atlantoaxial region and syringomyelia in CKCSs.

PROCEDURES: The amount that the spinous process of the axis overlapped the dorsal arch of the atlas, the relative size of the spinous process of the axis, and the amount of widening of the atlantoaxial joint that occurred when the neck was moved from a neutral to a flexed position were measured on lateral radiographic projections of the atlantoaxial region.

Echocardiographic measurements were compared with postmortem measurements in 10 of 17 dogs. The LV weight calculated from the echocardiographic measurements correlated significantly with LV weight at postmortem (P less than 0.05). Echocardiographic measurements of end diastolic and end systolic diameters for the 17 dogs correlated significantly with body surface area (P less than 0.01). Measurements of the interventricular septum were in close agreement with values in clinically normal dogs and were significantly correlated with postmortem measurements (r = 0.94, P less than 0.01). However, 76% of the measurements for LV caudal wall thickness in this group of dogs were above the normal range. Calculation of fractional shortening values identified a group of 5 dogs with reduced fractional shortening (mean +/- SD, 20.97 +/- 3.66%), which indicates that a depression in contractility may be present in some apparently healthy dogs of this kennel population.

DESIGN: Original study. ANIMALS: 45 dogs with IE and 74 siblings and their respective parents. PROCEDURE: IE was diagnosed on the basis of age at the time of seizure onset and results of laboratory testing and neurologic examinations. Simple segregation analysis was performed with the Davie method. RESULTS: Median age at the onset of seizures was 3 years; however, 9 (20%) dogs were between 5 and 6 years old at the time of the onset of seizures. Twenty-one dogs (47%) had generalized seizures, and 24 (53%) had focal onset seizures. Results of segregation analysis were consistent with partially penetrant autosomal recessive or polygenic inheritance. Simulated linkage indicated that there was a 58% chance of obtaining suggestive linkage with the available pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of the present study suggest that in English Springer Spaniels, IE segregates in a manner that is consistent with partially penetrant autosomal recessive inheritance (ie, a single major locus with modifying genes) or polygenic inheritance. Given enough families with accurate phenotypic information and available DNA, it should be possible to use genetic linkage analysis to identify chromosomal segments containing the causative gene or genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerundolo, Rosario</author><author>Lloyd, David H</author><author>Mcneil, Pauline E</author><author>Evans, Helen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An analysis of factors underlying hypotrichosis and alopecia in Irish Water  Spaniels in the United Kingdom.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>107-122</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>34645005</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-3164.2000.00180.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A survey on the occurrence of dermatoses in the Irish Water spaniel (IWS) was  carried out in the United Kingdom. A group of 20 dogs was selected and examined clinically. All dogs had a nonpruritic, noninflammatory, regionalized hair loss affecting the same areas of the body in males and females, although an initial cyclical pattern associated with the oestrus cycle was identified. Hormonal investigations showed features suggestive of an abnormality of steroidogenesis. Histopathology revealed features similar to canine recurrent flank alopecia (CRFA) and follicular dysplasia associated with abnormal melanization, as in colour dilution alopecia, although the clinical features did not correlate with those conditions. Dietary changes improved coat and skin quality in most of the cases in this series but the role of the diet was not investigated further. This study suggests that hair loss in IWS is influenced by dietary factors and sexual hormones. Abnormalities of the steroidogenic pathways may contribute to the severity of the condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Martin J</author><author>Biel, Miriam</author><author>Klumpp, Stephan</author><author>Schneider, Matthias</author><author>Kramer, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of the volumes of cranial cavities in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  with Chiari-like malformation and other brachycephalic dogs as measured via computed tomography.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>508-512</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19335107</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.70.4.508</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE-To measure the absolute and relative volumes of cranial vaults of  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and other brachycephalic dogs for the purpose of evaluating a possible association between the volume of the caudal fossa (fossa caudalis cerebri; CF) and existence of Chiari-like malformation (CLM) and syringohydromyelia in CKCSs. ANIMALS-40 CKCSs and 25 brachycephalic dogs. PROCEDURES-The intracranial vault of all dogs was evaluated via computed tomography followed by magnetic resonance imaging. Volumes of the CF and the rostral and medial fossa (fossa rostralis et medialis cerebri) were determined. The ratio of the absolute volumes was calculated as the volume index (VI). RESULTS-All CKCSs had cranial characteristics consistent with CLM. There were no significant differences between CKCSs and brachycephalic dogs with respect to the VI and absolute volumes of the CF and rostral and medial fossas. The CKCSs without syringohydromyelia (n = 26) had a median VI of 0.1842, and CKCSs with syringohydromyelia (14) had a median VI of 0.1805. The median VI of other brachycephalic dogs was 0.1864. The VI did not differ among these 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Results of this study suggested that descent of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum and the presence of syringohydromyelia in CKCSs are not necessarily associated with a volume reduction in the CF of the skull.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Occhiodoro, T</author><author>Anson, D S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isolation of the canine alpha-L-fucosidase cDNA and definition of the fucosidosis  mutation in English Springer Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</full-title></periodical><pages>271-274</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA, Complementary</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fucosidosis</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8661697</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s003359900081</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Fucosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of  alpha-L-fucosidase. A biochemically and clinically well characterized canine model of fucosidosis exists in a colony of English Springer Spaniels. To facilitate its use as a model for gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy in lysosomal storage disorders displaying neurological symptoms, isolation of the canine alpha-L-fucosidase cDNA was undertaken. Both the nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of canine fucosidase show high levels of identity with the human and rat sequences. Fucosidosis dogs were found to have a greatly reduced level of alpha-L-fucosidase mRNA when compared with normal dogs by Northern blot analysis. Direct PCR sequencing of products generated from cDNA demonstrated a 14-bp deletion in mRNA from affected dogs. This deletion creates a frameshift mutation and introduces a premature translation termination codon at amino acid position 152 and was shown to correspond to a deletion of the last 14 base pairs of exon 1 of the canine alpha-L-fucosidase gene. Rapid PCR-based screening for the mutation has now been performed on genomic DNA from dogs within the colony, enabling detection of both carriers and homozygotes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carrera, Inés</author><author>Dennis, Ruth</author><author>Mellor, Dominic J</author><author>Penderis, Jacques</author><author>Sullivan, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of magnetic resonance imaging for morphometric analysis of the caudal cranial  fossa in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>340-345</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skull Base</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19254145</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.70.3.340</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To perform morphometric analysis of the caudal cranial fossa in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs), to assess the relationship between caudal fossa dimensions and the frequency of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of occipital abnormalities in CKCSs (with and without syringomyelia), and to compare caudal cranial fossa measurements in CKCSs with measurements of 2 groups of mesaticephalic dogs. ANIMALS: 70 CKCSs and 80 mesaticephalic (control) dogs. PROCEDURES: Dogs were placed into 4 groups as follows: Labrador Retrievers (n = 40), spaniel-type dogs (40; English Springer Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels), CKCSs with syringomyelia (55), and CKCSs without syringomyelia (15). Multiple morphometric measurements (linear, angular, and area) were obtained from cranial midsagittalT2-weighted magnetic resonance images including the brain and cervical portion of the spinal cord. Several specific MRI findings were also recorded for CKCSs that appeared to affect the occipital bone and cervicomedullary junction. RESULTS: No significant difference was identified among breeds in control groups and between sexes in any of the groups for all morphometric measurements. Significant differences were identified in CKCSs, compared with mesaticephalic dogs, in the area of the caudal cranial fossa and for several linear measurements that reflected the length of the ventral aspect of the occipital bone. These differences were greater in CKCSs with syringomyelia. All CKCSs had abnormalities in occipital bone shape. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CKCSs had a shallower caudal cranial fossa and abnormalities of the occipital bone, compared with those of mesaticephalic dogs. These changes were more severe in CKCSs with syringomyelia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Downs, Louise M</author><author>Mellersh, Cathryn S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Intronic SINE insertion in FAM161A that causes exon-skipping is associated  with progressive retinal atrophy in Tibetan Spaniels and Tibetan Terriers.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e93990</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Alternative Splicing</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Genetic Diseases, Inborn</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Introns</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Insertional</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements</keyword><keyword>Transcription, Genetic</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24705771</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0093990</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) in dogs is characterised by the degeneration of  the photoreceptor cells of the retina, resulting in vision loss and eventually complete blindness. The condition affects more than 100 dog breeds and is known to be genetically heterogeneous between breeds. Around 19 mutations have now been identified that are associated with PRA in around 49 breeds, but for the majority of breeds the mutation(s) responsible have yet to be identified. Using genome-wide association with 22 Tibetan Spaniel PRA cases and 10 controls, we identified a novel PRA locus, PRA3, on CFA10 (p(raw) = 2.01 × 10(-5), p(genome) = 0.014), where a 3.8 Mb region was homozygous within 12 cases. Using targeted next generation sequencing, a short interspersed nuclear element insertion was identified near a splice acceptor site in an intron of a provocative gene, FAM161A. Analysis of mRNA from an affected dog revealed that the SINE causes exon skipping, resulting in a frame shift, leading to a downstream premature termination codon and possibly a truncated protein product. This mutation segregates with the disease in 22 out of 35 cases tested (63%). Of the PRA controls, none are homozygous for the mutation, 15% carry the mutation and 85% are homozygous wildtype. This mutation was also identified in Tibetan Terriers, although our results indicate that PRA is genetically heterogeneous in both Tibetan Spaniels and Tibetan Terriers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Joffe, D J</author><author>Allen, A L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ulcerative eosinophilic stomatitis in three Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>34-37</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eosinophilia</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Prednisone</keyword><keyword>Stomatitis</keyword><keyword>Ulcer</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>7820762</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-31-1-34</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Ulcerative eosinophilic stomatitis affecting three Cavalier King Charles spaniels  is described.

Medical therapy is recommended when erosions or tear film abnormalities are present. Stromal dystrophies documented in dogs appear to be a primary lipid deposition in various layers of the stroma, depending on the breed. Stromal dystrophies seldom lead to loss of vision, but vision loss has been observed in middle aged Airedale Terriers and aged Siberian Huskies. Treatment is usually unnecessary. The dog demonstrates two types of endothelial dystrophy, one of which (posterior polymorphous dystrophy in the American Cocker Spaniel) does not lead to corneal edema. Endothelial dystrophy observed in the Boston Terrier, Chihuahua, and other breeds is associated with progressive corneal edema, which can lead to bullous keratopathy and corneal erosions. Stromal and endothelial dystrophies, both of which are associated with rapid progression of corneal edema, occur rarely in the cat. Treatment of dystrophies with progressive corneal edema is symptomatic and palliative.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramsey, I K</author><author>Foster, A</author><author>McKay, J</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in two Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>372-373</pages><volume>140</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9133724</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.140.14.372</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davidson, M G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital cataracts in English cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>494</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>3420773</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.122.20.494-b</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mandigers, Paul</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Chiari-like malformation--syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel].</title><secondary-title>Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde</full-title></periodical><pages>746-750</pages><volume>134</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19911737</accession-num><language>dut</language><urls/><abstract>This article, which is based on the PhD thesis of Clare Rusbridge, is a review of  chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

Echocardiography has the potential to disclose early valvular changes, and the present prospective study was designed to investigate the occurrence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in young CKCS without heart murmurs, and to correlate the degree of MVP with the clinical status of the dogs by including CKCS with MVI as well. The study was based on blinded evaluations of echocardiographic recordings of mitral valves from 34 CKCS and 30 control dogs. Thirteen (87%) of 15 three-year-old CKCS without heart murmurs had MVP (2 total and 11 partial), as compared with 1 (7%) of 15 three-year-old normal Beagle dogs (P &lt; 0.0001), and none of 15 three-year-old normal Medium Size Poodles (P &lt; 0.0001). Of 19 CKCS with MVI, MVP was found in 84% of the entire group and in 100% of dogs with pulmonary congestion or edema. The occurrence of total MVP tended to be higher in the group with MVI (47%, 9/19), when compared with the younger CKCS without heart murmurs (13%, 2/15, P = 0.06). MVP was positively associated with excessive heart rate variability (P = 0.003). The radius of curvature of the anterior mitral valve leaflet in systole was significantly reduced in dogs with MVP when compared with those without (P &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, this study shows that CKCS at an early age have a high occurrence of MVP. This suggests: 1) A genetic predisposition of CKCS to MVP; and 2) That MVP is a pathogenetic factor in the development of mitral valvular insufficiency. Follow up studies may add further support to these proposals, and clarify whether echocardiography may be an aid in selecting CKCS for future breeding.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lees, G E</author><author>Helman, R G</author><author>Homco, L D</author><author>Millichamp, N J</author><author>Hunter, J F</author><author>Frey, M S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early diagnosis of familial nephropathy in English cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>189-195</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Basement Membrane</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heterozygote</keyword><keyword>Kidney Diseases</keyword><keyword>Kidney Glomerulus</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Proteinuria</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9590445</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-34-3-189</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Two litters of English cocker spaniels (ECSs) produced by familial nephropathy  (FN) carriers were evaluated to characterize the early features of this disease. Three puppies developed FN. Proteinuria, which began when these puppies were five-to-eight months old, was the first abnormality detected. Proteinuria persisted while each puppy's growth rate slowed, and renal function gradually deteriorated. The interval from onset of proteinuria to development of azotemia was two-to-nine months. Characteristic glomerular capillary basement membrane (GCBM) lesions were seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of renal biopsy specimens obtained during this interval. Ultrastructural GCBM lesions progressed substantially during the interval from biopsy to necropsy. However, routine light microscopic findings did not allow definitive diagnosis of FN in either biopsy or necropsy specimens. Detection of FN can be accomplished by screening at-risk ECSs for proteinuria. Renal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis in dogs for which proteinuria cannot be explained otherwise. Percutaneous needle biopsy specimens sufficient for TEM must be used to examine the GCBM to make a definitive diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bredal, W P</author><author>Gunnes, G</author><author>Vollset, I</author><author>Ulstein, T L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oral eosinophilic granuloma in three cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>499-504</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenal Cortex Hormones</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eosinophilic Granuloma</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mouth Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8912245</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.1996.tb01753.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Oral eosinophilic granuloma is a rare and enigmatic disease in dogs. The  clinical, haematological, cytological and histopathological features of three unrelated Cavalier King Charles spaniels with oral ulcers are presented. The disease was characterised by granuloma or plaque formation in the oral cavity. Common clinical signs were clearing the throat, swallowing problems, coughing during and after meals, reduced appetite and difficulty in eating. Haematological findings were not specific. Cytology was considered easier to perform than tissue biopsy due to friability of the tissue, but could not be used to confirm a granuloma diagnosis. The diagnosis of oral eosinophilic granuloma was verified histopathologically in each case. Response to glucocorticoid therapy varied, from complete remission to lack of any visible effect, leading to a guarded prognosis. The aetiology of the disease was not determined; however, the gross and microscopic morphologies of the lesions, their location and the response to corticosteroid therapy was suggestive of hypersensitivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caswell, Jeff L</author><author>Nykamp, Stephanie G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intradural vasculitis and hemorrhage in full sibling Welsh springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>137-139</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dura Mater</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hematoma, Subdural</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polyarteritis Nodosa</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>blood supply</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12650042</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Two, full sibling, Welsh springer spaniel presented at 8 and 18 mo of age with  rapidly progressive ataxia, recumbency, and pyrexia.

Heart rate variability was assessed by the natural logarithm of the variance of the R-R intervals for 20 consecutive beats obtained from electrocardiographic recordings. Twenty-two of the dogs were clinically normal and 59 had mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease. The severity of mitral regurgitation was evaluated by echocardiography and thoracic radiography. Heart rate variability was found to be reduced (P &lt; 0.001) among dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular dilatation and clinical signs of congestion. No significant differences in heart rate variability were found among normal dogs, dogs with only cardiac murmur, and dogs with echoradiographic evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and ventricular dilatation. Overall, an association was found between heart rate variability and left atrial to aortic root ration and left ventricular end diastolic diameters (r = 0.72 and 0.64, respectively, P &lt; 0.001), as well as heart and respiratory rate (r = 0.80 and 0.69, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Multiregression analysis showed that, in order of importance, heart rate, left atrial diameter and respiratory rate had significant effects on heart rate variability. Among these parameters, heart rate variability and left atrial diameter were found to be most efficient in separating decompensated dogs from compensated. It is concluded that heart rate variability may provide the clinician with valuable information when assessing the severity of mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Knowler, S P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hereditary aspects of occipital bone hypoplasia and syringomyelia (Chiari type I  malformation) in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>107-112</pages><volume>153</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12918827</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.153.4.107</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A database of over 1300 cavalier King Charles spaniels spanning 20 generations  was established by obtaining pedigree information from 45 dogs with syringomyelia secondary to occipital bone hypoplasia. These data were supplemented with published information from the breed club. The incidence of syringomyelia was very high in certain families and lines which had been extensively inbred. The affected dogs could be traced back to one bitch born in 1956 and the two offspring from her single litter. Four key dogs representing four major breeding lines consistently occurred within the individual pedigrees. If a dog had more than five of its eight great-grandparents descended from these four lines there was a greater chance of it having syringomyelia. The data from this preliminary study suggest that occipital bone hypoplasia is hereditary in the cavalier King Charles spaniel and that its inheritance is more likely to be autosomal recessive because both dam and sire must be inbred descendants from certain lines. However, the inheritance is more likely to be of variable penetrance or oligogenic than simple.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neurological diseases of the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>265-272</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epilepsy</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15971896</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2005.tb00319.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Several neurological syndromes have been described in Cavalier King Charles  spaniels and many of the conditions have similar clinical signs.

With these methods the number of glomeruli x 1000 per kidney appeared to be 502 +/- 213 and 515 +/- 230 respectively. The histological method appeared to be acceptable for the determination of the number of glomeruli in incomplete kidneys. The examined Cocker Spaniels consisted of 5 animals without renal problems for control and 21 animals with nephropathy: 12 of 1-2 years, 6 of 4-6 years and 3 of 9-10 years old dogs. As indication for the present number of nephrons the glomeruli were counted in bands of whole cortex with a width of 1 mm. The number of glomeruli per band of cortex in the nephropathic Cocker Spaniels (15.0 +/- 3.0) was not drastic lower than those of the normal Cockers (20.8 +/- 2.5) and of 7 normal adult dogs of different breeds (17.2 +/- 2.2). On pathological examination the nephropathic kidneys showed a membranoproliferative-sclerosing glomerulonephritis with extra-capillary reaction leading to glomerular obsolescence. The animals showed evident proteinuria and final renal insufficiency. It was concluded that the pathogenesis of the familial nephropathy in this breed will not be caused by cortical hypoplasia, but by a primary glomerulopathy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swenson, L</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Juneja, R K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship between parental cardiac status in Cavalier King Charles spaniels  and prevalence and severity of chronic valvular disease in offspring.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>2009-2012</pages><volume>208</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8707674</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between parental cardiac status in Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels and development of chronic valvular disease (CVD) in offspring. DESIGN: Historical cohort. ANIMALS: 54 female and 53 male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel offspring. PROCEDURE: 7 sires, selected on the basis of their liability to develop CVD, were screened for clinical signs of CVD and assigned to 1 of 3 groups (late, intermediate, and early onset of CVD). The mates of these sires (30 dams) were selected and classified likewise, and 107 offspring produced in 1988 from matings between these parents were screened for clinical signs of CVD at a mean age of 5.3 +/- 0.3 years. RESULTS: 55% of the offspring were free from clinical signs of CVD, whereas 45% had cardiac murmurs of low or moderate intensity. The proportion of offspring with heart murmurs and the intensity of murmurs were significantly greater with increased parental classification. More males than females had developed murmurs, and murmurs of moderate intensity also were more prevalent in males. Results of multiple-regression analysis indicated that mean parental classification and sex had significant effects on proportion of offspring with murmurs and their intensity. Additionally, age affected disease prevalence and severity, despite the narrow range in age of offspring examined. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Parental CVD status is an important factor influencing the probability of heart murmurs and their intensity in offspring. The results of this study indicate that CVD development is a polygenic threshold trait and that sex of the offspring influences threshold levels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Penderis, Jacques</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chiari-like malformation: a substantive health and welfare problem in the  Cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>133-134</pages><volume>195</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Hydrocephalus</keyword><keyword>Seizures</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23041179</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.08.026</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bloomfield, Lesley</author><author>Scott, Louise</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>English springer spaniel health survey.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>536</pages><volume>172</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Welfare</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Population Surveillance</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23687208</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.f3128</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skibild, E</author><author>Dahlgaard, K</author><author>Rajpurohit, Y</author><author>Smith, B F</author><author>Giger, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Haemolytic anaemia and exercise intolerance due to phosphofructokinase deficiency  in related springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>298-300</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Erythrocytes</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinase-1</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11440399</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2001.tb02043.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder  in dogs causing haemolytic crises and exertional myopathy. The clinical signs may be confused with those of recurrent immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. The deficiency has been commonly observed in field trial (working) English springer spaniels (ESSPs), but also in the conformation line of ESSPs in the USA over the past two decades. This report documents the first family of ESSPs found with PFK deficiency in Europe. Two related adult ESSPs in Denmark had intermittent signs of pigmenturia after exercise (hunting) and had evidence of a regenerative haemolytic anaemia. Based upon DNA sequencing data, both dogs had the previously described nonsense point mutation in the muscle-type PFK gene (delta2228G--&gt;A). Study of 17 related family members using a simple and accurate PFK-DNA test revealed one additional PFK-deficient dog (with minor exercise intolerance), nine carriers and seven normal (or 'clear') ESSPs. Recently, the authors have also identified PFK carriers and affected ESSPs in the UK. Screening for PFK deficiency is recommended for ESSPs with suspicious clinical signs and before using any for field trials or breeding in order to prevent the further spread of this hereditary disorder.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vermeersch, Katie</author><author>Van Ham, Luc</author><author>Caemaert, Jacques</author><author>Tshamala, Mulenda</author><author>Taeymans, Olivier</author><author>Bhatti, Sofie</author><author>Polis, Ingeborgh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suboccipital craniectomy, dorsal laminectomy of C1, durotomy and dural graft  placement as a treatment for syringohydromyelia with cerebellar tonsil herniation in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>355-360</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Belgium</keyword><keyword>Cervical Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Craniotomy</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Laminectomy</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15230838</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950X.2004.04051.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of the suboccipital  craniectomy and dorsal laminectomy of C1 with durotomy and placement of a dural graft for treatment of syringohydromyelia (SHM) because of cerebellar tonsil herniation in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). This technique is used with great success in human medicine. STUDY DESIGN: Four CKCS diagnosed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of SHM because of cerebellar tonsil herniation and not responsive to medical therapy underwent a suboccipital craniectomy and dorsal laminectomy of C1 (2 dogs) and of C1 and partial C2 (2 dogs) with durotomy and placement of a dural graft. Three dogs were evaluated neurologically 24 hours, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively and evaluations were compared with preoperative neurological examination. Repeat MRI took place 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Neurological examinations showed neither improvement nor progression of clinical signs 3 months postoperatively. MRI showed no regression of syrinx size 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Improvement was not seen. Given the progressive nature of the disorder, evaluation over a longer period of time is necessary to detect if progression has stopped. Some modification to the surgical technique is needed to accomplish the same results as in human medicine. A study of a larger population is needed to attain more reliable information. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Suboccipital craniectomy and dorsal laminectomy of C1 with durotomy and placement of a dural graft is a feasible technique in CKCS, but needs some modification to accomplish the same results as in human medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lees, G E</author><author>Wilson, P D</author><author>Helman, R G</author><author>Homco, L D</author><author>Frey, M S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glomerular ultrastructural findings similar to hereditary nephritis in 4 English  cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>80-85</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Basement Membrane</keyword><keyword>Capillaries</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Kidney Glomerulus</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Nephritis, Hereditary</keyword><keyword>blood supply</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9127294</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.1997.tb00077.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Renal disease affecting 3 male and 1 female English Cocker Spaniels was studied.  Clinical features of the disease included proteinuria and progressive deterioration of renal function. Dogs were 11 to 27 months old when euthanized because of severe chronic renal failure. Grossly, the renal cortices were thin. Light microscopic evaluation revealed diffuse glomerular disease characterized by mesangial thickening, glomerular fibrosis, periglomerular fibrosis, and glomerular obsolescence. Based on these clinical and pathologic features, familial nephropathy of English Cocker Spaniels was suspected despite the fact that the individual dogs were not closely related. On transmission electron microscopy, a distinctive ultrastructural lesion was observed in the glomerular basement membranes (GBM) of all dogs. The GBM exhibited extensive thickening, multilaminar splitting, and fragmentation. Electron dense deposits, suggestive of immunocomplex glomerular disease, were notably absent. A similar ultrastructural GBM lesion is found in human beings and Samoyeds with hereditary nephritis, diseases caused by mutations in the type IV collagen genes. Familial nephropathy in English Cocker Spaniels may be a form of hereditary nephritis caused by a mutation in one of the collagen IV genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Zongjie</author><author>Sun, Qing</author><author>Li, Yuhao</author><author>Guan, Zhixin</author><author>Wei, Jianchao</author><author>Li, Beibei</author><author>Liu, Ke</author><author>Shao, Donghua</author><author>Mi, Rongsheng</author><author>Liu, Haixia</author><author>Qiu, Yafeng</author><author>Ma, Zhiyong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis and Comparison of Gut Microbiome in Young Detection Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>872230</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35516435</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2022.872230</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The detection dogs are well-known for their excellent capabilities to sense  different kinds of smells, which can play an important role in completing various searching and rescuing missions. The recent studies have demonstrated that the excellent olfactory function of detection dogs might be related with the gut microbes via the bidirectional communications between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. In this study, the gut microbial communities of three types of breeds of detection dogs (Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, and German Shepherd) were studied and compared. The results revealed that the richness and the diversity of gut microbiome German Shepherd dogs were significantly higher than the Labrador Retriever dogs and the Springer Spaniel dogs. At the phylum level, the most predominant gut microbial communities of the detection dogs were comprised of Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Campilobacterota, and Actinobacteriota. At the genus level the most predominant gut microbial communities were comprised of Fusobacterium, Megamonas, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Haemophilus, Anaerobiospirillum, Helicobacter, Megasphaera, Peptoclostridium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus. However, the gut microbial communities of the three dogs group were also obviously different. The mean relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Megamonas, Bacteroides, and Phascolarctobacterium presented significant differences in the three groups. According to the portraits and characteristics of the gut microbiome in young detection dogs, multiple kinds of nutritional interventions could be applied to manipulate the gut microbiota, with the aim of improving the health states and the olfactory performances.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eriksson, A S</author><author>Järvinen, A K</author><author>Eklund, K K</author><author>Vuolteenaho, O J</author><author>Toivari, M H</author><author>Nieminen, M S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of age and body weight on neurohumoral variables in healthy Cavalier King  Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1818-1824</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrial Natriuretic Factor</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Cardiac Output</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Cyclic GMP</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Endothelin-1</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Natriuretic Peptide, Brain</keyword><keyword>Neurotransmitter Agents</keyword><keyword>Nitrites</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>Regression Analysis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11703030</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1818</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of age and body weight on several neurohumoral  variables that are commonly altered in heart failure in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. ANIMALS: 17 healthy privately owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 10 males and 7 females, ranging in age from 0.4 to 9.7 years, and ranging in body weight from 6.6 to 12.2 kg. PROCEDURE: The clinical condition of the dogs was evaluated by physical examination, thoracic radiography, and echocardiography. Plasma nitrate and nitrite (P-NN), N-terminal atrial natriuretic and brain natriuretic peptides (NT-ANP and BNP, respectively), endothelin (ET-1), urine cyclic guanosine monophosphate (U-cGMP), and urine nitrate and nitrite (U-NN) concentrations were analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of NT-ANP and P-NN increased significantly with age, but plasma NT-ANP and P-NN also correlated significantly, irrespective of age. A modest increase of left atrial size did not explain the increase of NT-ANP and P-NN with age. Concentration of ET-1 correlated positively with heart rate; heart rate did not change with age. Weight had a negative impact on NT-ANP, P-NN, and U-cGMP concentrations and left atrial relative size. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Age-matched controls are essential for evaluation of NT-ANP and P-NN concentrations and left atrial size. Weight may alter reference values of plasma NT-ANP, P-NN, and urine cGMP concentrations. Natriuretic peptides can be used as further evidence that heart failure exists. The increased plasma concentrations of NT-ANP (but not BNP) and P-NN with aging reflect neurohumoral physiologic changes that must be distinguished from pathologic changes in patients with heart failure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staaden, R V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cardiomyopathy of English cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1289-1292</pages><volume>178</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Myocardium</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1981</year></dates><accession-num>7275771</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In an English Cocker Spaniel kennel in which the adult population varied between  20 and 30, 11 dogs had evidence of cardiomyopathy over a 5-year period.

Results of serum protein electrophoresis, urine analysis, computed tomography of the thorax/abdomen, bone marrow aspiration and core biopsy, and splenic and mesenteric lymph node cytology were consistent with multiple myeloma. Endoscopically obtained gastrointestinal tract biopsies identified marked plasma cell infiltration within the duodenum, ileum and colon; immunohistochemistry showed positive labelling to MUM1 and Lambda confirming clonal plasma cell involvement. The dog entered complete clinical remission seven weeks after starting a melphalan/prednisolone protocol. The dog was euthanised 475 days after starting treatment due to cervical pain and collapse. At the time of euthanasia, blood work was not supportive of a relapse of multiple myeloma.

Several dog breeds are overrepresented in the disease population, suggesting that a genetic component is involved, although this is likely to be polygenic. Previous research has implicated CTLA4 as a potential susceptibility gene. CTLA4 is an important regulator of T cell function and polymorphisms/mutations in CTLA4 have been associated with a number of autoimmune phenotypes in both humans and rodent models of autoimmunity. The aim of the current study was to undertake a case:control association study of CTLA4 promotor polymorphisms in three dog breeds, cocker spaniels, springer spaniels and West Highland white terriers (WHWT). RESULTS: Polymorphisms in the CTLA4 promoter were determined by PCR and sequence-based typing. There were significant associations with three promoter haplotypes in cocker spaniels (p = 0.003). A series of SNPs were also associated with hypoadrenocorticism in cocker spaniels and springer spaniels, including polymorphisms in predicted NFAT and SP1 transcription factor binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that CTLA4 promotor polymorphisms are associated with this complex genetic disease and supports an immune mediated aetiopathogenesis of canine hypoadrenocorticism.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwochka, K W</author><author>Rademakers, A M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell proliferation kinetics of epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands of  cocker spaniels with idiopathic seborrhea.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1918-1922</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoradiography</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Seborrheic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epidermis</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hair</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sebaceous Glands</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1989</year></dates><accession-num>2533468</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cell proliferation kinetic values were established for the epidermis, hair  follicle epithelium, and sebaceous glands of 8 Cocker Spaniels with primary idiopathic seborrhea.

Cocker spaniels stopped work at a significantly younger age than Springer spaniels (p = 0.0003) or Labrador retrievers (p = 0.0407). There was no significant difference between the other major breeds. The majority of owners (54.3%) were satisfied with the working lifespan of their dog. Seventy per cent of dogs were retired, the three most prevalent reasons being lameness (25.2%), old age (23.7%) and deafness (7.8%). Forty-four dogs died (6.6%) and 158 (24%) were euthanised, with cancer (58%) being the most common reason. CONCLUSIONS: No work-related issues were identified and gundogs appear to have similar causes of mortality to the general canine population.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mason, K V</author><author>Halliwell, R E</author><author>McDougal, B J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of lichenoid-psoriasiform dermatosis of springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>897-901</pages><volume>189</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Seborrheic</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lichen Planus</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Psoriasis</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>2945806</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Three unrelated Springer Spaniels were examined because of chronic dermatitis.  Their ages at onset of clinical signs were 4, 5, and 18 months. The initial lesions consisted of erythematous papules and plaques, with corrugated surfaces in the ear canal and in the inguinal area. Later, papules, scale, and adherent keratin mounds developed inside the ear, in the inguinal area, around the mouth, eyes, and anus, and occasionally on the thoracic wall and the limbs. In one case, the nose was involved and there was accompanying depigmentation. The disease waxed and waned for the 10-month, 18-month and 3-year periods of observation, with various treatments proving unsuccessful. Corticosteroids at high doses and antibiotics appeared to mitigate the severity of the disease. Histopathologic interpretation enabled classification of the disease process within both psoriasiform and lichenoid tissue reactions. In view of the apparent breed predisposition and the gross and microscopic appearance of the lesions, it was proposed that the name for this disease be lichenoid-psoriasiform dermatosis of Springer Spaniels. This disease would be clinically classified as seborrhea and could be differentiated within this group by the presence of erythematous papules and plaques along with accurate histologic assessment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, B R</author><author>Johnstone, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An unusual myopathy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>119-121</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>16030892</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00480169.1982.34906</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A nine-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was examined because it could not  withdraw its tongue into its mouth and had difficulty eating and drinking.

American Cocker Spaniels with DCM were identified using echocardiography, and plasma was analyzed for taurine and carnitine concentrations. Each dog was randomly assigned to receive either taurine and carnitine supplementation or placebos. Echocardiograms and clinical examinations were repeated monthly for 4 months. During this period, the investigators and owners were blinded with respect to the treatment being administered. Each dog was weaned off its cardiovascular drugs (furosemide, digoxin, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) if an echocardiographic response was identified. At the 4-month time period, each investigator was asked to decide whether he or she thought his or her patient was receiving placebo or taurine/carnitine, based on presence or absence of clinical and echocardiographic improvement. Unblinding then occurred, and dogs receiving placebos were switched to taurine and carnitine supplementation and followed monthly for 4 additional months. All dogs were reexamined 6 months after starting supplementation; survival time and cause of death were recorded for each dog. Data from 3 dogs were not included because of multiple protocol violations. Each dog had a plasma taurine concentration &lt; 50 nmol/mL (mean +/- SD for the group 15 +/- 17 nmol/ mL) at baseline; normal range, 50-180 nmol/mL. The plasma taurine concentration did not exceed 50 nmol/mL at any time in the dogs receiving placebos (n = 5), but increased to 357 +/- 157 nmol/mL (range 140-621 nmol/mL) during taurine and carnitine supplementation (n = 11). Plasma carnitine concentration was within, only slightly below, or slightly above reported limits of normality at baseline (29 +/- 15 mumol/L); did not change during placebo administration; and increased significantly during supplementation (349 +/- 119 mumol/L; n = 11). Echocardiographic variables did not change during placebo administration. During supplementation, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and mitral valve E point-to-septal separation decreased significantly in both groups. Shortening fraction increased significantly but not into the normal range. Echocardiographic variables remained improved at 6 months. All dogs were successfully weaned off furosemide, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin once an echocardiographic response was identified. Nine of the dogs have died since the onset of the study in 1992. One dog died of recurrence of DCM and heart failure 31 months after starting supplementation; six dogs died of noncardiac causes. Two dogs developed degenerative mitral valve disease and died of complications of this disease. Dogs less than 10 years of age lived for 46 +/- 11 months, whereas dogs older than 10 years of age lived for 14 +/- 7 months. Two of the 11 dogs were alive at the time of publication, having survived for 3.5 and 4.5 years, respectively. We conclude that ACS with DCM are taurine-deficient and are responsive to taurine and carnitine supplementation. Whereas myocardial function did not return to normal in most dogs, it did improve enough to allow discontinuation of cardiovascular drug therapy and to maintain a normal quality of life for months to years.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bertola, Luca</author><author>Cappelleri, Andrea</author><author>Tomba, Raffaella Ma</author><author>Dotti, Elisa</author><author>Caniatti, Mario</author><author>Dall'Ara, Paola</author><author>Recordati, Camilla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vaccine-Associated Anaphylactic Shock in a Springer Spaniel Dog with  Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>34-38</pages><volume>194</volume><keywords><keyword>Anaphylaxis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Ventricles</keyword><keyword>Myocardium</keyword><keyword>Vaccines</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35577457</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2022.03.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 5-year-old female Springer Spaniel dog was submitted for necropsy after sudden  death following vaccination against Leptospira spp. Gross examination revealed a diffuse dark red discolouration of skeletal musculature, severe diffuse congestion of all the abdominal organs and a contracted spleen. Severe dilation and reduction in wall width was seen in the right ventricle and histological examination revealed multifocal replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by a large amount of fibrofatty tissue. Pathological changes were consistent with post-vaccinal anaphylactic shock in a dog with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a rare condition typical of Boxer dogs but not previously reported in Springer Spaniels.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histological features of chronic hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels. ANIMALS: Thirteen cases examined from 2003 to 2009. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were searched for American Cocker Spaniels with chronic liver diseases. History, physical examination, clinicopathologic features, hepatic ultrasonographic findings, hepatic histopathology, and immunohistochemistry were evaluated. RESULTS: The median age was 4.6 (1.9-10.7) years. Clinical signs included inappetence (11/13), ascites (11/13), lethargy (9/13), diarrhea (7/13), and melena (2/13). Only 1/13 dogs was jaundiced. Clinicopathological abnormalities were increased liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase: 9/12, aspartate aminotransferase: 7/10, alanine aminotransferase: 6/13, alkaline phosphatase: 6/13), increased total serum bile acid concentrations (10/12), and hypoalbuminemia (10/13). The liver had an irregular surface in all dogs and acquired portosystemic collaterals were verified in 11/13 dogs by abdominal ultrasound (2), laparoscopy (4), or both (5). Liver histology revealed severe fibrosis and cirrhosis in all cases, subdivided in lobular dissecting hepatitis (7), periportal fibrosis (1), micronodular cirrhosis (3), and macronocular cirrhosis (2). Inflammatory activity was low to mild. Immunohistochemical stains showed ductular proliferation. The median survival time was 913 (range: 63-1981) days. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels is clinically silent until an advanced stage and is associated with severe hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, extensive ductular/putative hepatic progenitor cell proliferation, portal hypertension, and acquired portosystemic collateral shunting, but relatively long survival times. Lobular dissecting hepatitis seems more prevalent than in previously reported cases from other countries.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weinstein, Nicole M</author><author>Boes, Katie M</author><author>Mauldin, Elizabeth</author><author>Rossmeisl, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is your diagnosis?

Affected dogs were part of approximately 500 American Cocker Spaniels examined from 1972 to 1976 in statewide survey clinics for inherited cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy. The dysplastic retina was observable ophthalmoscopically in dogs as young as 3 to 4 weeks and as old as 7 years. Ophthalmoscopic features varied, depending on whether the dysplastic foci were in the tapetal or non-tapetal portion of the fundus. Over the tapetum, dysplastic foci appeared as multiple small irregularities of diminished and altered tapetal reflectivity. In the non-tapetal fundus, dysplasia appeared as areas of decreased pigmentation. Blindness or other apparent visual deficits were not observed in affected dogs. Histologic examination of affected eyes revealed focal dysplasia limited to the retina and optic nerve. Abnormalities included localized areas of retinal folding, rosettes, and retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Pedigree analysis demonstrated that 71 of the 96 affected dogs were related and could be identified in an extended pedigree. A recessive mode of inheritance was suggested, because in 5 litters (born to 10 affected parents), all 23 progeny that lived were affected. A dominant or polygenic mode of inheritance could not be ruled out.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wrzosek, Marcin Adam</author><author>Banasik, Aleksandra Ewa</author><author>Owsińska-Schmidt, Karolina</author><author>Zimny, Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Syringomyelia Secondary to Chiari Malformation in  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel-A Preliminary Study.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36496926</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani12233405</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Syringomyelia secondary to Chiari-like malformation (so-called CM-SM syndrome) is  a common disorder in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) that is diagnosed using standard structural MRI, though imaging findings often do not correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a technique that defines subtle microstructural changes in the course of many brain and spinal cord diseases, that are not visible on standard MRI. The aim of the study was to identify the correlation between the presence of clinical symptoms and DTI parameters, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the spinal cord in the course of CM-SM. Study subjects included 18 dogs, CKCS with MRI-confirmed SM (SM group), and 12 CKCS dogs without SM (non-SM group). The SM group was divided into SM-symptomatic group (n = 8) and SM-asymptomatic group, n = 10). All dogs underwent same clinical and neurological assessment followed by MRI examination. All MRI studies were performed on a 1.5T MRI scanner. The MRI spine protocol included: transverse and sagittal T2-weighted images followed by DTI performed in the sagittal plane. The measurements of FA and ADC values were performed manually using the region of interest (ROI) method at the level of three intervertebral discs between C1 and C4. Notable differences in age and body weight were found. No significant differences in FA and ADC values between the SM and non-SM groups were found, but between non-SM, SM-asymptomatic and SM-symptomatic groups significant differences were found in ADC values in all three ROIs and in FA values in ROI-1 and ROI-3. SM-symptomatic dogs compared to non-SM, showed decreased FA value in ROI-1 and ROI-3 also increased ADC value in ROI-1, ROI-2 and ROI-3. SM-symptomatic dogs compared to SM-asymptomatic showed also decreased FA value in ROI-1 and ROI-3, and also increased ADC value in ROI-1, ROI-2 and ROI-3. The results suggest that the values of DTI parameters correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms in the course of CM-SM in animals. The use of DTI evaluation of CM-SM patients carries a potential value as a clinically relevant protocol for an objective assessment of the spinal cord.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Karlberg, B E</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Olsson, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in relation to severity of  mitral regurgitation in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>698-703</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrial Natriuretic Factor</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Regression Analysis</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>8067620</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Plasma concentration of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (ir-ANP) was  investigated in 83 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with variable severity of mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease (CVD). Severity of mitral incompetence was assessed by echocardiography. Significant differences in plasma concentrations of ir-ANP were not found between clinically normal dogs (New York Heart Association functional class O), dogs with only cardiac murmur (class I), and dogs with echocardiographic evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and ventricular dilatation (class II). Dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular dilatation and clinical signs of congestion (classes III and IV) were found to have significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased plasma concentration of ir-ANP. Overall, moderate degree of association was found between plasma concentration of ir-ANP and left atrial and left ventricular diameters (Pearson's r = 0.65, 0.60, respectively, P &lt; 0.001), as well as heart rate (r = 0.47, P &lt; 0.01). However, left atrial enlargement was found to have the predominant effect on plasma ir-ANP concentration. It is concluded that the plasma concentration of ir-ANP did not become markedly increased before decompensation of chronic mitral regurgitation associated with severe enlargement of the left atrium and ventricle in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tate, Nicole M</author><author>Minor, Katie M</author><author>Lulich, Jody P</author><author>Mickelson, James R</author><author>Berent, Allyson</author><author>Foster, Jonathan D</author><author>Petersen, Kasey H</author><author>Furrow, Eva</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple variants in XDH and MOCOS underlie xanthine urolithiasis in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Molecular genetics and metabolism reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular genetics and metabolism reports</full-title></periodical><pages>100792</pages><volume>29</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34584846</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ymgmr.2021.100792</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary xanthinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by missense  and loss of function variants in the xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) or molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) genes. The aim of this study was to uncover variants underlying risk for xanthinuria in dogs. Affected dogs included two Manchester Terriers, three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, an English Cocker Spaniel, a Dachshund, and a mixed-breed dog. Four putative causal variants were discovered: an XDH c.654G &gt; A splice site variant that results in skipping of exon 8 (mixed-breed dog), a MOCOS c.232G &gt; T splice site variant that results in skipping of exon 2 (Manchester Terriers), a MOCOS p.Leu46Pro missense variant (Dachshund), and a MOCOS p.Ala128Glyfs*30 frameshift variant that results in a premature stop codon (Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and English Cocker Spaniel). The two splice site variants suggest that the regions skipped are critical to the respective enzyme function, though protein misfolding is an alternative theory for loss of function. The MOCOS p.Leu46Pro variant has not been previously reported in human or other animal cases and provides novel data supporting this residue as critical to MOCOS function. All variants were present in the homozygous state in affected dogs, indicating an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Allele frequencies of these variants in breed-specific populations ranged from 0 to 0.18. In conclusion, multiple diverse variants appear to be responsible for hereditary xanthinuria in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shelton, G Diane</author><author>Minor, Katie M</author><author>Guo, Ling T</author><author>Thomas-Hollands, Alison</author><author>Walsh, Koranda A</author><author>Friedenberg, Steven G</author><author>Cullen, Jonah N</author><author>Mickelson, James R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An EHPB1L1 Nonsense Mutation Associated with Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia  and Polymyopathy in Labrador Retriever Littermates.</title><secondary-title>Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Dyserythropoietic, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Codon, Nonsense</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Myopathies, Structural, Congenital</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36011338</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/genes13081427</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In this report, we describe a novel genetic basis for congenital  dyserythropoietic anemia and polymyopathy in Labrador Retriever littermates characterized by incidental detection of marked microcytosis, inappropriate metarubricytosis, pelvic limb weakness and muscle atrophy. A similar syndrome has been described in English Springer Spaniel littermates with an early onset of anemia, megaesophagus, generalized muscle atrophy and cardiomyopathy. Muscle histopathology in both breeds showed distinctive pathological changes consistent with congenital polymyopathy. Using whole genome sequencing and mapping to the CanFam4 (Canis lupus familiaris reference assembly 4), a nonsense variant in the EHBP1L1 gene was identified in a homozygous form in the Labrador Retriever littermates. The mutation produces a premature stop codon that deletes approximately 90% of the protein. This variant was not present in the English Springer Spaniels. Currently, EHPB1L1 is described as critical to actin cytoskeletal organization and apical-directed transport in polarized epithelial cells, and through connections with Rab8 and a BIN1-dynamin complex generates membrane vesicles in the endocytic recycling compartment. Furthermore, EHBP1L1 knockout mice die early and develop severe anemia. The connection of EHBP1L1 to BIN1 and DMN2 functions is particularly interesting due to BIN1 and DMN2 mutations being causative in forms of centronuclear myopathy. This report, along with an independent study conducted by another group, are the first reports of an association of EHBP1L1 mutations with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and polymyopathy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karlstam, E</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Kvarat, C</author><author>Jönsson, L</author><author>Michaelsson, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pulmonary artery lesions in cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>166-167</pages><volume>147</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Thrombosis</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10975336</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.147.6.166</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Neill, D G</author><author>Mitchell, C E</author><author>Humphrey, J</author><author>Church, D B</author><author>Brodbelt, D C</author><author>Pegram, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiology of periodontal disease in dogs in the UK primary-care veterinary  setting.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>1051-1061</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Disease Susceptibility</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Periodontal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34374104</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13405</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Periodontal disease is a frequent diagnosis of dogs and can have  severe negative impacts on welfare. It was hypothesised that breeds with skull shapes that differ most in conformation from the moderate mesocephalic skull shape have higher odds of periodontal disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cohort study included a random sample of dogs under primary veterinary care in 2016 from the VetCompass Programme database. Risk factor analysis used random effects multivariable logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: The study included a random sample of 22,333 dogs. The 1-year period prevalence for diagnosis with periodontal disease was 12.52% (95% CI: 12.09 to 12.97). Eighteen breeds showed increased odds compared with crossbred dogs. Breeds with the highest odds included Toy Poodle (odds ratio 3.97, 95% confidence intervals 2.21 to 7.13), King Charles Spaniel (odds ratio 2.63, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 4.61), Greyhound (odds ratio 2.58, 95% confidence interval 1.75 to 3.80) and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (odds ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.85 to 3.09). Four breeds showed reduced odds compared with crossbreds. Brachycephalic breeds had 1.25 times the odds (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.42) of periodontal disease compared with mesocephalic breeds. Spaniel types had 1.63 times the odds (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 1.87) compared with non-spaniel types. Increasing adult bodyweight was associated with progressively decreasing odds of periodontal disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The high prevalence identified in this study highlights periodontal disease as a priority welfare concern for predisposed breeds. Veterinarians can use this information to promote improved dental care in predisposed dogs, especially as these dogs age.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saito, Akihiko</author><author>Iwashita, Hiroko</author><author>Kazama, Yoshiyuki</author><author>Wakaiki, Shinsuke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term vision outcomes and breed differences of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve  implantation in 132 eyes of 122 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>118-127</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma Drainage Implants</keyword><keyword>Intraocular Pressure</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Visual Acuity</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34581495</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12941</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term vision outcomes of Ahmed glaucoma valve  (AGV) implantation in dogs. PROCEDURES: The medical records of dogs that underwent AGV implantation from January 2010 to December 2019 were reviewed to assess the duration of post-surgical vision preservation (PVP). The relationship between PVP and the underlying cause of glaucoma, implant placement, and preoperative intraocular pressure was evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two eyes of 122 dogs (mean age, 8.3 ± 2.6 years) were included. The mean ± standard error of PVP for all eyes was 57.5 ± 3.9 months. PVP in the dogs with primary acute glaucoma and prior history of cataract surgery was 56.4 ± 4.7 and 59.3 ± 5.9 months, respectively (p = .712). The PVP of the Shiba Inu, American Cocker Spaniel, and other breeds was 63.1 ± 5.5, 33.7 ± 5.3, and 59.1 ± 6.3 months, respectively (p &lt; .05). The PVP in dogs with medial implantation was 61.9 ± 4.7 months, and in those with lateral implantation was 45.4 ± 6.4 months (p = .034). Among the 132 eyes investigated, 48 (36.4%) lost vision by the last follow-up, and 18 eyes retained vision for more than 5 years. Two of the total number of eyes retained their vision for more than 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The vision outcomes regarding the use of AGV for the management of canine glaucoma were favorable in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berman, Marissa</author><author>Soltero-Rivera, Maria</author><author>Scanlan, Amy J Fulton</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of Dental and Skeletal Malocclusions in Mesaticephalic and  Dolichocephalic Dogs-a Retrospective Study (2015-2018).</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary dentistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary dentistry</full-title></periodical><pages>8987564221141826</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36503325</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/08987564221141826</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Medical records of dogs with dolico- or mesaticephalic conformation who were  presented to a private veterinary referral dental practice with malocclusion of the deciduous or permanent dentition were retrospectively reviewed from a 3-year period (2015-2018). Records were evaluated to determine the type(s) of malocclusions and 198 dogs were evaluated with permanent malocclusions. Of the dogs with deciduous malocclusions, 45 (60%) had variations of a MAL1, 28 (38%) had a MAL2, 13 (17.6%) had a MAL3, and four (5.4%) had a MAL4, with 19 (26%) having more than one type of malocclusion. Poodles, Labrador Retrievers, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels consisted of 37 (50%) of the dogs with deciduous malocclusions. Fifty-five (74%) dogs proceeded with interceptive orthodontics. Of the dogs with permanent malocclusions, 128 (65%) had a variant of a MAL1, 60 (30%) had a MAL2, 75 (38%) had a MAL3, and 11 (5.6%) had a MAL4, with a MAL1 occurring concurrently with 49 (82%) MAL2 cases. The most common type of MAL1 was linguoversion of one or both mandibular canine teeth in 92 (72%) dogs. The five most commonly affected breeds with permanent malocclusions were Poodles, Labrador Retrievers, Chihuahuas, Pit Bull Terriers, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Overall, 39 (18%) dogs presented with malocclusions observed in this study were associated with the Poodle breed and 20 (9%) dogs were associated with the Labrador Retriever breed. This trend among Poodle mixes and Labrador Retrievers supports a familial pattern to malocclusions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petersen, Tanja</author><author>Proschowsky, Helle Friis</author><author>Hardon, Tommy</author><author>Rasch, Søren Nyhuus</author><author>Fredholm, Merete</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and heritability of distichiasis in the English Cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>11</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26401339</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-015-0024-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Canine distichiasis is a well-known cause of ocular irritation and  excessive lacrimation (secretion of tears) in the dog. The term distichiasis originates from the Greek words di and stichos meaning two and rows, respectively, and as the name implies, the condition is characterized by an additional row of cilia, which erupts on the eyelid margin. Many purebred dogs are known to be predisposed to the condition, with many affected individuals within the populations. Even though the problem is widespread, the exact mode of inheritance and the heredity has not been studied extensively. However, some degree of genetic influence has been assumed, due to the high incidences within specific breeds. In the present study we have examined a cohort of English Cocker spaniels in Denmark to determine the prevalence and heritability of the disease. RESULTS: Data from English Cocker spaniels with an ECVO eye examination registered between 2004-2013 were included in the study. The number of dogs examined during this period was 799, and the prevalence of distichiasis within this cohort was estimated at 49.31 % with a gender predisposition that females are more likely to get distichiasis than males. The correlation between the distichiasis status of the parents and their offspring revealed a significant association between the breeding combination of the parents and the occurrence of distichiasis in the offspring (p &lt;0.0001). A relative risk (RR) ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 demonstrates that offspring of two affected parents are more likely to be affected than offspring descending from either one or two unaffected parents. The heritability was estimated to be moderate to high, i.e., 0.22 to 0.51. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of distichiasis in English Cocker spaniels from Denmark, examined in 2004-2013 was shown to be extremely high. The relative risk of developing the disease was 1.3 and 1.8 for offspring of one or two affected parents respectively. This together with the moderate to high heritability of the condition indicates that selective breeding could be used to reduce the incidence of distichiasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yates, Georgina H</author><author>Sanchez-Vazquez, Manuel J</author><author>Dunlop, Morag M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bilateral renal agenesis in two cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>672</pages><volume>160</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17496284</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.160.19.672-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Littlewood, J D</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author><author>Palmer, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neuronal storage disease in English springer spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>86-87</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain Diseases, Metabolic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year></dates><accession-num>6829151</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.112.4.86</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larkin, M</author><author>Loughin, C</author><author>Marino, D</author><author>Dewey, C</author><author>Umbaugh, S</author><author>Sackman, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Medical infrared thermal imaging of syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>137</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Thermography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32410627</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-020-02354-y</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Medical infrared thermal imaging (MITI) is a non-invasive imaging  modality gaining popularity in the veterinary field. An infrared camera captures emission of heat and creates a color map in the form of a thermogram. Topical heat emission is influenced by localized disease processes as a result of autonomic nervous system imbalance. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of using thermography to identify changes in thermographic patterns associated with syringomyelia (SM) presence or absence in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with Chiari-like Malformation (CLM). RESULTS: In CKCS with CLM, MITI was most accurate at a texture distance of 6. Optimizing imaging feature sets produced a highest accuracy of 69.9% (95% CI: 59.5-79.0%), with 81.3% sensitivity and 57.8% specificity for identifying the presence of syringomyelia. CONCLUSION: Thermographic image analysis is a successful non-invasive, diagnostic test that can be used to screen for syringomyelia presence in a CKCS with CLM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Houlton, J E</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitochondrial myopathy in the Sussex spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>206</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Acidosis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitochondria, Muscle</keyword><keyword>Muscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>Physical Exertion</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1980</year></dates><accession-num>7361423</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.106.9.206-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parker, W M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostatic abscess in a Springer Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>18-19</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Abscess</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Diseases</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1975</year></dates><accession-num>1109760</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dain, A R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intersexuality in a Cocker spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of reproduction and fertility</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of reproduction and fertility</full-title></periodical><pages>365-371</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Genitalia, Male</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Karyotyping</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mullerian Ducts</keyword><keyword>Sex Determination Analysis</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>Wolffian Ducts</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1974</year></dates><accession-num>4472157</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1530/jrf.0.0390365</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Buskirk, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The lens epithelium of American cocker spaniels with inherited and non-inherited  lens cataracts.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>237-242</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Lens, Crystalline</keyword><keyword>Mitosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1977</year></dates><accession-num>860096</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The normal lens epithelium of American cocker spaniels exhibits a monolayer of  cells similar to that seen in other animals.

ANIMAL STUDIED: Seventy-three American Cocker Spaniels and six normal Beagles. PROCEDURES: Sera were collected from 73 ACSs, including those with normal lenses and those with cataracts, or uveitis. Fractionated, normal Beagle lens βH-crystallins were separated by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. The separated lens βH-crystallins were used on immunoblots as sentinel substrates against which the ACS sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against βH-crystallins. RESULTS: Sera from approximately two-thirds of study animals contained antibodies to some βH-crystallin polypeptides, but reactivity varied among patients. Contrary to some hypotheses, serum antibodies to groups of βH-crystallins did not relate to the stages of cataract. However, detailed analysis by two-dimensional immunoblotting and mass spectrometry showed that three spots originating from βA1-crystallin were detected only in sera from cataract patients. CONCLUSION: Serum antibodies to βA1-crystallin may be associated with the development of cataract.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bexfield, Nick</author><author>Myatt, Peter</author><author>Gajanayake, Isuru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Study into sterile neutrophilic-macrophagic lymphadenitis in the English springer  spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>104</pages><volume>177</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26206973</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.h3989</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cork, L C</author><author>Griffin, J W</author><author>Munnell, J F</author><author>Lorenz, M D</author><author>Adams, R J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>209-221</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypoglossal Nerve</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Motor Neurons</keyword><keyword>Muscles</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Neurofibrils</keyword><keyword>Neuromuscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Diseases</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>innervation</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year></dates><accession-num>438862</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/00005072-197905000-00002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy is a newly recognized motor neuron  disease occurring in Brittany Spaniels. The clinical manifestations, pattern of inheritance, electrodiagnostic findings, and muscle biopsies have features in common with human spinal muscular atrophy. Neuropathological examination discloses some loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. Many of the surviving motor neurons have neurofibrillary swellings in proximal axons, an abnormality similar to that which occurs early in the course of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These axonal swellings are filled with maloriented skeins of neurofilaments. Since the proteins comprising neurofilaments are carried by slow axonal transport, their accumulation within axons suggest that the swellings may result from impaired slow transport, a hypothesis that can be tested in affected Brittany Spaniels. Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy is a new genetic, clinical, and pathological entity, and, at present, it appears to be the best currently available animal model of motor neuron disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kirchhoff, A</author><author>Kobe, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Generalized ceroid lipofuscinosis in cocker spaniels].</title><secondary-title>Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

This patterning in the coat can be modified by other factors to produce the attractive phenotypes termed 'ticked' and 'roan' that describe the presence of flecks of color that vary in distribution and intensity within otherwise 'clear' white markings. The appearance of the pigment in the white patterning caused by ticking and roaning intensifies in the weeks after birth. We applied genome-wide association to compare English Cocker Spaniels of roan phenotype (N = 34) with parti-color (non-roan) English Cocker Spaniels (N = 9) and identified an associated locus on CFA 38, CFA38:11 057 040 (P(raw)  = 8.9 × 10(-10) , P(genome) = 2.7 × 10(-5) ). A local case-control association in English Springer Spaniels comparing 11 ticked and six clear dogs identified indicative association with a different haplotype, CFA38:11 122 467G&gt;T (P(raw)  = 1.7 × 10(-5) ) and CFA38:11 124 294A&gt;C (P(raw)  = 1.7 × 10(-5) ). We characterize three haplotypes in Spaniels according to their putative functional variant profiles at CFA38:11 111 286C&gt;T (missense), CFA38:11 131 841-11 143 239DUP.insTTAA (using strongly linked marker CFA38:11 143 243C&gt;T) and CFA38:11 156 425T&gt;C (splice site). In Spaniels, the haplotypes work as an allelic series including alleles (t, recessive clear; T, dominant ticked/parti-color; and T(R) , incomplete dominant roan) to control the appearance of pigmented spots or flecks in otherwise white areas of the canine coat. In Spaniels the associated haplotypes are t (CCT), T (TCC) and T(R) (TTT) for SNP markers on CFA38 at 11 111 286C&gt;T, 11 143 243C&gt;T and 11 156 425T&gt;C respectively. It is likely that other alleles exist in this series and together the haplotypes result in a complex range of patterning that is only visible when dogs have white patterning resulting from the epistatic gene Micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (the S-locus).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parzefall, B</author><author>De Decker, S</author><author>Carvalho, S</author><author>Terry, R</author><author>Leach, J</author><author>Smith, K C</author><author>Lara-Garcia, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Axial Multicentric Osteosarcoma in an English Cocker Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1720-1725</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27519845</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14555</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bardagí, M</author><author>Montoliu, P</author><author>Ferrer, L</author><author>Fondevila, D</author><author>Pumarola, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acral mutilation syndrome in a miniature pinscher.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>235-238</pages><volume>144</volume><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Euthanasia, Animal</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foot</keyword><keyword>Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies</keyword><keyword>Self Mutilation</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20961556</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2010.08.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Acral mutilation syndrome (AMS) is a rare canine hereditary sensory neuropathy  that results in progressive mutilation of the distal extremities and which has been reported only in German short-haired pointers, English pointers, English springer spaniels and French spaniels.

ANIMALS: 76 clinically healthy CKCSs and 24 control dogs. PROCEDURE: All dogs underwent echocardiographic examination; various hemostatic, hematologic, and biochemical variables were evaluated in blood. The CKCSs were allocated to 1 of 3 groups on the basis of MR severity. In 8 control dogs and 8 CKCSs, plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimer analysis was performed. RESULTS: Compared with control dogs, plasma fibrinogen concentration was higher in all CKCSs and related to left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left atrial-to-aortic root ratio among all CKCSs. The activated partial thromboplastin times and plasma D-dimer concentration were similar among the 4 groups. Plasma vWF concentration was lower in CKCSs with moderate to severe MR, compared with that of CKCSs with no MR and control dogs. There was a relationship between plasma vWF concentration and platelet function in CKCSs but not in control dogs. In 4 CKCSs with moderate to severe MR and low plasma vWF concentration, amounts of vWF high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs) were low. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In CKCSs, MR appeared to be associated with a low plasma vWF concentration and likely a loss of vWF HMWMs (possibly through their destruction via shear stress to the blood). The importance of the changes in plasma fibrinogen concentration and the thromboembolic risk in dogs with MR remain to be investigated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hill, S L</author><author>Shelton, G D</author><author>Lenehan, T M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myotonia in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>506-509</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electric Stimulation</keyword><keyword>Electromyography</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscle Fibers, Skeletal</keyword><keyword>Muscle Relaxation</keyword><keyword>Muscle, Skeletal</keyword><keyword>Myotonia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8581546</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-31-6-506</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 16-week-old, male cocker spaniel suffering from pelvic-limb &quot;bunny hopping&quot; as  well as rigidity, spasticity, and ataxia in all limbs was evaluated.

Improving our understanding of these correlates also has implications for prescribed energy requirements in dogs. PA was measured using accelerometry in 62 dogs from two common breeds (Labrador retrievers and Cocker spaniels). Five potential correlates (age, sex, breed, neuter status, body condition score) were tested for associations with total volume of PA, light-moderate intensity PA, vigorous intensity PA and sedentary behaviour. Age and breed were associated with total volume of PA, light-moderate intensity PA and sedentary behaviour in the final models. Age was associated with vigorous intensity PA. The final models explained 60%, 40%, 63% and 44% of variance in total volume of PA, light-moderate intensity PA, vigorous intensity PA and sedentary behaviour, respectively. These results should improve understanding of the variation in energy requirements of dogs, as well as the development of age and breed-specific diets and the prevention and treatment of canine obesity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schiborra, F</author><author>Scudder, C J</author><author>Littler, R M</author><author>Lamb, C R</author><author>McConnell, J F</author><author>Maddox, T W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CT findings in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in five dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29577303</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12833</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is a rare disease in dogs.

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of cavalier King Charles spaniels diagnosed with middle ear effusion and treated with tympanostomy tubes placement between 2012 and 2014 was performed. Outcome was assessed based on a telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-two tympanostomy tubes were successfully placed in the tympanic membrane in 12 cavalier King Charles spaniels under video-otoscopic guidance using a rigid endoscope and grasping forceps. Follow-up based on an owner questionnaire was available for 11/12 dogs. Subjective improvement in hearing was observed in 9/11 dogs with three dogs achieving normal hearing, according to the owners, and six demonstrating partial improvements. Out of 11 dogs, 10 dogs were reported with improved quality of life. Pruritus of the ears resolved in 3/9 dogs. Clinical signs recurred in four dogs because of tube dislodgement. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Video-otoscopic tympanostomy tube placement appeared to be indicated as a treatment for middle ear effusion in cavalier King Charles spaniels. It subjectively improved hearing, pruritus and quality of life in most dogs. The tympanostomy tubes dislodged in some cases, leading to recurrence of clinical signs, which were effectively eliminated by replacement of a fresh tube.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Zuilen, C D</author><author>Nickel, R F</author><author>van Dijk, T H</author><author>Reijngoud, D J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Xanthinuria in a family of Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The veterinary quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The veterinary quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>172-174</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypoxanthine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Renal Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Urethral Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Uric Acid</keyword><keyword>Urinary Calculi</keyword><keyword>Xanthine</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9413115</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01652176.1997.9694766</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Xanthine calculi were found in a 7-month-old male Cavalier King Charles spaniel  with urethral obstruction and renal insufficiency.

Previous medical history included a high-grade soft tissue spindle cell sarcoma removed from the cranial sternal region one year before. On presentation at the referral hospital, the dog was tachypneic and dyspneic. The heart rhythm was regular and there was a soft left-sided systolic murmur. Echocardiography identified the presence of a mass significantly occluding left heart inflow, with no other lesions identified. Thoracic radiographs documented a localized alveolar pattern within the left caudal lung lobe. The size of the heart and pulmonary vessels were within normal limits, indicating a non-cardiogenic alveolar pattern. Given the clinical presentation of dyspnea and high index of suspicion of intra-cardiac neoplasia, the dog was considered to have a grave prognosis and therefore euthanized. Post-mortem gross and histopathologic examination revealed the presence of a metastatic osteosarcoma tumor thrombus in the left atrium and pulmonary vein, metastatic osteosarcoma infiltrating the myocardium, lungs, the uveal tract of the right eye, and both adrenal glands. Whitney grade II myxomatous changes were noted on the mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets. This report describes an unusual intra-cardiac tumor thrombus in a dog presenting with dyspnea. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels presenting with dyspnea often raise suspicion for myxomatous mitral valve disease. However, as demonstrated in this case, other more unusual causes of dyspnea should also be considered in the absence of classic clinical findings.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macdougall, D F</author><author>Nash, A S</author><author>Cattanach, B M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control scheme for familial nephropathy in cocker spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>134</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Kidney Failure, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>3435608</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.121.6.134-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reilly, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surgical removal of a jugular aneurysm in a spaniel cross dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>37029515</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13599</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Hendricks, Anke</author><author>Phillips, Jennifer A</author><author>Brodbelt, Dave C</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Loeffler, Anette</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-neoplastic anal sac disorders in UK dogs: Epidemiology and management aspects  of a research-neglected syndrome.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>e203</pages><volume>189</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33645764</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vetr.203</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Non-neoplastic anal sac disorders (ASD) are frequent presentations  for dogs in primary-care practice but evidence-based information on disease occurrence and risk is sparse. This study estimates prevalence, breed associations and other risk factors as well as reporting on clinical management. METHODS: A cohort study of dogs attending VetCompass practices between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Of 104,212 dogs attending 110 UK practices, the 1-year period prevalence of ASD was 4.40% (95% CI: 4.22-4.57). Compared to crossbreds, six breeds showed increased odds of ASD (Cavalier King Charles spaniel, King Charles spaniel, Cockapoo, Shih-tzu, Bichon Frise and Cocker spaniel), and six breeds showed reduced odds (Labrador Retriever, Border collie, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Lurcher, German Shepherd Dog and Boxer). Brachycephalic types had 2.6 times the odds for ASD compared to dolichocephalic types. Medication prescribed for ASD included antimicrobials (n = 480, 20.24%) and analgesics (n = 284, 11.97%). Anal sacculectomy was performed in under 1% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence, strong breed predispositions and evidence of severity suggested from the antimicrobial and analgesic therapies combined with current substantial knowledge gaps identify ASD as a key research-neglected syndrome in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yun, Seongjin</author><author>Lee, Dabin</author><author>Kang, Seonmi</author><author>Kim, Dong Wook</author><author>Kim, Youngsam</author><author>Cho, Je-Yoel</author><author>Seo, Kangmoon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proteomic analysis of aqueous humor in canine primary angle-closure glaucoma in  American Cocker Spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>520-532</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aqueous Humor</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Angle-Closure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34558166</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12937</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To analyze proteomic profiles of the aqueous humor (AH) of canines  with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and identify associated protein alterations. ANIMALS STUDIED: Six American Cocker Spaniels with PACG and six American Cocker Spaniels without ocular diseases. METHODS: Aqueous humor samples were collected from six American Cocker Spaniels with PACG at Seoul National University, VMTH, and six healthy Cocker Spaniels without ocular disease at Irion Animal Hospital. For the PACG group, AH samples were obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis prior to glaucoma treatment. For the AH control group, AH samples were collected from patients anesthetized for other reasons. Total AH protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. AH protein samples were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Raw MS spectra were processed using MaxQuant software 30, and the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using ClueGO. RESULTS: The AH protein concentration in the PACG group (10.49 ± 17.98 µg/µl) was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.45 ± 0.11 µg/µl; p &lt; .05). A total of 758 proteins were identified in the AH. Several proteins both significantly increased (n = 69) and decreased (n = 252) in the PACG group compared to those in the control group. GO enrichment analysis showed that the &quot;response to wounding,&quot; &quot;negative regulation of endopeptidase activity,&quot; and &quot;cell growth&quot; pathways were the most enriched terms in the PACG group compared to the control group. The top 5 proteins that were significantly increased in the AH of the PACG group were secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), peptidoglycan recognition proteins 2 (PGLYRP2), tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (YWHAE), maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM), and vimentin (VIM). CONCLUSIONS: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the proteomic data showed that proteins and pathways related to inflammation were significantly upregulated in the various stage of PACG. Proteomic analysis of the AH from the PACG may provide valuable insights into PACG pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Minatel, L</author><author>Underwood, S C</author><author>Carfagnini, J C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ceroid-lipofuscinosis in a Cocker Spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>488-490</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Euthanasia</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Intestines</keyword><keyword>Muscle, Smooth, Vascular</keyword><keyword>Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses</keyword><keyword>Neurons</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11055878</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1354/vp.37-5-488</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A neurodegenerative storage disease identified as ceroid-lipofuscinosis by light,  fluorescence, and electron microscopic examinations was diagnosed in a 4-year-old female Cocker Spaniel dog with progressive ataxia and proprioceptive deficits.

However, there are no reports to describe CC in canine patients with epilepsy. Three client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with DRE are included in this case series. In presurgical evaluations, an apparent epileptogenic zone was not detected in each dog and CC was conducted. Total CC was performed in one dog, whereas the other two received partial CC. One dog recovered from surgery without any complications, but died suddenly by an unknown cause at 10 h after surgery. For the other two dogs, postoperative evaluations including seizure outcomes, complications, and quality of life of the dogs and owners were assessed for at least 12 months. Both dogs showed a remarkable decrease in seizure frequency (averaged 80.3% reduction) and severity after surgery. The antiseizure medications were maintained, and not only the mentation and activity of the dogs, but also the quality of life of dogs and owners were improved postoperatively. Although technical improvement and more large-scale studies are needed, CC is a treatment option for dogs with DRE in veterinary medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, R P</author><author>Watson, A D</author><author>Smith, J</author><author>Cooper, B J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myasthenia in Springer Spaniel littermates.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>641-647</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Myasthenia Gravis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1975</year></dates><accession-num>1207073</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.1975.tb05790.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrade, Larissa Rocha</author><author>Caceres, Amanda Manara</author><author>Trecenti, Anelize de Souza</author><author>Borges, Alexandre Secorun</author><author>Oliveira-Filho, Jose Paes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allele frequency of nonsense mutation responsible for hereditary nephropathy in  English cocker spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and animal science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and animal science</full-title></periodical><pages>100114</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32734115</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vas.2020.100114</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary nephropathy is a primary progressive glomerular disease in dogs  associated with the c.115A&gt;T mutation in the COL4A4 gene in English cocker spaniel (ECS) dogs. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Hereditary nephropathy has been described in this breed since the late 1940s. To date, there are no data on the prevalence of this disease in Brazil, so the aim of this study was to evaluate the allelic frequency of this mutation in ECS dogs in this country. The DNA samples were purified from blood samples or buccal swabs from 221 ECS dogs. Fragments of the DNA containing the mutation were amplified by PCR and submitted to direct gene sequencing. The allele frequency of the mutation was 0.9%. The presence of the mutation in the ECS dog population in Brazil reveals the importance of performing the genotyping tests in these dogs as a method of diagnosing the disease and identifying heterozygous animals, aiming to reduce clinical cases of disease through mating.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Genain, M-A</author><author>Barbosa, A</author><author>Herrtage, M</author><author>Watson, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical relevance of radiographic linear branching mineral opacities in the  canine liver.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>432-437</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biliary Tract Diseases</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Minerals</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29210091</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12797</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence, clinical significance and breed  distribution of linear branching mineralisation superimposed on the hepatic radiographic silhouette in dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of radiographs or ultrasound images of dogs showing branching mineralisation in the liver. RESULTS: Over the 30-year review period, 17 cases were identified and the mineralisation had a predominantly ventral distribution. Seven of the 17 were cavalier King Charles spaniels, and four of the total 17 dogs were diagnosed with hepatobiliary system disease. Five dogs had repeat radiographs, of which four showed no change in the pattern and one developed the pattern 6 years after being diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis. Serum calcium concentrations were normal in all patients. Liver enzymes were markedly elevated only in the dog diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis. Histology performed on three patients showed no convincing evidence of primary liver disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Branching mineralisation in the liver parenchyma is a rare finding in dogs with little or no clinical significance and cavalier King Charles spaniels may be predisposed. Biopsy of the liver of affected dogs with no clinical or clinicopathological evidence of liver disease is unlikely to be helpful in these cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oliver, J A C</author><author>Ekiri, A</author><author>Mellersh, C S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and progression of pectinate ligament dysplasia in the Welsh springer  spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>416-421</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Gonioscopy</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27251455</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12497</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of pectinate ligament dysplasia in a  large group of Welsh springer spaniels; to investigate associations between pectinate ligament dysplasia and age, sex and intraocular pressure and between intraocular pressure and age and sex; and to investigate progression of pectinate ligament dysplasia in individual dogs. METHODS: In a prospective study, gonioscopy was performed in both eyes of 227 Welsh springer spaniels and intraocular pressure measured by rebound tonometry. Eyes were classified as &quot;unaffected&quot; if 0% of the iridocorneal angle was affected with pectinate ligament dysplasia (grade 0), &quot;mildly affected&quot; if &lt;20% was affected (grade 1), &quot;moderately affected&quot; if 20 to 90% was affected (grade 2) and &quot;severely affected&quot; if &gt;90% was affected (grade 3). In a retrospective study, progression of pectinate ligament dysplasia over time was investigated for 65 dogs. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine of 227 dogs (61·2%) were affected by pectinate ligament dysplasia (grades 1 to 3) and 82/227 (36·2%) were moderately or severely affected. There was a significant association between pectinate ligament dysplasia and age. There were no associations between pectinate ligament dysplasia and intraocular pressure or pectinate ligament dysplasia and sex. Thirty-five of 65 dogs (53·8%) demonstrated progression of pectinate ligament dysplasia. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Prevalence of pectinate ligament dysplasia was high despite widespread screening and selection against the condition. Our data indicate that gonioscopic features of pectinate ligament dysplasia can progress in the Welsh springer spaniel. Dogs deemed unaffected at an early age may subsequently be diagnosed with pectinate ligament dysplasia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stark, D M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hip dysplasia in a clumber spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>207</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hip Dislocation, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Hip Dysplasia, Canine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year></dates><accession-num>6836910</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.112.9.207-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, K A</author><author>Allan, G S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Panosteitis in a cocker spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>153-155</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Osteitis</keyword><keyword>Osteosclerosis</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Radius</keyword><keyword>Ulna</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>7126064</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.1982.tb00629.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 12-month-old, desexed female Cocker Spaniel had intermittent bilateral foreleg  lameness which was due to panosteitis of the radius and ulna.

A colony of affected dogs was established, and breeding studies incriminated an inherited basis for the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Angus, John C</author><author>Lichtensteiger, Carol</author><author>Campbell, Karen L</author><author>Schaeffer, David J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed variations in histopathologic features of chronic severe otitis externa in  dogs: 80 cases (1995-2001).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1000-1006</pages><volume>221</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Cluster Analysis</keyword><keyword>Discriminant Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear Canal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Osteotomy</keyword><keyword>Otitis Externa</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12369678</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2002.221.1000</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To compare pathologic changes of the horizontal ear canal associated  with chronic severe otitis externa between Cocker Spaniels and dogs of other breeds. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 80 dogs with severe otitis externa that required total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed for breed, sex, and age at time of surgery. Histologic specimens from the horizontal ear canal were evaluated by a single examiner for overall tissue response pattern and scored for sebaceous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland ectasia, fibrosis, pigment-laden macrophages, and osseous metaplasia. RESULTS: 48 of 80 (60%) dogs were Cocker Spaniels. Thirty-five of 48 (72.9%) Cocker Spaniels had a predominately ceruminous tissue response pattern; only 9 of 32 (28.1 %) dogs of other breeds had the same pattern. Other breeds most commonly had a pattern dominated by fibrosis (n = 13 [40.6%]); fibrosis was the predominant pattern in only 4 of 48 (8.3%) Cocker Spaniels. Discriminant analysis and K-means clustering of 4 histopathologic criteria correctly classified 75% of the dogs as Cocker Spaniels or all other breeds. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cocker Spaniels are at increased risk for chronic severe otitis externa requiring total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy, indicating that earlier and more aggressive management of the primary otitis externa and secondary inflammation is warranted in this breed. Cocker Spaniels with chronic severe otitis externa have distinct differences in pathologic characteristics of the horizontal ear canal, compared with other breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, M A J</author><author>Jenkins, G</author><author>Dean, B L</author><author>O'Neill, T M</author><author>Macdonald, N J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of breed as a risk factor for humeral condylar fracture in skeletally  immature dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>374-380</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32323333</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13144</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of breed as a risk factor associated with  humeral condylar fracture in skeletally immature dogs in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of dogs under 12 months of age that were presented with humeral condylar fracture to three specialist referral centres between 2015 and 2018. Data retrieved from medical records included breed, age, gender, neuter status, affected limb, fracture configuration and aetiology of the fracture. Breed population percentages were compared with those recorded by the UK Kennel Club. RESULTS: Of the 115 dogs with 118 fractures, French bulldogs (41%) and English springer spaniels (15%) were overrepresented: humeral condylar fractures were more commonly diagnosed in French bulldogs (odds ratio = 5.86) and English springer spaniels (odds ratio = 5.66) compared with mixed-breed dogs. Lateral condylar fractures occurred in 70% of cases, with medial condylar fractures and Y/T fractures accounting for 9% and 21%, respectively. Median age at the time of fracture was 4 months (range 2 to 10 months). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: French bulldogs and English springer spaniels were identified as being at potentially increased risk of humeral condylar fracture in skeletally immature dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>PULLIG, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inheritance of whorls in cocker spaniels; a preliminary report.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>239-242</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetics</keyword><keyword>Heredity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1950</year></dates><accession-num>14794885</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a106138</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Villamizar-Martinez, Lenin A</author><author>Villegas, Cristian M</author><author>Gioso, Marco A</author><author>Reiter, Alexander M</author><author>Patricio, Geni C</author><author>Pinto, Ana C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphologic and Morphometric Description of the Temporomandibular Joint in the  Domestic Dog Using Computed Tomography.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary dentistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary dentistry</full-title></periodical><pages>75-82</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Mandible</keyword><keyword>Temporal Bone</keyword><keyword>Temporomandibular Joint</keyword><keyword>Temporomandibular Joint Disorders</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>28326983</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0898756416660008</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in the domestic dog is a synovial joint with 2  articular surfaces, the mandibular fossa of the squamous portion of the temporal bone and the articular head of the condylar process of the mandible. Although different diagnostic imaging techniques have been used to study the TMJ in dogs, morphologic and morphometric studies based on computed tomography (CT) are scarce. The purpose of the present study was to describe the morphologic and morphometric features of the TMJ in domestic dogs using CT. Width and depth of the mandibular fossa and 2 different angles between the mandibular fossa and the condylar process were measured in 96 TMJs of 48 dogs of different breeds (Labrador retriever, German shepherd, cocker spaniel, boxer, English bulldog, pug, shih tzu, and Cavalier King Charles spaniel). Temporomandibular joint conformation differed between breeds. Mid- and small-sized dogs had mandibular fossae that were more shallow, less developed retroarticular processes, and irregularly shaped condylar processes. The TMJs were more congruent in large dogs, presenting with deeper mandibular fossae, prominent retroarticular processes, and more uniform condylar processes. The measurements proposed in this study demonstrated 3 different morphologic conformations for the TMJ in the dogs of this study.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jäger, Kathrin</author><author>Steinborn, Päivi</author><author>Weider, Karola</author><author>Wohlsein, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Cutaneous infection with Orthopoxvirus bovis in a German Spaniel].</title><secondary-title>Tierarztliche Praxis.

Clinically, the  dog showed papular to ulcerative lesions on the nasal planum and on the tongue. Hematological, bacteriological and mycological examinations did not contribute any evidence for the etiology of the lesions. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a proliferative dermatitis and folliculitis with hydropic degeneration of keratinocytes and cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies. Cowpox virus antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy showed pox virus particles in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. DNA of Orthopoxvirus bovis was identified by polymerase chain reaction. Consequently, in dogs with papular to ulcerative lesions in the face or on the tongue, infection with cowpoxvirus should be considered as an etiological differential diagnosis. Infected dogs represent a potential risk of infection for humans and other animals with close contact.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zur, G</author><author>Lifshitz, B</author><author>Bdolah-Abram, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The association between the signalment, common causes of canine otitis externa  and pathogens.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>254-258</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Infections</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Externa</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21539570</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2011.01058.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether associations exist between pathogens, allergies,  conformational abnormalities, endocrinopathies and signalment in canine otitis externa (OE). METHODS: Medical records of 149 dogs which met predetermined inclusion criteria were evaluated retrospectively. Correlations between pathogens and the presence of allergy, endocrinopathy, conformational abnormalities and signalment were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: The shar-pei, German shepherd and cocker spaniel breeds were over-represented compared with the hospital's breed distribution (P&lt;0·001). German shepherd dogs and cocker spaniels were statistically more prone to infection with rod-shaped organisms and Labrador retrievers less than other breeds (P=0·034). Almost all dogs that were older than five years when diagnosed with OE had cocci (P=0·01) and also had higher levels of rods (P=0·028). The incidence of rods was higher in endocrinopathies (P=0·004), while that of Malassezia spp. tended to be higher in allergies (P=0·098). There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for all the other parameters examined. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: OE infection is usually not influenced by primary causes or predisposing factors. Endocrinopathies may be followed by a more severe otitis, however. OE may be more severe when it affects older dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rossanese, M</author><author>Pivetta, M</author><author>Pereira, N</author><author>Burrow, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital pleuroperitoneal hernia presenting as gastrothorax in five cavalier  King Charles spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>701-704</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Laparotomy</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Respiration Disorders</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>29708274</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12846</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Five cavalier King Charles spaniels were examined for acute onset of respiratory  distress. Thoracic radiographs demonstrated diaphragmatic hernia and tension gastrothorax, visible as a distended stomach occupying the left caudal thoracic cavity. Exploratory midline coeliotomy confirmed congenital pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic hernia with herniation and dilatation of the stomach. The hernia configuration was consistent in all cases, with a defect affecting the left diaphragmatic crus. Congenital pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic hernia is a rare condition caused by a defect in the dorsolateral diaphragm. Defects of the left crus of the diaphragm could result in the herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity with possible subsequent tension gastrothorax. Cavalier King Charles spaniels may have a predisposition to this condition. Tension gastrothorax is an acute life-threatening consequence of gastric herniation through a diaphragmatic defect that must be promptly recognised and surgically treated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, H Z</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Constantino-Casas, F</author><author>Jeffery, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histopathological investigation of syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles  spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>192-201</pages><volume>146</volume><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ependyma</keyword><keyword>Neurons</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Wallerian Degeneration</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21889166</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.07.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Syringomyelia (SM) in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) is identified  commonly on magnetic resonance images and is sometimes associated with clinical signs of pain and cervical hyperaesthesia. However, the mechanism by which SM develops in this breed has not been fully elucidated and the associated effects on spinal cord structure have not been reported previously. The aims of this study were to describe changes found in the spinal cord of CKCSs, to compare findings between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and to determine whether syrinx formation was associated with tissue destruction. Anomalies of the central canal were found in all specimens and many dogs had grossly visible fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord. Prominent microscopical findings were spongy degenerative changes associated with neuronal necrosis and Wallerian degeneration. The ependyma was discontinuous in many specimens, notably in symptomatic individuals, and there was evidence of angiogenesis and fibrous tissue proliferation around blood vessels adjacent to syrinx cavities. Compared with two different samples of the normal dog population, dogs with syrinxes had significantly less grey matter, although this decrease was associated with generalized loss of spinal cord area. Therefore, SM is associated with degenerative changes in the spinal cord and may develop through primary disruption of ependymal integrity followed by vascular hypertrophy and proliferation. Glial and fibrous proliferation appears to be associated with expression of clinical signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hezzell, M J</author><author>Dennis, S G</author><author>Humm, K</author><author>Agee, L</author><author>Boswood, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationships between heart rate and age, bodyweight and breed in 10,849 dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>318-324</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23662951</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12079</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate relationships between heart rate and clinical variables  in healthy dogs and dogs examined at a referral hospital. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the electronic patient records of a first opinion group (5000 healthy dogs) and a referral hospital (5849 dogs). Univariable and multi-variable general linear models were used to assess associations between heart rate and clinical characteristics. Separate multi-variable models were constructed for first opinion and referral populations. RESULTS: In healthy dogs, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P&lt;0.001) but was higher in Chihuahuas. The mean difference in heart rate between a 5 and 55 kg dog was 10.5 beats per minute. In dogs presenting to a referral hospital, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P&lt;0.001) and the following breeds; border collie, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, springer spaniel and West Highland white terrier and positively associated with age, admitting service (emergency and critical care, emergency first opinion and cardiology) and the following breeds; Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier and Yorkshire terrier.

ANIMALS: One hundred thirty-four English Cocker Spaniels (12 with ARHN, 8 obligate carriers, and 114 others), 3 mixed breed dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN), and 7 other dogs without hereditary nephropathy were included. METHODS: Diagnosis of ARHN was based on transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to compare COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA concentrations in the renal cortex from ARHN-affected English Cocker Spaniels, XLHN-affected dogs, and dogs without hereditary nephropathy. The entire coding region of COL4A4 was sequenced in 2 ARHN-affected dogs, 2 obligate carriers, 2 English Cocker Spaniels of unknown status, and 2 healthy mixed breed dogs. The exon containing the mutation was sequenced for all 134 English Cocker Spaniels. RESULTS: Quantitative real time RT-PCR implicated COL4A4 as the gene harboring the mutation, and sequencing identified a single nucleotide substitution at base 115 as the cause of ARHN in English Cocker Spaniels. This mutation, which causes a premature stop codon in exon 3 of COL4A4, was segregated with clinical status in all affected dogs and obligate carriers. The mutation also was identified in 39 of 114 other English Cocker Spaniels with previously unknown status. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The cause of this disease has been identified, and use of a test for the mutation will permit eradication of ARHN in the English Cocker Spaniel.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Neill, D G</author><author>Brodbelt, D C</author><author>Keddy, A</author><author>Church, D B</author><author>Sanchez, R F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Keratoconjunctivitis sicca in dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK: an  epidemiological study.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>636-645</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epidemiologic Studies</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34134171</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13382</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency and breed-related risk factors for  keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in dogs under UK primary veterinary care. METHODS: Analysis of cohort electronic patient record data through the VetCompass Programme. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 1456 KCS cases overall from 363,898 dogs [prevalence 0.40%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.42] and 430 incident cases during 2013 (1-year incidence risk 0.12%, 95% CI 0.11-0.13). Compared with crossbreds, breeds with the highest odds ratio (aOR) for KCS included American cocker spaniel (aOR 52.33: 95% CI 30.65-89.37), English bulldog (aOR 37.95: 95% CI 26.54-54.28), pug (aOR 22.09: 95% CI 15.15-32.2) and Lhasa apso (aOR 21.58: 95% CI 16.29-28.57). Conversely, Labrador retrievers (aOR 0.23: 95% CI 0.1-0.52) and border collie (aOR 0.30: 95% CI 0.11-0.82) had reduced odds. Brachycephalic dogs had 3.63 (95% CI 3.24-4.07) times odds compared to mesocephalics. Spaniels had 3.03 (95% CI 2.69-3.40) times odds compared to non-spaniels. Dogs weighing at or above the mean bodyweight for breed/sex had 1.25 (95% CI 1.12-1.39) times odds compared to body weights below. Advancing age was strongly associated with increased odds. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative tear tests are recommended within yearly health examinations for breeds with evidence of predisposition to KCS and might also be considered in the future within eye testing for breeding in predisposed breeds. Breed predisposition to KCS suggests that breeding strategies could aim to reduce extremes of facial conformation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Markby, G R</author><author>Macrae, V E</author><author>Corcoran, B M</author><author>Summers, K M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative transcriptomic profiling of myxomatous mitral valve disease in the  cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>350</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32967675</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-020-02542-w</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Almost all elderly dogs develop myxomatous mitral valve disease by  the end of their life, but the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) has a heightened susceptibility, frequently resulting in death at a young age and suggesting that there is a genetic component to the condition in this breed. Transcriptional profiling can reveal the impact of genetic variation through differences in gene expression levels. The aim of this study was to determine whether expression patterns were different in mitral valves showing myxomatous degeneration from CKCS dogs compared to valves from non-CKCS dogs. RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in three groups of canine valves resulted in distinct separation of normal valves, diseased valves from CKCS and diseased valves from other breeds; the latter were more similar to the normal valves than were the valves from CKCS. Gene expression patterns in diseased valves from CKCS dogs were quite different from those in the valves from other dogs, both affected and normal. Patterns in all diseased valves (from CKCS and other breeds) were also somewhat different from normal non-diseased samples. Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed enrichment in GO terms relating to cardiac development and function and to calcium signalling canonical pathway in the genes down-regulated in the diseased valves from CKCS, compared to normal valves and to diseased valves from other breeds. F2 (prothrombin) (CKCS diseased valves compared to normal) and MEF2C pathway activation (CKCS diseased valves compared to non-CKCS diseased valves) had the strongest association with the gene changes. A large number of genes that were differentially expressed in the CKCS diseased valves compared with normal valves and diseased valves from other breeds were associated with cardiomyocytes including CASQ2, TNNI3 and RYR2. CONCLUSION: Transcriptomic profiling identified gene expression changes in CKCS diseased valves that were not present in age and disease severity-matched non-CKCS valves. These genes are associated with cardiomyocytes, coagulation and extra-cellular matrix remodelling. Identification of genes that vary in the CKCS will allow exploration of genetic variation to understand the aetiology of the disease in this breed, and ultimately development of breeding strategies to eliminate this disease from the breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez Villamil, Carlos</author><author>Phillips, Andrew S J</author><author>Pegram, Camilla L</author><author>O'Neill, Dan G</author><author>Meeson, Richard L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of breed on canine humeral condylar fracture configuration, surgical  management, and outcome.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>639-647</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fracture Fixation, Internal</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32311154</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vsu.13432</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence, configuration, risk factors, fixation  methods and outcomes after repair of humeral condylar fractures (HCF) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective nested cohort study. SAMPLE POPULATION: One hundred twelve dogs. METHODS: Medical records of dogs referred between January 2010 and August 2018 were searched for HCF. Demographics, fracture configuration, repair, and complications were obtained from medical records. Radiographs were assessed for fracture reduction, implant positioning, and bone healing. Short-term radiographic and clinical outcomes, and long-term owner-assessed outcome was determined. Associations between these variables were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Dogs with HCF represented 112 of 43 325 (0.26%, 95% CI 0.22-0.31) referrals. French bulldogs and spaniel breeds were predisposed to HCF (P &lt; .02). French bulldogs were 6.58 times (95% CI 1.62-26.7) more likely than other breeds to have a medial HCF (P = .008). Epicondylar plate fixation was associated with reduced complications compared with lag screws and Kirschner wires (P = .009). Lameness was scored as 1 of 5 (median) in the 85 dogs with initial follow-up (median 6 weeks) after HCF repair. Outcome was considered excellent in 26 of 31 dogs with long-term follow-up (median 36 months). CONCLUSION: French bulldogs and spaniels were predisposed to HCF, and medial HCF were more common in French bulldogs. Epicondylar plate fixation was associated with reduced complications. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: French bulldogs are predisposed to HCF, including medial HCF. Epicondylar plate fixation is recommended over other epicondylar fixation methods to reduce complications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dor, C</author><author>Gajanayake, I</author><author>Kortum, A</author><author>Day, M J</author><author>Tappin, S</author><author>Harris, B</author><author>Battersby, I</author><author>Walker, D</author><author>Glanemann, B</author><author>Myatt, P</author><author>Dunning, M</author><author>Bexfield, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterisation and outcome of idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis in 64  English springer spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>551-558</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes</keyword><keyword>Lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31317549</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13052</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To describe the history, clinicopathological abnormalities,  diagnostic imaging findings, lymph node cytological/histological appearance, treatment and outcome of English springer spaniels diagnosed with idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective UK-based multicentre study, 64 dogs were recruited from 10 referral centres, 32 first-opinion practices and three histopathology/cytology laboratories, between 2010 and 2016. RESULTS: The median age at presentation was 6 years (range: 0.17 to 11.75). Neutered females were frequently affected. Pyrexia (83.8%), peripheral lymphadenomegaly (78.4%), dermatological lesions (72.9%), lethargy (67.6%), hyporexia (54%), diarrhoea (29.7%), coughing (24.3%), epistaxis, sneezing or nasal discharge (21.6%), ocular signs (21.6%) and vomiting (16.2%) were reported in dogs for which the history and physical examination records were available. Popliteal (45.3%), superficial cervical (35.9%) and submandibular (37.5%) lymphadenomegaly were frequently reported. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed non-specific changes. When undertaken, testing for infectious diseases was negative in all cases. Lymph node cytology, histopathology or both demonstrated mixed inflammatory (27%), pyogranulomatous (24%), neutrophilic (20%) or granulomatous (11%) lymphadenitis. Treatment details were available for 38 dogs, with 34 receiving prednisolone for a median duration of 15 weeks (range: 1 to 28 weeks). A good to excellent clinical response was reported in all but one case. Ten dogs relapsed after discontinuing prednisolone. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy and pyrexia in English springer spaniels. The characteristics of the disease, absence of identifiable infectious aetiology and response to glucocorticoid therapy suggest an immune-mediated aetiology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lederer, R</author><author>Bennett, D</author><author>Parkin, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survey of tail injuries sustained by working gundogs and terriers in Scotland.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>451</pages><volume>174</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Scotland</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tail</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24706392</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.102041</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Working dog owners in Scotland were invited to take part in an internet survey  regarding the 2010/2011 shooting season, which was designed to estimate the prevalence of tail injuries; assess the risk of tail injuries in docked and undocked working dogs; and identify risk factors for owner-reported tail injuries. Of 2860 working dogs, 13.5 per cent sustained at least one tail injury during the 2010/2011 shooting season. Undocked spaniels and hunt point retrievers (HPRs) were at greatest risk of tail injury with 56.6 per cent of undocked spaniels and 38.5 per cent of undocked HPRs sustaining at least one tail injury during the season. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of tail injury in dogs with tails docked by one-third, half or shorter. To prevent one tail injury in one shooting season, between two and 18 spaniels or HPRs would need to be docked as puppies. The authors believe that this work provides the best available evidence on which to base a consultation for changes to the legislation on tail docking in working dogs in Scotland. Docking the tails of HPRs and spaniels by one-third would significantly decrease the risk of tail injury sustained while working in these breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Joyce, Hannah</author><author>Burmeister, Louise M</author><author>Wright, Hattie</author><author>Fleming, Lorraine</author><author>Oliver, James A C</author><author>Mellersh, Cathryn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a variant in NDP associated with X-linked retinal dysplasia in  the English cocker spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0251071</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blindness</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genes, X-Linked</keyword><keyword>Genetic Diseases, X-Linked</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins</keyword><keyword>Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Retinal Detachment</keyword><keyword>Retinal Dysplasia</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33945575</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0251071</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: Three related male English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) were reported to be  congenitally blind. Examination of one of these revealed complete retinal detachment. A presumptive diagnosis of retinal dysplasia (RD) was provided and pedigree analysis was suggestive of an X-linked mode of inheritance. We sought to investigate the genetic basis of RD in this family of ECS. METHODS: Following whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the one remaining male RD-affected ECS, two distinct investigative approaches were employed: a candidate gene approach and a whole genome approach. In the candidate gene approach, COL9A2, COL9A3, NHEJ1, RS1 and NDP genes were investigated based on their known associations with RD and retinal detachment in dogs and humans. In the whole genome approach, affected WGS was compared with 814 unaffected canids to identify candidate variants, which were filtered based on appropriate segregation and predicted pathogenic effects followed by subsequent investigation of gene function. Candidate variants were tested for appropriate segregation in the ECS family and association with disease was assessed using samples from a total of 180 ECS. RESULTS: The same variant in NDP (c.653_654insC, p.Met114Hisfs*16) that was predicted to result in 15 aberrant amino acids before a premature stop in norrin protein, was identified independently by both approaches and was shown to segregate appropriately within the ECS family. Association of this variant with X-linked RD was significant (P = 0.0056). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we report a variant associated with canine X-linked RD. NDP variants are already known to cause X-linked RD, along with other abnormalities, in human Norrie disease. Thus, the dog may serve as a useful large animal model for research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mankowska, M</author><author>Krzeminska, P</author><author>Graczyk, M</author><author>Switonski, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Confirmation that a deletion in the POMC gene is associated with body weight of  Labrador Retriever dogs.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>116-118</pages><volume>112</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Pro-Opiomelanocortin</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28235700</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.02.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 14-bp deletion present in the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene of Labrador and  Flat Coat Retrievers (FCR), but absent in POMC of other breeds, disrupts the β-MSH and β-endorphin coding sequences. This deletion was recently reported as strongly associated with increased body weight and obesity. We searched for this mutation in a cohort of 272 dogs, representing four breeds with a known predisposition to obesity (Labrador and Golden Retrievers, Beagle, and Cocker Spaniel) and, as expected, we found it only in Labradors. Further, we confirmed the association between the deletion variant and body weight of Labradors but not with a 5-point body condition score (BCS). We suspect that the deletion variant in our cohort may act as a recessive allele, unlike the previous study, which suggested its additive effect.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hyun, Changbaig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitral valve prolapse in Cavalier King Charles spaniel: a review and case study.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>67-73</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diuretics</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enalapril</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Furosemide</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15785126</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 5 year-old spayed female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was presented after a 3-  to 5-day onset of severe respiratory distress.

A comprehensive diagnostic investigation revealed a midsystolic click sound on cardiac auscultation, signs of left sided cardiac enlargement in ECG and thoracic radiography, mitral valvular leaflet protrusion into left the atrium, decreased E-point-to septal separation (EPSS) and mitral regurgitated flow in echocardiography, all of which are characteristic signs of mitral valvular prolapse. After intensive care with diuretics [corrected] and a vasodilator with oxygen supplement, the condition of the dog was stabilized.

Diagnostic tests revealed the structure was immediately caudal to the vagina and compatible with a cyst. Surgical excision was required for resolution of clinical signs. Histology confirmed the structure was a cyst. The exact origin is unknown; however, the variety of lining epithelia, including sections with mucin production, and a well-differentiated smooth muscle layer, were most consistent with development from the lower hindgut or urogenital sinus during embryonic growth. The histologic and anatomical similarities with human retrorectal cystic hamartomas were key in establishing the diagnosis of a perineal cystic hamartoma. Following removal, constipation resolved, and the cyst did not recur.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Short, Andrea D</author><author>Boag, Alisdair</author><author>Catchpole, Brian</author><author>Kennedy, Lorna J</author><author>Massey, Jonathan</author><author>Rothwell, Simon</author><author>Husebye, Eystein</author><author>Ollier, Bill</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A candidate gene analysis of canine hypoadrenocorticism in 3 dog breeds.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>807-820</pages><volume>104</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenal Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genetic Association Studies</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Annotation</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23997205</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/est051</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine hypoadrenocorticism is believed to be an immune-related condition. It is  rare in the overall dog population but shows a breed-related predisposition with Standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs having a greater prevalence of the condition. It shares many similarities with human primary adrenal insufficiency and is believed to be a naturally occurring, spontaneous model for the human condition. Short haplotype blocks and low levels of linkage disequilibrium in the human genome mean that the identification of genetic contributors to the condition requires large sample numbers. Pedigree dogs have high linkage disequilibrium and long haplotypes within a breed, increasing the potential of identifying novel genes that contribute to canine genetic disease. We investigated 222 SNPs from 42 genes that have been associated or may be implicated in human Addison's disease. We conducted case-control analyses in 3 pedigree dog breeds (Labrador retriever: affected n = 30, unaffected = 76; Cocker Spaniel: affected n = 19, unaffected = 53; Springer spaniel: affected n = 26, unaffected = 46) and identified 8 associated alleles in genes COL4A4, OSBPL9, CTLA4, PTPN22, and STXBP5 in 3 pedigree breeds. Association with immune response genes PTPN22 and CTLA4 in certain breeds suggests an underlying immunopathogenesis of the disease. These results suggest that canine hypoadrenocorticism could be a useful model for studying comparative genetics relevant to human Addison's disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tauro, A</author><author>Talbot, C E</author><author>Pratt, J N J</author><author>Boydell, I P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suspected mitochondrial myopathy in a springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>396-397</pages><volume>163</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dietary Supplements</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitochondrial Myopathies</keyword><keyword>Ubiquinone</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18820330</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.163.13.396</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Ji-Hey</author><author>Kim, Dae-Yong</author><author>Yoon, Jung-hee</author><author>Kim, Wan Hee</author><author>Kweon, Oh-kyeong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cerebellar vermian hypoplasia in a Cocker Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>215-217</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cerebellar Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18487946</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4142/jvs.2008.9.2.215</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An eight-week-old female Cocker Spaniel was presented with ataxia, dysmetria and  intention tremor.

The VHS was measured using a right lateral view in twenty-eight normal dogs and fifteen dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease. The mean ± SD (standard deviation) VHS was 10.6 ± 0.2 vertebrae (v) in the normal dogs, which differs significantly from the mean VHS of 9.7 ± 0.5 v in Buchanan's original study with dogs of various breeds. The VHS in the dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease was 11.9 ± 1.1 v.

Pathology results from immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex, which is similar to that seen in the human Addison's disease. Both the canine and human diseases have similar clinical presentation, with the diagnosis based on performing a dynamic adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. MHC class II has previously been associated with the human and canine diseases. In the current study, we conducted an MHC class II association study in eight breeds of dog with diagnoses of hypoadrenocorticism. We demonstrated significant differences in dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) haplotype frequencies in six of these breeds: Cocker spaniel, Springer spaniel, Labrador, West Highland white terrier (WHWT), Bearded collie, and Standard poodle. In the Springer spaniel, the DLA-DRB1*015:01--DQA1*006:01--DQB1*023:01 haplotype was significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 5.14) and showed a similar trend in the Cocker spaniel. This haplotype is related to one associated with hypoadrenocorticism in the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever. Similar haplotypes shared between breeds were demonstrated, with DLA-DRB1*001:01--DQA1*001:01--DQB1*002:01 more prevalent in both affected Labrador (p = 0.0002, OR = 3.06) and WHWT (p = 0.01, OR = 2.11). Other haplotypes that have not previously been associated with the disease were identified. The inter-breed differences in DLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to canine hypoadrenocorticism could represent divergent aetiologies. This could have implications for clinical diagnosis and future comparative studies. Alternatively, it may suggest that the gene of interest is closely linked to the MHC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dickson, D</author><author>Shave, R</author><author>Rishniw, M</author><author>Harris, J</author><author>Patteson, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reference intervals for transthoracic echocardiography in the English springer  spaniel: a prospective, longitudinal study.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>520-528</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27492994</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12536</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To establish transthoracic echocardiographic reference intervals in  adult English springer spaniel dogs. METHODS: Forty-two healthy adult English springer spaniels were prospectively recruited from a general practice population in the UK. Animals were examined twice, at least 12 months apart, to exclude dogs with progressive cardiac disease. Reference intervals were calculated using Box-Cox transformations and specific variables were depicted within an expert consensus range. Relationships of body mass, age and heart rate with cardiac structure and function were examined and functional assessments were compared with previous reports. Reference intervals were compared against published ratiometric indices and allometric scaling models. RESULTS: Thirty-nine dogs contributed to create the reference intervals. Significant relationships with bodyweight, age and heart rate were detected, although low coefficients of determination were found. Fractional shortening values were lower than has been reported in many breeds but Simpson-derived ejection fractions were similar to previously published breed-specific values. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Breed-specific reference intervals are reported allowing for more appropriate interpretation of echocardiographic assessments in the English springer spaniel.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>West, E</author><author>Andreoni, V</author><author>Keeley, Bj</author><author>Self, Ia</author><author>Jones, Br</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analgesic management of an eight-year-old Springer Spaniel after amputation of a  thoracic limb.</title><secondary-title>Irish veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Irish veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>111-118</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>21851728</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/2046-0481-62-2-111</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Analgesic agents were administered perioperatively to an eight-year-old Springer  Spaniel undergoing amputation of its right thoracic limb.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Five client-owned dogs referred for SDB. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed including recheck appointments and routine preoperative and postoperative questionnaires. Whole-body barometric plethysmography was used to categorize SDB. RESULTS: All dogs presented with multiple episodes of stertorous breathing, choking, and apnea during sleep. Severe nasal septal deviation, aberrant nasal turbinates, and soft palate elongation and thickening were noted on computed tomography and rhinoscopy of each dog. Whole-body barometric plethysmography measurements during sleep (in 3 dogs) documented periods of choking, snoring, and apnea. Treatment combined laser turbinectomy, folding flap palatoplasty, tonsillectomy, laryngeal sacculectomy, and cuneiform process resection. All dogs improved in terms of incidence and severity of sleep apnea within 1 week, with 4 of 5 dogs achieving complete resolution. CONCLUSION: The objective measurements used to characterize SDB in this population of CKCS provided some evidence to support an obstructive cause for this condition, which improved with surgical treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing in the CKCS is a different clinical presentation of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome. Our finding of intranasal abnormalities in these 5 dogs with SDB provides justification for future research into its clinical significance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bexfield, N H</author><author>Andres-Abdo, C</author><author>Scase, T J</author><author>Constantino-Casas, F</author><author>Watson, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic hepatitis in the English springer spaniel: clinical presentation,  histological description and outcome.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>415</pages><volume>169</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Copper</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword><keyword>virology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21852307</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.d4665</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Medical records and liver histology of 68 English springer spaniels (ESS) with a  histological diagnosis of CH were reviewed retrospectively. PCR was performed on liver tissue for canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1), canine parvovirus, canine herpesvirus and pathogenic Leptospira species. Follow-up information was obtained to calculate survival times. Median age at presentation was three years seven months (range, seven months to eight years five months) and there were 48 female and 20 male dogs. Clinical signs were non-specific and five dogs were asymptomatic. All dogs had an increase in serum activity of one or more hepatobiliary enzymes. Histopathology demonstrated hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis with varying amounts of fibrosis. A predominantly lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate throughout the hepatic parenchyma was found in all 68 dogs, but 45 of these dogs also had a neutrophilic component to the inflammatory infiltrate. There was no significant copper accumulation and no aetiological agent was identified by PCR. The median survival time was 189 days (range, 1 to 1211 days), 38 dogs died within three months and 12 dogs survived more than a year following diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyers-Wallen, V N</author><author>Schlafer, D</author><author>Barr, I</author><author>Lovell-Badge, R</author><author>Keyzner, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sry-negative XX sex reversal in purebred dogs.</title><secondary-title>Molecular reproduction and development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular reproduction and development</full-title></periodical><pages>266-273</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Proteins</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10369387</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199907)53:3&lt;266::AID-MRD2&gt;3.0.CO;2-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The gene responsible for testis induction in normal male mammals is the Y-linked  Sry. However, there is increasing evidence that other genes may have testis-determining properties. In XX sex reversal (XXSR), testis tissue develops in the absence of the Y chromosome. Previous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays indicated that autosomal recessive XXSR in the American cocker spaniel is Sry-negative. In this study, genomic DNA from the breeding colony of American cocker spaniels and from privately owned purebred dogs were tested by PCR using canine primers for the Sry HMG box and by Southern blots probed with the complete canine Sry coding sequence. Sry was not detected by either method in genomic DNA of affected American cocker spaniels or in the majority (20/21) of affected privately owned purebred dogs. These results confirm that the autosomal recessive form of XXSR in the American cocker spaniel is Sry-negative. In combination with previous studies, this indicates that Sry-negative XXSR occurs in at least 15 dog breeds. The canine disorder may be genetically heterogeneous, potentially with a different mutation in each breed, and may provide several models for human Sry-negative XXSR. A comparative approach to sex determination should be informative in defining the genetic and cellular mechanisms that are common to all mammals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Laura A</author><author>Kubai, Melissa A</author><author>Murphy, Christopher J</author><author>Mutti, Donald O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocular components in three breeds of dogs with high prevalence of myopia.</title><secondary-title>Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of  Optometry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of  Optometry</full-title></periodical><pages>269-274</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Husbandry</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cornea</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Lens, Crystalline</keyword><keyword>Mydriatics</keyword><keyword>Myopia</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Refraction, Ocular</keyword><keyword>Retinoscopy</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21169876</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182058ff0</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: Experimental models of human myopia have been developed using animals of  various species. However, most of these are an induced rather than a spontaneous, naturally occurring myopia. This study was conducted to evaluate whether the spontaneous myopia found in three canine breeds was axial in nature and therefore similar to humans. METHODS: Refractive error was measured by cycloplegic retinoscopy and ocular components by A-scan ultrasound (ocular axial dimensions) and videophakometry (corneal and lens radii and powers) in 83 dogs of three breeds [English Springer Spaniels (n = 33), Toy Poodles (n = 36), and Collies (n = 14)]. Dogs with refractive errors equal to or more myopic than -0.5 diopters spherical equivalent were considered myopic. RESULTS: Myopia was most common in Toy Poodles (63.9%), followed by English Springer Spaniels (36.4%) and Collies (35.7%). Axial lengths and vitreous chamber depths were not different between myopic and non-myopic dogs (p = 0.84 and 0.63, respectively). The anterior crystalline lens radius was steeper and the lens power was greater in myopic compared with non-myopic dogs (p = 0.048 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous myopia was very common in all three breeds in this sample of dogs, with Toy Poodles being most affected. However, the cause of the myopia appeared to be refractive, that is from a steeper, more powerful crystalline lens, rather than from excess axial elongation. These breeds do not appear to be promising models for human axial myopia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fraga Veloso, Gemma</author><author>Fraga Manteiga, Eduardo</author><author>Trehy, Mary</author><author>Freeman, Alistair</author><author>McConnell, J Fraser</author><author>Dukes McEwan, Joanna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Septic pericarditis and myocardial abscess in an English Springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>39-44</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Abscess</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Arrhythmia Agents</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pericarditis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24444896</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2013.09.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Septic pericarditis and myocardial abscess are rare conditions in dogs.

Histological examination showed diffuse fibrosis with weak inflammatory reaction of extensive neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the myofibroblastic cells positive for anti-α-smooth muscle actin and anti-vimentin antibodies produced reticular and collagen fibers and brought about the dissection of hepatic cords and diffuse disappearance of hepatocytes. Reticular fibers invading between hepatocytes and the surrounding small group of hepatocytes were strongly positive for anti-collagen type III and anti-collagen type IV antibodies. The positivity to anti-fibronectin and anti-laminin antibodies was frequently continuous on the basement membrane of the sinusoids of the remaining hepatic cords and between the hepatocytes. Positive findings for anti-E-cadherin antibody were not observed between the hepatocytes showing positive findings for anti-collagen type III and anti-collagen type IV antibodies. These results may explain the expression of fibronectin and laminin that occurs prior to the invasion of reticular fibers between hepatocytes. The present study further suggests that expression of an extracellular matrix mainly containing fibronectin and laminin between the hepatocytes and proliferation of collagen fibers and reticular fibers have a major role in the rupture of the hepatic cords and disappearance of hepatocytes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gentilini, Fabio</author><author>Turba, Maria Elena</author><author>Giancola, Fiorella</author><author>Chiocchetti, Roberto</author><author>Bernardini, Chiara</author><author>Dajbychova, Markéta</author><author>Jagannathan, Vidhya</author><author>Drögemüller, Michaela</author><author>Drögemüller, Cord</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A large deletion in the GP9 gene in Cocker Spaniel dogs with Bernard-Soulier  syndrome.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0220625</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bernard-Soulier Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Association Studies</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex</keyword><keyword>Sequence Deletion</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31484196</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0220625</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Inherited bleeding disorders including abnormalities of platelet number and  function rarely occur in a variety of dog breeds, but are probably underdiagnosed.

However, the causative genetic variant in many dog breeds has until now remained unknown. Four cases of a mild to severe bleeding disorder in Cocker Spaniel dogs are herein presented. The affected dogs showed a platelet adhesion defect characterized by macrothrombocytopenia with variable platelet counts resembling human Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). Furthermore, the lack of functional GPIb-IX-V was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Whole genome sequencing of one affected dog and visual inspection of the candidate genes identified a deletion in the glycoprotein IX platelet (GP9) gene. The GP9 gene encodes a subunit of a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein complex; this functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor, which initiates the maintenance of hemostasis after injury. Variants in human GP9 are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, type C. The deletion spanned 2460 bp, and included a significant part of the single coding exon of the canine GP9 gene on dog chromosome 20. The variant results in a frameshift and premature stop codon which is predicted to truncate almost two-thirds of the encoded protein. PCR-based genotyping confirmed recessive inheritance. The homozygous variant genotype seen in affected dogs did not occur in 98 control Cocker Spaniels. Thus, it was concluded that the structural variant identified in the GP9 gene was most likely causative for the BSS-phenotype in the dogs examined. These findings provide the first large animal GP9 model for this group of inherited platelet disorders and greatly facilitate the diagnosis and identification of affected and/or normal carriers in Cocker Spaniels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morita, Tomoya</author><author>Nakamura, Kensuke</author><author>Osuga, Tatsuyuki</author><author>Hanazono, Kiwamu</author><author>Morishita, Keitaro</author><author>Takiguchi, Mitsuyoshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Change in right ventricular function in an American cocker spaniel with acute  pulmonary thromboembolism.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>1259-1265</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anticoagulants</keyword><keyword>Cardiomegaly</keyword><keyword>Computed Tomography Angiography</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypertension, Pulmonary</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Embolism</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Dysfunction, Right</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31292347</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1292/jvms.19-0082</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 12-year-old neutered female American cocker spaniel weighing 9.9 kg was  presented for evaluation with a 2-day history of dyspnea and anorexia.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. ANIMALS: Six client-owned dogs. METHODS: Medical records (1995 to 1999) of 6 dogs that had a discharging sinus in the midline of the nose removed surgically were reviewed for signalment, physical examination, surgical and histopathologic findings, and outcome. RESULTS: Three golden retrievers, 1 springer spaniel, 1 cocker spaniel, and 1 Brittany spaniel with a history of intermittent discharge from a small opening in the midline on the bridge of the nose at the junction between the nasal planum and the skin were identified. The condition was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, and previous surgical excision had been unsuccessful in 3 dogs. None of the dogs had any other congenital defects, and all dogs responded to complete surgical excision of the tract and cyst. On histopathologic examination of excised tissue, there were adnexal structures along a tract lined with stratified squamous epithelium, consistent with a developmental abnormality of ectodermal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The lesions were diagnosed as nasal dermoid sinus cysts, similar to the congenital condition described in humans. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts are rare developmental defects related to abnormal development of the pre-nasal space and may extend into the cranial vault causing cerebral abscesses or recurrent meningitis. Complete surgical excision has a good prognosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is a new condition that should be added to the surgical differential diagnosis for a discharging sinus over the external nares in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Woerdt, A</author><author>Nasisse, M P</author><author>Davidson, M G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lens-induced uveitis in dogs: 151 cases (1985-1990).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>921-926</pages><volume>201</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Cataract Extraction</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Uveitis</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1399807</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>During a 5-year period, phacolytic uveitis was diagnosed in 202 eyes of 151 dogs  admitted to the veterinary teaching hospital. The diagnosis of phacolytic uveitis was based on the finding of a cataractous lens and anterior uveitis, unassociated with other identifiable causes of uveal inflammation. The most commonly affected breeds were the Toy and Miniature Poodle (35%) and the American Cocker Spaniel (19%). The mean age was 7.0 years for all breeds, 5.1 years for the Cocker Spaniel, and 9.0 years for the Poodle breeds. Evidence of cataract resorption was visible in 72% of the eyes. Fifty-one dogs were affected bilaterally and 100 dogs unilaterally. The mean interval between recognition of the cataract and the onset of lens-induced uveitis (LIU) was 17 months; mean times of 25 and 11 months were seen in the Poodle breeds and American Cocker Spaniel, respectively. The mean age of dogs requiring greater than 1 revisit before the inflammation had subsided was 5.5 years. Complications, referable to the uveitis, were seen in 14% of eyes, the most important of which were glaucoma (16 eyes) and phthisis bulbi (9 eyes). Lens extraction surgery was done on 50 LIU-affected eyes, and on 35 normal eyes in LIU-affected animals. The 2- and 6-month success rates for LIU-affected eyes were 78 and 39%, respectively, and for normal eyes in LIU-affected animals were 85 and 71%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vercelli, A</author><author>Cornegliani, L</author><author>Portigliotti, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eyelid eosinophilic granuloma in a Siberian husky.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>31-33</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Administration, Oral</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eosinophilic Granuloma</keyword><keyword>Eyelid Diseases</keyword><keyword>Glucocorticoids</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15682738</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2005.tb00272.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine eosinophilic granuloma (CEG) is a rare skin disease of unknown origin.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the genetic cause of ARHN in ESS. ANIMALS: Sixty-three ESS (2 with ARHN, 2 obligate carriers, and 59 others), 2 mixed-breed dogs with X-linked HN, and 2 English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) with ARHN were included. METHODS: ARHN was diagnosed based on transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. DNA from affected dogs was screened for the mutation known to cause ARHN in ECS. Quantities of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA transcripts in renal cortex were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ARHN-affected dogs and 7 other dogs. The coding regions of COL4A3 and COL4A4 were sequenced for the 2 ARHN-affected ESS and an unaffected dog. Exon 30 of COL4A4 was sequenced for all 63 ESS. RESULTS: qRT-PCR indicated a significant reduction in transcript levels of both COL4A3 and COL4A4 mRNA in the kidney of ARHN-affected ESS. Sequencing identified a single nucleotide substitution in COL4A4 at base 2806 resulting in a premature stop codon. Thirteen of 25 related dogs were identified as carriers. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A mutation highly likely to cause ARHN in ESS has been identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lord, P</author><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Häggström, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rate of change of heart size before congestive heart failure in dogs with mitral  regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>210-218</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20406369</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2010.00910.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to examine the changes in vertebral  heart scale, and left atrial and ventricular dimensions before and at onset of congestive heart failure in cavalier King Charles spaniels with mitral regurgitation. METHODS: Records and radiographs from 24 cavalier King Charles spaniels with mitral regurgitation were used. Vertebral heart scale (24 dogs), and left atrial dimension and left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic diameters (18 dogs) and their rate of increase were measured at intervals over years to the onset of congestive heart failure. They were plotted against time to onset of congestive heart failure. RESULTS: Dimensions and rates of change of all parameters were highest at onset of congestive heart failure, the difference between observed and chance outcome being highly significant using a two-tailed chi-square test (P&lt;0.001). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The left heart chambers increase in size rapidly only in the last year before the onset of congestive heart failure. Increasing left ventricular end systolic dimension is suggestive of myocardial failure before the onset of congestive heart failure. Rate of increase of heart dimensions may be a useful indicator of impending congestive heart failure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Estey, Chelsie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A case of valvular pulmonic stenosis and an aberrant coronary artery in a  Brittany spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>541-543</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessel Anomalies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Valve Stenosis</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22043079</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Valvular pulmonic stenosis and aberrancy of the right coronary artery with  subsequent subvalvular stenosis was found on echocardiographic evaluation of a 9-month-old Brittany spaniel.

Identified risk factors include advancing age, specific breeds, small body size, and periodontal disease. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and identify risk factors associated with CKD diagnosis and survival in dogs. Purebred dogs were hypothesized to have higher CKD risk and poorer survival characteristics than crossbred dogs. ANIMALS: A merged clinical database of 107,214 dogs attending 89 UK veterinary practices over a 2-year period (January 2010-December 2011). METHODS: A longitudinal study design estimated the apparent prevalence (AP) whereas the true prevalence (TP) was estimated using Bayesian analysis. A nested case-control study design evaluated risk factors. Survival analysis used the Kaplan-Meier survival curve method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: The CKD AP was 0.21% (95% CI: 0.19-0.24%) and TP was 0.37% (95% posterior credibility interval 0.02-1.44%). Significant risk factors included increasing age, being insured, and certain breeds (Cocker Spaniel, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel). Cardiac disease was a significant comorbid disorder. Significant clinical signs included halitosis, weight loss, polyuria/polydipsia, urinary incontinence, vomiting, decreased appetite, lethargy, and diarrhea. The median survival time from diagnosis was 226 days (95% CI 112-326 days). International Renal Interest Society stage and blood urea nitrogen concentration at diagnosis were significantly associated with hazard of death due to CKD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Chronic kidney disease compromises dog welfare. Increased awareness of CKD risk factors and association of blood biochemistry results with survival time should facilitate diagnosis and optimize case management to improve animal survival and welfare.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stafford Johnson, J M</author><author>Martin, M W S</author><author>Stidworthy, M F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Septic fibrinous pericarditis in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>117-120</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiac Tamponade</keyword><keyword>Citrobacter</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pericardial Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pericarditis</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12653326</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00131.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A four-year-old cocker spaniel presented with cardiac tamponade due to a  pericardial effusion, in addition to pyrexia and peripheral neutrophilia and a recent history of chest trauma.

Canine diabetes is likely to have a complex pathogenesis with multiple genes contributing to overall susceptibility and/or disease progression. An association has previously been shown between canine diabetes and MHC class II genes, although other genes are also likely to contribute to the genetic risk. Potential diabetes susceptibility genes include immuno-regulatory TH1/TH2 cytokines such as IFNgamma, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-10. We screened these candidate genes for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a range of different dog breeds using dHPLC analysis and DNA sequencing. Thirty-eight of the SNPs were genotyped in crossbreed dogs and seven other breed groups (Labrador Retriever, West Highland White Terrier, Collie, Schnauzer, Cairn Terrier, Samoyed and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), which demonstrated substantial intra-breed differences in allele frequencies. When SNPs were examined for an association with diabetes by case:control analysis significant associations were observed for IL-4 in three breeds, the Collie, Cairn Terrier and Schnauzer and for IL-10 in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. These results suggest that canine cytokine genes regulating the TH1/TH2 immune balance might play a contributory role in determining susceptibility to diabetes in some breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meurs, K M</author><author>Friedenberg, S G</author><author>Williams, B</author><author>Keene, B W</author><author>Atkins, C E</author><author>Adin, D</author><author>Aona, B</author><author>DeFrancesco, T</author><author>Tou, S</author><author>Mackay, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of genes associated with human myxomatous mitral valve disease in dogs  with familial myxomatous mitral valve degeneration.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>16-19</pages><volume>232</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Whole Genome Sequencing</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29428085</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2017.12.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease in the  dog. It is believed to be heritable in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) and Dachshunds. Myxomatous mitral valve disease is a familial disease in human beings as well and genetic mutations have been associated with its development. We hypothesized that a genetic mutation associated with the development of the human form of MMVD was associated with the development of canine MMVD. DNA was isolated from blood samples from 10 CKCS and 10 Dachshunds diagnosed with MMVD, and whole genome sequences from each animal were obtained. Variant calling from whole genome sequencing data was performed using a standardized bioinformatics pipeline for all samples. After filtering, the canine genes orthologous to the human genes known to be associated with MMVD were identified and variants were assessed for likely pathogenic implications. No variant was found in any of the genes evaluated that was present in least eight of 10 affected CKCS or Dachshunds. Although mitral valve disease in the CKCS and Dachshund is a familial disease, we did not identify genetic cause in the genes responsible for the human disease in the dogs studied here.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bayley, Kellam D</author><author>Read, R A</author><author>Gates, M Carolyn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Superficial keratectomy as a treatment for non-healing corneal ulceration  associated with primary corneal endothelial degeneration.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>485-492</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Corneal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Corneal Ulcer</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Keratectomy</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30365226</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12617</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To analyze a study population of dogs with primary corneal endothelial  degeneration (PCED) for information on the patterns of disease and to report the efficacy of superficial keratectomy (SK) for resolution of non-healing corneal ulcers associated with PCED.

PROCEDURES: A retrospective assessment of medical records was performed to determine the signalment patterns of PCED, and the success rate of the SK procedure for resolving PCED-associated corneal ulceration. Descriptive statistics were reported on the signalment of PCED cases, with odd ratios and confidence intervals calculated to detect breed predispositions. RESULTS: Primary corneal endothelial degeneration was diagnosed in 238 dogs, 40.8% were female and 59.2% were male, with a mean age at diagnosis of 11.4 years. Dachshunds, Dalmatians, English Springer Spaniels, Welsh Springer Spaniels, Chihuahuas, Cocker Spaniels, and Golden Retrievers were significantly over-represented. All PCED-affected Dalmatians developed associated corneal ulceration. Follow-up information was available for 41/47 eyes treated with SK. At the first reassessment, 87.8% were healed which increased to 97.6% with subsequent monitoring. Four eyes (9.8%) had late corneal ulcer occurrence following SK, at a median time following SK of 182 weeks post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Superficial keratectomy was an effective option for resolving painful non-healing corneal ulcers associated with PCED. Dalmatians may be at increased risk of developing PCED-associated corneal ulceration.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Louly, Carla Cristina Braz</author><author>Soares, Sara Fernandes</author><author>da Nóbrega Silveira, Diana</author><author>Guimarães, Marcelo Sales</author><author>Borges, Lígia Miranda Ferreira</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences in the behavior of Rhipicephalus sanguineus tested against resistant  and susceptible dogs.</title><secondary-title>Experimental &amp; applied acarology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental &amp; applied acarology</full-title></periodical><pages>353-362</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Disease Susceptibility</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Host-Parasite Interactions</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tick Infestations</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20091335</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10493-009-9334-3</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>To ascertain whether brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sp. infests resistant (beagle)  and susceptible (English cocker spaniel) dogs differently, five animals of each breed were maintained in a kennel whose walls were infested with 7,000 larvae, 320 nymphs, 80 males and 80 females, in 3 infestations, at 10-day intervals. Five times more ticks were found on cocker spaniels (498) than on beagles (96). Substances were collected by rubbing pieces of clean flannel on the dogs for 15 min and these were tested for arrestment and attractiveness of ticks. Three choices were offered: cocker extract vs. control; beagle extract vs. control, and cocker extract vs. beagle extract. When allowed to choose between substances rubbed from dogs and a control, more ticks were arrested by extracts from the cockers than from beagles. In the arrestment tests with only a choice between substances from dogs of each breed, more ticks were arrested by cocker substances. To test for attraction, capsules containing adsorbent were used and the tests were carried out in a Y-olfactometer. Fifteen males and 15 females were tested, for each treatment. In the olfactometer, the ticks were not attracted to the odor of either breed, however the odor of the Beagle was apparently repellent. These results indicate that R. sanguineus can use substances from the dogs to differentiate susceptible English Cocker Spaniels from resistant Beagles.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aguirre-Hernández, J</author><author>Polton, G</author><author>Kennedy, L J</author><author>Sargan, D R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association between anal sac gland carcinoma and dog leukocyte antigen-DQB1 in  the English Cocker Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Tissue antigens</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tissue antigens</full-title></periodical><pages>476-481</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class I</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class II</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20727114</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1399-0039.2010.01554.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Anal sac gland carcinomas occur frequently in English Cocker Spaniels and, to a  lesser extent, in other spaniel breeds. The disease typically presents in dogs aged 8 years or older and frequently metastasises to the local lymph nodes. The association between anal sac gland carcinoma in English Cocker Spaniels and the major histocompatibility complex class II loci (the dog leukocyte antigen loci DLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1) was investigated in 42 cases and 75 controls. Based on a corrected error rate of 0.017 for each test, the allele distribution in DLA-DRB1 showed no significant difference between cases and controls (P value = 0.019), while a significant difference was obtained for DLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles (P values are 0.010 and 3.3 × 10⁻⁵). The DLA-DQB1*00701 allele was the most common in both cases and controls, but it had a higher frequency among the former (0.89) than in the latter (0.61), while the second most common allele had a higher frequency in the controls (0.23) than in the cases (0.07). Haplotype distributions were also significantly different between the two groups (P value = 1.61 × 10⁻⁴). This is the second disease in English Cocker Spaniels for which the most common DLA-DQB1 allele in the breed has been shown to have a higher frequency in cases than controls, while the second most common allele in the breed (*02001) has a significantly higher frequency in the controls, compared with the cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bexfield, N H</author><author>Buxton, R J</author><author>Vicek, T J</author><author>Day, M J</author><author>Bailey, S M</author><author>Haugland, S P</author><author>Morrison, L R</author><author>Else, R W</author><author>Constantino-Casas, F</author><author>Watson, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed, age and gender distribution of dogs with chronic hepatitis in the United  Kingdom.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>124-128</pages><volume>193</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22225827</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.11.024</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Standardised histological criteria are now available for the diagnosis of canine  chronic hepatitis (CH). CH is common in dogs, but no studies have reported breed, age and gender distributions in the United Kingdom (UK). The objective of this study was to determine which breeds had an increased risk for developing CH in the UK and to report the age and gender distribution for those breeds. The databases of six veterinary histopathology laboratories were searched for cases with a histological diagnosis of CH according to standardised criteria. The breed, age and gender of dogs was recorded and compared to a control population to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals for developing CH. A total of 551 cases of CH were identified, consisting of 61 breeds. Nineteen breeds were represented by five or more cases. Breeds with an increased risk for developing CH included the American cocker spaniel, Cairn terrier, Dalmatian, Dobermann pinscher, English cocker spaniel, English springer spaniel, Great Dane, Labrador retriever and Samoyed. The median age at diagnosis for all breeds with CH was 8 years (range 7 months to 16 years). Dalmatians, Dobermann pinschers and English springer spaniels with CH were significantly younger than Cairn terriers, English cocker spaniels and Labrador retrievers with CH. Females were over-represented when all cases were examined together. In conclusion, several breeds in the UK have an increased risk of CH, some of which have not been previously reported.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwochka, K W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell proliferation kinetics in the hair root matrix of dogs with healthy skin and  dogs with idiopathic seborrhea.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1570-1573</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoradiography</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Seborrheic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hair</keyword><keyword>Hair Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year></dates><accession-num>2146909</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cell proliferation kinetic values were established for the hair root matrix of  primary anagen follicles of 14 Beagles and 4 Cocker Spaniels with healthy skin and 9 Cocker Spaniels with primary idiopathic seborrhea.

The dog was surgically treated with resection of the metacarpal pad and transposition of the second digital pad. A severe infection developed 11 days postoperatively but was managed with antibiotics and intensive wound therapy. The surgical technique was successful, considerable adaptation of the transposed pad occurred and the dog returned to full weightbearing on the leg. However, one year later another area of new ulceration developed on the dorsomedial aspect of the paw.

ANIMALS STUDIED: 10 normal beagles, 10 beagles with inherited primary open-angle glaucoma, 4 cocker spaniels with spontaneous glaucoma. PROCEDURES: Formalin-preserved globes were sectioned tangentially and sagittally and treated with H&amp;E, Masson's trichrome, or elastin stains or analyzed by immunohistochemistry to visualize smooth muscle actin. Tissues associated with the US pathway were observed and compared using light microscopy. RESULTS: Tangentially oriented sections clearly revealed spaces for the transport of aqueous humor at the junction of the posterior iridocorneal angle (ICA) and anterior ciliary body musculature (CBM). Within the external anterior-most of the US pathway, the supraciliary space, distinct connective tissue cords and smooth muscle pegs fastened the ciliary body to the adjacent sclera. Compared to normal controls, glaucomatous eyes developed a robust scleral elastic sheath at the junction between the posterior ICA and the anterior CBM. In advanced glaucomatous beagles and cocker spaniels, a large amount of melanophores were seen in the US pathway and surrounding vasculature. Within the C8M of glaucomatous specimens, the smooth muscle bundles appeared fewer and separated by elastic-rich ECM. Structures of the US pathway changed little with age. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior portion of the canine US pathway is well defined and appears to be altered little with age. However with glaucoma, changes of the US pathway were associated with its the elastic components, as well as the accumulation of melanophores. Collectively, these changes may have an effect on US outflow and, subsequently, aqueous humor dynamics.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thoefner, Maria S</author><author>Skovgaard, Lene T</author><author>McEvoy, Fintan J</author><author>Berendt, Mette</author><author>Bjerrum, Ole J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pregabalin alleviates clinical signs of syringomyelia-related central neuropathic  pain in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs: a randomized controlled trial.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</full-title></periodical><pages>238-248</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Analgesics</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Double-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Pregabalin</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32005620</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vaa.2019.09.007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy and benefit-risk profile of pregabalin  (PGN) to reduce the clinical signs of central neuropathic pain (CNeP) as reflected by scratching episodes in dogs with symptomatic syringomyelia (SM). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. ANIMALS: A total of 12 client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (age, 1.1-7.4 years, bodyweight, 8.2-10.8 kg) with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed SM and clinical signs of CNeP. METHODS: Dogs were randomized to either PGN 150 mg or placebo for 25 days, followed by 48 hour washout period before crossover to the alternate phase of 25 days. The primary outcome was defined as number of scratching events during 10 minutes of video-recorded physical activity. Treatment effect was estimated using a generalized estimation equation model. Benefit-risk and quality of life assessments were obtained through owner interviews focusing on potential adverse events. RESULTS: The treatment effect estimate was an 84% (95% confidence interval = 75-89%) reduction in mean number of scratching events relative to baseline compared with placebo (p &lt; 0.0001). Owner-assessed satisfactory quality of life was status quo and rated as 'good' or 'could not be better' in six/11 dogs and improved in four/11 dogs. The most prevalent adverse events were increased appetite in nine/12 dogs and transient ataxia in nine/12 dogs. There was one dog withdrawn by the owner 7 days after crossover to PGN owing to persistent ataxia. No dogs needed rescue analgesia during the trial. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PGN is superior to placebo in the reduction of clinical signs of SM-related CNeP in dogs. At a dose range of 13-19 mg kg(-1) orally twice daily, the encountered adverse events were acceptable to all but one owner.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clarke, Lorelei L</author><author>Kelly, Lisa S</author><author>Garner, Bridget</author><author>Brown, Cathy A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atypical cytologic presentation of a histiocytic sarcoma in a Cavalier King  Charles Spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</full-title></periodical><pages>541-543</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Histiocytic Sarcoma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28381106</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1040638717701521</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dog was presented because of a 10-d history of  progressive vomiting, inappetence, and lethargy, with mild neurologic signs.

Additionally, there was a Chiari-like malformation of the skull with corresponding syringomyelia of the cranial spinal cord. Histologically, the neoplasm was comprised of a pleomorphic population of round cells with a high mitotic rate. Cells stained positive for vimentin and CD18 and negative for cytokeratin, chromogranin A, CD3, CD20, MHC II, and CD11d, and hence the tumor was diagnosed as a histiocytic sarcoma.

METHODS: Electronic patient records of dogs (n=134,329) attending 152 veterinary clinics during 2017 were sourced through VetCompass Australia. They included 418 dogs with DM; a prevalence of 0.36 per cent (95 per cent CI 0.33 per cent to 0.39 per cent) in Australian dogs attending these veterinary clinics. By comparing with the reference group of rarer breeds and unidentified crossbreeds, multivariable modelling was used to reveal breeds (and their crosses) with significantly higher odds of having DM. RESULTS: The results revealed that breeds (and their crosses) with significantly higher odds of having DM were Australian terriers (ORs=7.93 (95 per cent CI 2.83 to 22.27)), Siberian huskies (OR=6.24 (95 per cent CI 2.51 to 15.54)), English springer spaniels (OR=5.37 (95 per cent CI 1.48 to 19.53)), West Highland white terriers (OR=4.85 (95 per cent CI 2.55 to 9.25)), miniature schnauzers (OR=3.47 (95 per cent CI 1.16 to 10.35)), all types of poodles (OR=3.41 (95 per cent CI 2.07 to 5.61)), bichon frises (OR=3.41 (95 per cent CI 1.65 to 7.01)), schnauzers (OR=3.18 (95 per cent CI 1.42 to 7.11)) and cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS; OR=1.84 (95 per cent CI 1.08 to 3.13)). Breeds with lower risk were German shepherd dogs (OR=0.11 (95 per cent CI 0.01 to 0.84)), golden retrievers (OR=0.09 (95 per cent CI 0.01 to 0.68)) and boxers (no cases identified). Fisher's exact tests showed that labradoodles were diagnosed significantly more often than purebred Labradors (P=0.04) and did not differ significantly from poodles (P=0.81). Cavoodles did not differ significantly from either CKCS (p~1.00) or poodles (P=0.12). Spoodles were significantly less diagnosed than poodles (P=0.003) but did not differ from cocker spaniels (P=0.66). Desexed male dogs had a higher odds of DM than entire male (OR=0.62 (95 per cent CI 0.39 to 0.98)) and desexed female dogs (OR=0.76 (95 per cent CI 0.61 to 0.96)). Comorbidities/sequelae associated with canine DM included suspected pancreatitis (OR 10.58 (95 per cent CI 5.17 to 22.78)), cataracts (OR 9.80 (95 per cent CI 5.65 to 17.35)), hyperadrenocorticism (OR 6.21 (95 per cent CI 3.29 to 11.88)), urinary tract infection (OR 5.09 (95 per cent CI 1.97 to 13.41)) and hypothyroidism (OR 4.10 (95 per cent CI 1.08 to 15.58)). CONCLUSIONS: Breeds at most risk included Australian terriers and Siberian huskies as previously reported, as well as, for the first time, English springer spaniels. In contrast to other populations where there is female predisposition for DM, desexed male dogs in Australia were at increased risk for DM compared with both entire males and desexed females. This predisposition for desexed males to develop DM warrants further investigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swift, S</author><author>Baldin, A</author><author>Cripps, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Degenerative Valvular Disease in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel: Results of  the UK Breed Scheme 1991-2010.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>9-14</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28054393</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14619</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) are predisposed to  degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) and studies have indicated a genetic cause. ANIMALS: A total of 8,860 CKCSs were examined at shows or private clinics from 1991 to 2010. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effects of a breed scheme for CKCS on the age at which a murmur consistent with DMVD was first detected. METHODS: The presence or absence of a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation was noted and age a murmur was first detected recorded. RESULTS: A total of 16,887 examinations were performed on 8,860 dogs. The median age dogs developed a murmur were slightly younger in male than female dogs (7.8 versus 8.3 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.4-8.1 versus 8.0-8.4, P &lt; .001) and cardiologists detected murmurs in younger dogs than did general practitioner (GP) veterinary surgeons (7.2 versus 8.6 years, 95% CI 7.0-7.4 versus 8.3-8.7 P &lt; .001). In bitches examined by GP vets during the study, there was a significantly increased age of detection of murmurs over time (8.6-9.2 years, 95% CI 8.3-9.1 and 8.5-10.9, P = .001) but not for male dogs examined by GP vets or dogs of either sex examined by cardiologists. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study suggests that the age incidence of murmurs associated with DMVD might be increased by application of breeding guidelines based on auscultation alone. This benefit was only seen in a subgroup and compliance of breeders with this voluntary scheme was poor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blehaut, T R W</author><author>Hardstaff, J L</author><author>Chapman, P S</author><author>Pfeiffer, D U</author><author>Boag, A K</author><author>Guitian, F J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial, demographic and clinical patterns of Angiostrongylus vasorum infection  in the dog population of Southern England.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>148</pages><volume>175</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Distribution</keyword><keyword>Angiostrongylus</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Distribution</keyword><keyword>Spatial Analysis</keyword><keyword>Strongylida Infections</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24878572</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.102186</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A retrospective study was carried out to provide updated knowledge of the spatial  pattern of Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in Southern England and to investigate associations between selected host characteristics (age, breed, sex), risk of infection and clinical presentation (cardiorespiratory signs v haemorrhagic diathesis). One hundred and forty-one cases diagnosed between April 1999 and July 2012 were compared with a control population of dogs referred to the same hospital. A significant association was found between haemorrhagic diathesis and breed but not for other host characteristics and clinical presentations. Younger dogs and certain breeds of dog (Jack Russell terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Springer Spaniels, Cavalier King Charles spaniels and Staffordshire Bull Terriers) had significantly higher odds of angiostrongylosis than other breeds in the study. A significant cluster of cases was found in Southern England. Animals presenting with cardiorespiratory signs or haemorrhagic diathesis in Southern England, especially if they are young or of a breed associated with angiostrongylosis, should be given special consideration with regards to possible A. vasorum infestation. Our results should be interpreted bearing in mind that they are based on the retrospective exploration of dogs seen at a referral centre.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mielke, Ben</author><author>Lam, Richard</author><author>Ter Haar, Gert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomographic morphometry of tympanic bulla shape and position in  brachycephalic and mesaticephalic dog breeds.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>552-558</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Temporal Bone</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28726244</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.12529</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Anatomic variations in skull morphology have been previously described for  brachycephalic dogs; however there is little published information on interbreed variations in tympanic bulla morphology. This retrospective observational study aimed to (1) provide detailed descriptions of the computed tomographic (CT) morphology of tympanic bullae in a sample of dogs representing four brachycephalic breeds (Pugs, French Bulldogs, English Bulldog, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels) versus two mesaticephalic breeds (Labrador retrievers and Jack Russell Terriers); and (2) test associations between tympanic bulla morphology and presence of middle ear effusion. Archived head CT scans for the above dog breeds were retrieved and a single observer measured tympanic bulla shape (width:height ratio), wall thickness, position relative to the temporomandibular joint, and relative volume (volume:body weight ratio). A total of 127 dogs were sampled. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels had significantly flatter tympanic bullae (greater width:height ratios) versus Pugs, English Bulldogs, Labrador retrievers, and Jack Russell terriers. French Bulldogs and Pugs had significantly more overlap between tympanic bullae and temporomandibular joints versus other breeds. All brachycephalic breeds had significantly lower tympanic bulla volume:weight ratios versus Labrador retrievers. Soft tissue attenuating material (middle ear effusion) was present in the middle ear of 48/100 (48%) of brachycephalic breeds, but no significant association was found between tympanic bulla CT measurements and presence of this material. Findings indicated that there are significant interbreed variations in tympanic bulla morphology, however no significant relationship between tympanic bulla morphology and presence of middle ear effusion could be identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl"

is the most common hematological malignancy in developed countries.  Outcome is strongly determined by molecular subtype, reflecting a need for new and improved treatment options. Dogs spontaneously develop lymphoma, and the predisposition of certain breeds indicates genetic risk factors. Using the dog breed structure, we selected three lymphoma predisposed breeds developing primarily T-cell (boxer), primarily B-cell (cocker spaniel), and with equal distribution of B- and T-cell lymphoma (golden retriever), respectively. We investigated the somatic mutations in B- and T-cell lymphomas from these breeds by exome sequencing of tumor and normal pairs. Strong similarities were evident between B-cell lymphomas from golden retrievers and cocker spaniels, with recurrent mutations in TRAF3-MAP3K14 (28% of all cases), FBXW7 (25%), and POT1 (17%). The FBXW7 mutations recurrently occur in a specific codon; the corresponding codon is recurrently mutated in human cancer. In contrast, T-cell lymphomas from the predisposed breeds, boxers and golden retrievers, show little overlap in their mutation pattern, sharing only one of their 15 most recurrently mutated genes. Boxers, which develop aggressive T-cell lymphomas, are typically mutated in the PTEN-mTOR pathway. T-cell lymphomas in golden retrievers are often less aggressive, and their tumors typically showed mutations in genes involved in cellular metabolism. We identify genes with known involvement in human lymphoma and leukemia, genes implicated in other human cancers, as well as novel genes that could allow new therapeutic options.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Osinchuk, Stephanie C</author><author>Sandmeyer, Lynne S</author><author>Grahn, Bruce H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vivo imaging comparison of unilateral circular retinal plaques in retriever  dogs to dysplasia and detachment in the English Springer Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>957-963</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein Angiography</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ophthalmoscopy</keyword><keyword>Retinal Detachment</keyword><keyword>Retinal Dysplasia</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tomography, Optical Coherence</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32990375</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12828</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: To compare the scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), optical coherence  tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography (FA) findings in retrievers with a single unilateral circular retinal plaque to those of an English springer spaniel with bilateral retinal dysplasia. PROCEDURES: A retrospective record review identified three dogs with circular retinal plaques that underwent SLO and OCT; in two of the three dogs, FA was also completed. Morphologic changes, lesion measurements, and angiogram characteristics were documented. An English springer spaniel with bilateral retinal dysplasia that had undergone SLO, OCT, and FA was used for comparison. RESULTS: Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of the retriever dogs revealed circular retinal plaques with a dark periphery located in the tapetal retina. OCT revealed a thickening of the nerve fiber layer corresponding to the circular pattern observed on SLO. Within the circular plaque, the retina was predominantly of normal architecture. FA revealed variable hypofluorescence of both the rim and the center of the circular lesion throughout the early angiogram phases. In the late recirculation phase, small multifocal areas of hyperfluorescence were observed. OCT of geographic retinal dysplasia in the English springer spaniel revealed disorganization of both inner and outer retinal layers, and retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS: Circular plaques observed in the tapetal retina are predominantly formed by a thickening of inner retina, while retinal dysplasia has disorganization of both inner and outer retinal layers. Further etiologic research is needed, including pedigree mapping to determine whether retinal plaques are an acquired or inherited condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Witte, P G</author><author>Bush, M A</author><author>Scott, H W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Propagation of a partial incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in an  American cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>591-593</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20973787</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2010.00988.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A hypoattenuating lesion in the left humeral condyle of an American cocker  spaniel consistent with partial incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle was observed on computed tomography.

Sinus arrhythmia and atrial premature complexes leading to R-R interval variations occur in dogs. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the duration of the R-R interval immediately influences the degree of MR assessed by echocardiography in dogs. Clinical examination including echocardiography was performed in 103 privately-owned dogs: 16 control Beagles, 70 CKCSs with different degree of MR and 17 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of congestive heart failure due to MMVD. The severity of MR was evaluated in apical four-chamber view using colour Doppler flow mapping (maximum % of the left atrium area) and colour Doppler M-mode (duration in ms). The influence of the ratio between present and preceding R-R interval on MR severity was evaluated in 10 consecutive R-R intervals using a linear mixed model for repeated measurements. MR severity was increased when a short R-R interval was followed by a long R-R interval in CKCSs with different degrees of MR (P&lt;0.005 when adjusted for multiple testing). The relationship was not significant in control dogs with minimal MR and in dogs with severe MR and clinical signs of heart failure. In conclusion, MR severity increases in long R-R intervals when these follow a short R-R interval in CKCSs with different degrees of MR due to asymptomatic MMVD. Thus, R-R interval variations may affect the echocardiographic grading of MR in CKCSs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeringóta, Viviane</author><author>Pereira-Junior, Ronaldo A</author><author>Sarria, André L F</author><author>Henrique, Ariele C C</author><author>Birkett, Michael A</author><author>Borges, Lígia M F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a non-host semiochemical from miniature pinscher, Canis lupus  familiaris, that repels Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Acari: Ixodidae).</title><secondary-title>Ticks and tick-borne diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ticks and tick-borne diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>101582</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Acaricides</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzaldehydes</keyword><keyword>Benzene Derivatives</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Methyl n-Butyl Ketone</keyword><keyword>Pheromones</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</keyword><keyword>Tick Control</keyword><keyword>Tick Infestations</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>instrumentation</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33038704</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ttbdis.2020.101582</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>It is already known that the beagle breed of domestic dogs produces  semiochemicals capable of repelling the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.). With a view to discovering new non-host semiochemicals as tick repellents, we compared the semiochemicals produced by a putative tick-resistant breed of dog, miniature pinscher, with known tick-resistant (beagle) and tick-susceptible (English cocker spaniel) breeds. Two non-host compounds produced by beagles, i.e. 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde, were shown to be present in samples collected from all three breeds. Furthermore, two compounds, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, were found in higher amounts in samples collected from miniature pinscher dogs. The mean amounts of benzaldehyde, 2-hexanone and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were similar for beagles and miniature pinschers (P &gt; 0.05) and higher than the means observed for cocker spaniels (P &lt; 0.05), whereas the mean amount of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one produced by miniature pinschers was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than for the other breeds of dogs. In Petri-dish assays with adult R. sanguineus s.l., 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was repellent for all observation periods evaluated for the two highest concentrations (0.100 and 0.200 mg.cm(-2), P &lt; 0.01). The obtained results support our hypothesis that miniature pinschers are a tick-resistant dog breed and agree with previous observations of miniature pinschers being the breed least parasitized by ticks. Furthermore, the non-host semiochemical 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one has potential to be developed for use as a repellent for the protection of susceptible dogs from R. sanguineus s.l. ticks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Delling, Cora</author><author>Böttcher, Denny</author><author>Cabrera-García, Isabel A</author><author>Kiefer, Ingmar</author><author>Helm, Christiane</author><author>Daugschies, Arwid</author><author>Heilmann, Romy M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical, pathological and parasitological examinations of a German spaniel with  alveolar echinococcosis, Germany, 2018.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports</full-title></periodical><pages>100403</pages><volume>20</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echinococcosis</keyword><keyword>Echinococcus multilocularis</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Germany</keyword><keyword>Helminth Proteins</keyword><keyword>Larva</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32448547</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vprsr.2020.100403</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a parasitic zoonosis occurring in most European  countries and also emerging in parts of Asia and North America. AE is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis in intermediate and also in accidental hosts. The principal definitive host is the red fox, but domestic dogs and cats are also potential definitive hosts. Several species of rodents serve as intermediate hosts of this parasite. However, there are also some species acting as accidental intermediate hosts, among them dogs. Since the late 1980s cases of canine AE have been diagnosed. Here, we present a case of canine AE in a two-year old female intact German spaniel from Thuringia, Central Germany. The dog was used as a hunting dog and presented to a small animal clinic for subacute lethargy and inappetence. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast computed tomography (CT) scan were performed and revealed intrahepatic lesions. Multinodular changes of the liver and the greater omentum were demonstrated by exploratory laparotomy. After euthanasia, a necropsy was performed and histological sections of representative tissue samples were prepared. PCR followed by sequencing was conducted with DNA extracted from tissue samples of the liver, hepatic lymph nodes and greater omentum. The sequence herein obtained showed very high similarity with other partial nad2 sequences of E. multilocularis from the GenBank database by BLASTn analysis and was analysed using the maximum likelihood method. The presented case combines the clinical presentation and pathological, parasitological and phylogenetic analyses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herrtage, M E</author><author>Palmer, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Episodic falling in the cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>458-459</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Movement Disorders</keyword><keyword>Muscle Cramp</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year></dates><accession-num>6868317</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.112.19.458</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ortloff, A</author><author>Morán, G</author><author>Olavarría, A</author><author>Folch, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis possibly associated with  over-vaccination in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>499-502</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative</keyword><keyword>Kidney Glomerulus</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Vaccination</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>chemically  induced</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>21050219</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2010.00978.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis was observed in a seven-month-old male  cocker spaniel dog.

In both kidneys, severe thickening of the glomerular capillary walls was observed. Electron microscope examination revealed a large number of electron-dense deposits that were primarily in the glomerular subendothelial spaces and the basal membrane, which is compatible with antigen-antibody complexes. The immunohistochemical examination revealed that the antigen present in the glomeruli corresponded with the antigen present in the vaccine.

Sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images have been described as the preferred technique for visualizing SM in dogs and humans. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether computed tomography (CT) can be used to diagnose SM. ANIMALS: Thirty-two client-owned dogs referred for investigation of the cervical spine on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT. METHODS: Two reviewers retrospectively analyzed sagittal and transverse T1-weighted spin echo (T1WSE) MR images and CT images from each dog for the presence of SM and, if SM was present, the width (mm, syrinx width [SW]) was measured. The results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: For the presence of SM there was a moderate interobserver agreement for MR (81%, κ = 0.54) and almost perfect agreement for CT (94%, κ = 0.87). There was a moderate intramodality agreement for both observers (observer 1 81%, κ = 0.59; observer 2 81%, κ = 0.57). For measurement of SW the repeatability was the best on the midsagittal T1WSE images (95% repeatability coefficient &lt;0.52 mm) and the reproducibility was the best on midsagittal images in both modalities (95% limits of agreement -0.55-0.45; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Both techniques can be used to detect SM. Midsagittal MR and CT images are best used for measuring SW. Computed tomography can be used as a diagnostic tool for SM when MRI is not available, but CT cannot replace MRI as the standard screening technique for the detection of SM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel for breeding purposes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doxey, S</author><author>Boswood, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences between breeds of dog in a measure of heart rate variability.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>713-717</pages><volume>154</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15214514</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.154.23.713</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The vasovagal tonus index (VVTI), a time-domain indicator of heart rate  variability, was measured in 92 dogs of six breeds (German shepherd dogs, labrador retrievers, cocker spaniels, boxers, bulldogs and cavalier King Charles spaniels).

These closed genetic populations have metabolic and physiological characteristics that may be revealed by metabolomic analysis. OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterise the drivers of metabolic differences in the fasted plasma metabolome and then determine metabolites differentiating breeds. METHODS: Fasted plasma samples were collected from dogs maintained under two environmental conditions (controlled and client-owned at home). The former (n = 33) consisted of three breeds (Labrador Retriever, Cocker Spaniel and Miniature Schnauzer) fed a single diet batch, the latter (n = 96), client-owned dogs consisted of 9 breeds (Beagle, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, Dachshund, Golden Retriever, Greyhound, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Maltese) consuming various diets under differing feeding regimens. Triplicate samples were taken from Beagle (n = 10) and Labrador Retriever (n = 9) over 3 months. Non-targeted metabolite fingerprinting was performed using flow infusion electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry which was coupled with multivariate data analysis. Metadata factors including age, gender, sexual status, weight, diet and breed were investigated. RESULTS: Breed differences were identified in the plasma metabolome of dogs housed in a controlled environment. Triplicate samples from two breeds identified intra-individual variability, yet breed separation was still observed. The main drivers of variance in dogs maintained in the home environment were associated with breed and gender. Furthermore, metabolite signals were identified that discriminated between Labrador Retriever and Cocker Spaniels in both environments. CONCLUSION: Metabolite fingerprinting of plasma samples can be used to investigate breed differences in client-owned dogs, despite added variance of diet, sexual status and environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carruthers, H</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Dubé, M-P</author><author>Holmes, M</author><author>Jeffery, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association between cervical and intracranial dimensions and syringomyelia in the  cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>394-398</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cervical Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Spinal Canal</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19689666</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00768.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possible association between caudal fossa area and  cervical vertebral dimensions and the presence of syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels. METHODS: From magnetic resonance imaging scans of 78 cavalier King Charles spaniels, measurements were made of the widest vertical spinal width at C1/C2, C2, C2/C3 and C3; angulation of the C2/C3 spine; and estimated caudal fossa area. A correlation between these measurements and syringomyelia was sought. RESULTS: A total of 59 dogs with and 19 without syringomyelia were compared. Older dogs had a significantly higher incidence of syringomyelia. No difference in incidence was noted between genders. There was no significant difference in vertebral canal width at C1/C2 and C2, or angulation of C2/C3 between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups. The width of the canal at C2/C3 and C3 was significantly increased in syringomyelia dogs. There was no significant difference in the caudal fossa area between groups. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although syringomyelia was shown to be more prevalent in older dogs, the age beyond which dogs were considered at greater risk was not deducible from the dataset. The association identified between wider spinal canal at C3, and C2/C3 and syringomyelia presence is of questionable clinical significance, as the difference between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups is too small to be measured in a clinical setting.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitchell, Thomas J</author><author>Knowler, Susan P</author><author>van den Berg, Henny</author><author>Sykes, Jane</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syringomyelia: determining risk and protective factors in the conformation of the  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>9</pages><volume>1</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>26401326</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/2052-6687-1-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia (SM) is a painful neurological condition, prevalent in  brachycephalic toy breeds including the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). In these breeds, SM is typically secondary to Chiari-like Malformation (CM). There has been much debate in the scientific and veterinary communities to what extent head shape is indicative of either pathology, especially as certain craniosynostosis syndromes in humans (highly associated with CM) have characteristic facial and cranial morphologies. Elucidating a risk morphology would allow for selection away from these traits and proffer further breeding guidelines for the condition. Dogs were measured in multiple countries by means of a standardised bony landmark measuring protocol and photo analysis by blinded, trained researchers. RESULTS: The results found two significant risk factors in the conformation of the CKCS: extent of brachycephaly and distribution of cranium. The study identified a greater amount of cranium distributed caudally (relative to the amount distributed rostrally) to be significantly protective against syrinx development at the levels of three years of age, five years of age and when comparing a sample of SM clear individuals over the age of five to those affected younger than three years of age. A decreased cephalic index (decreasing brachycephaly) was significantly protective at the latter level. Cephalic index and caudal cranium distribution exhibited a negative, linear relationship. Cephalic index demonstrated a positive linear relationship with the amount of doming of the head. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a risk phenotype of brachycephaly with resulting rostrocaudal doming that is more rostrally distributed and hence sloping caudally. The results of this study may allow for selection against risk aspects of conformation in the CKCS in combination with the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club CM/SM scheme to enable reduction in CM/SM incidence. Further research comparing this external risk phenotype to the internal presentation upon MRI would determine how these features are indicative of syrinx development. Utilising breeds in which CM free individuals are more available may allow for validation of this risk phenotype for CM or determine alternatives.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martinod, S</author><author>Laurent, N</author><author>Moreau, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resistance and immunity of dogs against Babesia canis in an endemic area.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary parasitology</full-title></periodical><pages>245-254</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Protozoan</keyword><keyword>Babesia</keyword><keyword>Babesiosis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>France</keyword><keyword>Immunity, Active</keyword><keyword>Immunity, Innate</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3705420</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0304-4017(86)90072-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine babesiosis is increasing in incidence and prevalence in some areas in  France and is now a major problem for dogs.

The study aimed to investigate for the first time the prevalence, breed-based risk factors and clinical management of CUD in the general population of dogs under primary veterinary care in England. RESULTS: Of 104,233 dogs attending 110 clinics participating within the VetCompass Programme from January 1(st) to December 31(st) 2013, there were 834 confirmed CUD cases (prevalence: 0.80%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-0.86). Breeds with the highest prevalence included Pug (5.42% of the breed affected), Boxer (4.98%), Shih Tzu (3.45%), Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (2.49%) and Bulldog (2.41%). Purebred dogs had 2.23 times the odds (95% CI 1.84-2.87, P &lt; 0.001) of CUD compared with crossbreds. Brachycephalic types had 11.18 (95% CI 8.72-14.32, P &lt; 0.001) and spaniel types had 3.13 (95% CI 2.38-4.12, P &lt; 0.001) times the odds for CUD compared with crossbreds. Pain was recorded in 385 (46.2%) cases and analgesia was used in 455 (54.6%) of dogs. Overall, 62 (7.4%) cases were referred for advanced management and CUD contributed to the euthanasia decision for 10 dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Breeds such as the Pug and Boxer, and conformational types such as brachycephalic and spaniels, demonstrated predisposition to CUD in the general canine population. These results suggest that breeding focus on periocular conformation in predisposed breeds should be considered in order to reduce corneal disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zur, Gila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bilateral ear canal neoplasia in three dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>276-280</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Ear, External</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16101799</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-3164.2005.00449.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Bilateral ear canal infections are common in dogs. Ear canal neoplasia is usually  associated with unilateral problems, and is uncommon in dogs. To the best of the author's knowledge, bilateral aural neoplasia has not been reported in dogs, and only four case reports were found in the human literature. This report presents three dogs that had bilateral tumours in their ear canals. They were presented with bilateral otitis externa. All three dogs exhibited tissue proliferation of both ear canals that did not respond to glucocorticoids. Treatment consisted of total ear canal ablation, and tissues were submitted for histopathological evaluation. Case # 1 (a 10-year-old, male cocker spaniel) was diagnosed as ceruminious gland carcinoma. Cases # 2 and 3 were diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Case # 1 was diagnosed 4 years earlier as having keratinization disorder, which was causing its chronic ear problems. Case # 2 (a 5-year-old, female French bulldog) was diagnosed 4 years earlier as having atopic dermatitis, which did not respond to hyposensitization, and only partially responded to glucocorticoids therapy. Case # 3 (a 9-year-old, male German shepherd) was diagnosed by the referring veterinarian as having unilateral ear canal proliferation 2 months prior to presentation. However, otoscopic examination showed bilateral proliferation that obstructed both canals. In summary, bilateral ear canal neoplasia should be considered in cases of nonresponsive, proliferative aural pathology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Martin J</author><author>Kolecka, Malgorzata</author><author>Kirberger, Robert</author><author>Hartmann, Antje</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Demonstrates  Reduced Periventricular Cerebral Blood Flow in Dogs with Ventriculomegaly.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>137</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28879204</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2017.00137</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The nature of ventriculomegaly in dogs is still a matter of debate. Signs of  increased intraventricular pressure and atrophy of the cerebral white matter have been found in dogs with ventriculomegaly, which would imply increased intraventricular pressure and, therefore, a pathological condition, i.e., to some extent. Reduced periventricular blood flow was found in people with high elevated intraventricular pressure. The aim of this study was to compare periventricular brain perfusion in dogs with and without ventriculomegaly using perfusion weighted-magnetic-resonance-imaging to clarify as to whether ventriculomegaly might be associated with an increase in intraventricular pressure. Perfusion was measured in 32 Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) with ventriculomegaly, 10 CKCSs were examined as a control group. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using free-hand regions of interest (ROI) in five brain regions: periventricular white matter, caudate nucleus, parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. CBF was significantly lower in the periventricular white matter of the dogs with ventriculomegaly (p = 0.0029) but not in the other ROIs. Reduction of periventricular CBF might imply increase of intraventricular pressure in ventriculomegaly.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Okine, Ayeley A K</author><author>Chapman, Seth</author><author>Hostutler, Roger A</author><author>Livingston, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia in a 2-year-old King Charles Cavalier Spaniel  using the polymerase chain reaction.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>146-149</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29575136</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12563</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 2-year-old, female spayed, King Charles Cavalier Spaniel was presented for  evaluation of dyspnea, inappetence, and lethargy.

METHODS: DNA samples from 21 cases/parents were collected. Canine candidate genes (CCGs) for similar inherited human diseases were chosen. Twenty-eight candidate genes were identified by searching the Pubmed OMIM database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim). Canine orthologues of human candidate genes were identified using the Ensembl orthologue prediction facility (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Two microsatellites flanking each candidate gene were selected, and primers to amplify each microsatellite were designed using the Whitehead Institute primer design website (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). The microsatellites associated with all 28 CCGs were genotyped on a panel of 21 DNA samples from CKCS dogs (13 affected and eight carriers). Genotyping data was analyzed to identify markers homozygous in affected dogs and heterozygous in carriers (homozygosity mapping). RESULTS: None of the microsatellites associated with 25 of the CCGs displayed an association with CKCSID in the 21 DNA samples tested. Three CCGs associated microsatellites were monomorphic across all samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five CCGs were excluded as cause of CKCSID. Three CCGs could not be excluded from involvement in the inheritance of CKCSID.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>JAMES, O D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prolapse of the bladder in spaniel bitch.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>294</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1951</year></dates><accession-num>14836331</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.63.17.294</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mellanby, R J</author><author>Stell, A</author><author>Baines, E</author><author>Chantrey, J C</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Panniculitis associated with pancreatitis in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>24-28</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoma</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Chemical Analysis</keyword><keyword>Cellulitis</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis</keyword><keyword>Panniculitis</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12570349</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00100.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 13-year-old, male cocker spaniel presented with a history of inappetence,  depression and reluctance to stand. The dog had multiple, ulcerated skin lesions which were diagnosed as panniculitis by histopathology. A diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on the basis of markedly elevated serum lipase concentrations, abdominal ultrasonography which showed an abnormal lobulated area of hypoechoic tissue in the body and right lobe of the pancreas, and a fine needle biopsy from this area which revealed large numbers of degenerate neutrophils. After treatment with antibiotics and prednisolone, the dog made a full clinical recovery and was free of clinical signs for four months. The dog was euthanased five months later and postmortem examination revealed chronic, active pancreatitis and a pancreatic adenoma.

Hereditary retinal degeneration, often called progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), is prevalent in dogs with disease entities comparable to human retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). Recent molecular studies in the English Springer Spaniel (ESS) dog have shown that PRA cases are often homozygous for a mutation in the RPGRIP1 gene, the defect also causing human RP, LCA, and cone rod dystrophies. The present study characterizes the disease in a group of affected ESS in USA, using clinical, functional, and morphological studies. An objective evaluation of retinal function using electroretinography (ERG) is further performed in a masked fashion in a group of American ESS dogs, with the examiner masked to the genetic status of the dogs. Only 4 of 6 homozygous animals showed clinical signs of disease, emphasizing the need and importance for more precise studies on the clinical expression of molecular defects before utilizing animal models for translational research, such as when using stem cells for therapeutic intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lai, Serene R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atrioventricular muscular dystrophy in a 5-month-old English springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>1286-1287</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscular Dystrophy, Animal</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>20190980</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Primary persistent atrial standstill due to atrioventricular muscle dystrophy is  a rare familial disease in dogs.

ANIMALS: Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n = 6) and age-matched mixed breed (n = 6) with severe myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), and normal mixed breed (n = 4) dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry staining and qualitative and quantitative analysis of mitral valves sections, examining for the presence of CD11c and CD45, vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and embryonic smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (Smemb), von Willebrand factor and CD31 and Ki-67. RESULTS: Vimentin positive cell numbers were increased in the MMVD dogs and distributed throughout the valve with greatest density close to the endothelium. There were no significant differences in cell marker expression for the two diseased groups, but cell numbers were significantly increased compared to controls for α-SMA (CKCS only) and Smemb (CKCS and mixed breed: p &lt; 0.05). Alpha smooth muscle actin+ cells were primarily located at the valve edge, with Smemb+ cells similarly located, but also present throughout the valve stroma. A small number of cells close to the valve edge co-expressed α-SMA and Smemb. Endothelial von Willebrand factor expression was identified in all valves, with evidence of disrupted endothelium in the diseased, but was also found in diseased valve stroma. There was no staining for CD11c, CD45 or CD31 in any valve. Ki-67+ cells formed linear clusters at the leaflet tip and were sparsely distributed throughout both myxomatous valve groups. CONCLUSIONS: The cellular changes notes with advanced stage MMVD appear similar for CKCS when compared to mixed breed dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Archer, Rebecca</author><author>Sissener, Thomas</author><author>Connery, Neil</author><author>Spotswood, Tim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Asymmetric lumbosacral transitional vertebra and subsequent disc protrusion in a  cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>301-304</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Laminectomy</keyword><keyword>Lumbosacral Region</keyword><keyword>Spinal Stenosis</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20514255</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 10-year-old cocker spaniel bitch presented with severe lumbosacral pain and  acute onset left pelvic limb lameness.

The study population included all dogs that had visited one of 16 veterinary practices located in Scotland between 2002 and early 2012. The overall prevalence of tail injuries in dogs visiting one of the 16 veterinary practices was 0.59 per cent. The prevalence of tail injuries in dogs of working breeds was estimated to be 0.90 per cent. Working dog breeds that were examined by a veterinary surgeon were at a significantly greater risk of sustaining a tail injury than non-working breeds (P&lt;0.001). To prevent one such tail injury in these working breeds approximately 232 dogs would need to be docked as puppies. To prevent one tail amputation in spaniels, 320 spaniel puppies would need to be docked. Spaniels presented after January 2009 were 2.3 times more likely to have a tail injury than those presented before April 29, 2007 (date of the legislation that banned tail docking in Scotland). Given the results of this and the accompanying paper it may be appropriate to consider changes to the current legislation for specific breeds of working dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sack, G H Jr</author><author>Cork, L C</author><author>Morris, J M</author><author>Griffin, J W</author><author>Price, D L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Autosomal dominant inheritance of hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy.</title><secondary-title>Annals of neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>369-373</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Spine</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6742782</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ana.410150411</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy ( HCSMA ) is a motor neuron disease in  Brittany spaniels. Three phenotypes are recognized (accelerated, intermediate, and chronic) and are distinguished on the basis of rate of progression and age at onset. Breeding studies within a kindred of more than 125 dogs (Brittany spaniel and beagle-Brittany outcrosses ) have established an autosomal dominant inheritance for HCSMA . Pups homozygous for the trait have accelerated disease whereas heterozygous dogs have intermediate or chronic disease. The reason for the two phenotypes in heterozygotes is under study. HCSMA provides a unique opportunity to study the genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms of a motor neuron disease, and findings may have broad relevance to investigations of autosomal dominant degenerative disorders of the central nervous system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plessas, I N</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Driver, C J</author><author>Chandler, K E</author><author>Craig, A</author><author>McGonnell, I M</author><author>Brodbelt, D C</author><author>Volk, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term outcome of Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs with clinical signs  associated with Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>501</pages><volume>171</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Amines</keyword><keyword>Analgesics</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Carbazoles</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gabapentin</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Pregabalin</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>gamma-Aminobutyric Acid</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23100307</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.100449</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The disease complex Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) has been  associated with the development of neuropathic pain (NeP), and commonly affects Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). This prospective cohort study followed 48 CKCSs with CM and/or SM and clinical signs suggestive of NeP for a period of 39 (±14.3) months from diagnosis. At the end of the study, 36 dogs were still alive; five dogs died of an unrelated or unknown cause, and seven were euthanased due to severe clinical signs suggestive of NeP. During the follow-up period, the clinical signs of scratching, facial rubbing behaviour, vocalisation and exercise ability were evaluated. Nine out of 48 dogs stopped scratching (P&lt;0.001), but there was no statistically significant change in the number of dogs exhibiting exercise intolerance, vocalisation or facial rubbing behaviour. The overall severity of clinical signs based on a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 mm: no clinical signs 100 mm: severe clinical signs) increased (from median 75 mm (interquartile ranges (IQR) 68-84) to 84 mm (IQR 71.5-91), P&lt;0.001). A quarter of the dogs were static or improved. In general, the majority of the owners felt that the quality of life of their dogs was acceptable. Medical treatments received were gabapentin or pregabalin and/or intermittently, carprofen. The owner's perception of their animal's progress, and progress based on VAS, had strong positive correlation (Spearman's rank correlation (s(r)) 0.74, P&lt;0.001). Overall, this study suggests that clinical signs suggestive of NeP progress in three-quarters of CKCSs with CM and/or SM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerda-Gonzalez, S</author><author>Bibi, K F</author><author>Gifford, A T</author><author>Mudrak, E L</author><author>Scrivani, P V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Magnetic resonance imaging-based measures of atlas position: Relationship to  canine atlantooccipital overlapping, syringomyelia and clinical signs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>133-138</pages><volume>209</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atlanto-Occipital Joint</keyword><keyword>Cervical Atlas</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Spinal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26857868</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2016.01.008</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine atlantooccipital overlapping (AOO) is characterized by a decreased  distance between the dorsal arch of the atlas and the supraoccipital bone. Current diagnostic criteria for this condition are subjective and clinician-dependent; objective criteria are needed to allow a reliable and reproducible diagnosis in clinical and research settings and assess clinical significance. We propose four standardized MRI-based measurements to objectively assess the proximity of the atlas to the foramen magnum. Inclusion criteria for dogs in this study were bodyweight &lt;15 kg, age &gt;5 months, and availability of a complete MRI study performed with the craniocervical junction in extension. Exclusion criteria were space-occupying lesions and poor image quality (i.e. unclear bony margins). Measurements also included blinded determinations of skull type, presence of craniocervical junction anomalies and presence and severity of syringomyelia. Clinical status at the time of imaging was noted. Measurements were obtained in 271 dogs; these were reproducible and reliable. Findings varied by skull type: dolichocephalic dogs had smaller foramen magnum, whereas brachycephalic dogs had more cranially and dorsally positioned atlas bodies in comparison to the other skull types. Measurements also increased with increases in bodyweight. This study demonstrated a close association between AOO, syringomyelia and clinical signs. Toy and small breed dogs (including Cavalier King Charles spaniels) showed higher than previously reported prevalence of AOO; its occurrence was also associated with lower bodyweights within the study population of &lt;15 kg toy/small breed dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Vicente, F</author><author>Pinilla, M</author><author>McConnell, J F</author><author>Bernard, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surgical management of first caudal nerve root foraminal compression secondary to  intervertebral disc disease in a Cocker Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>74-78</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</keyword><keyword>Laminectomy</keyword><keyword>Radiculopathy</keyword><keyword>Spinal Nerve Roots</keyword><keyword>Tail</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>innervation</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22105313</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3415/VCOT-11-02-0031</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A nine-year-old spayed female Cocker Spaniel was investigated for an eight week  history of licking and rubbing at the tail base, dullness, and signs of pain on manipulation of the tail. Left-sided intraforaminal compression of the first caudal nerve root due to intervertebral disc disease was diagnosed by radiographic, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging examinations. The dog was nonresponsive to conservative medical therapy. A decompressive left-sided first-second caudal (Cd1-Cd2) foraminotomy was performed. Postoperative computed tomography confirmed surgical decompression of the involved nerve root. At the one month follow-up examination there was marked improvement in clinical signs. At two months, clinical signs were completely resolved and there was not any evidence of recurrence twelve months after surgery. Intervertebral disc disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with discomfort at the tail base or signs of pain on manipulation of the tail. Surgical decompression may be indicated for management of these cases. This is the first report of diagnosis and surgical management of caudal intervertebral disc disease by foraminotomy in the dog. Surgical decompression by foraminotomy may therefore be a treatment option for this condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez, R F</author><author>Innocent, G</author><author>Mould, J</author><author>Billson, F M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine keratoconjunctivitis sicca: disease trends in a review of 229 cases.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>211-217</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Corneal Ulcer</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17381766</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00185.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the disease patterns in dogs with keratoconjunctivitis  sicca referred to the University of Glasgow Small Animal Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study of 229 cases was carried out. RESULTS: There were 44 breeds in the study, with four breeds, English cocker spaniels, cavalier King Charles spaniels, West Highland white terriers and shih-tzus, making up 58 per cent of the cases. Among these four breeds, two breed-dependent disease patterns, one chronic and one acute, were identified. English cocker spaniels and West Highland white terriers had a mean age at onset of clinical signs of five years and one month and five years and six months, respectively, with more females affected than males. Clinical signs consisted predominantly of conjunctival hyperaemia and mucopurulent discharge, with a relatively low incidence of ulcerative keratitis. In contrast, cavalier King Charles spaniels and shih-tzus showed a more acute disease pattern with a biphasic age distribution at 0 to less than two years of age, and four to less than six and six to less than eight years of age, respectively, with more males affected than females and a significantly higher incidence of ulcerative keratitis in some cases resulting in corneal perforation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study reveals interbreed differences with respect to sex, age and risk of ulcerative keratitis which have not been detailed previously in a referral population.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Oliveira Filho, Jaires Gomes</author><author>Ferreira, Lorena Lopes</author><author>Sarria, André Lucio Franceschini</author><author>Pickett, John A</author><author>Birkett, Michael A</author><author>Mascarin, Gabriel Moura</author><author>de León, Adalberto A Pérez</author><author>Borges, Lígia Miranda Ferreira</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, infestation of susceptible  dog hosts is reduced by slow release of semiochemicals from a less susceptible host.</title><secondary-title>Ticks and tick-borne diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ticks and tick-borne diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>139-145</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzaldehydes</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Host Specificity</keyword><keyword>Insect Repellents</keyword><keyword>Methyl n-Butyl Ketone</keyword><keyword>Pheromones</keyword><keyword>Rabbits</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</keyword><keyword>Tick Infestations</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28340941</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.10.010</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Domestic dog breeds are hosts for the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus  sensu lato, but infestation levels vary among breeds. Beagles are less susceptible to tick infestations than English cocker spaniels due to enhanced production of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde that act as volatile tick repellents. We report the use of prototype slow-release formulations of these compounds to reduce the burden of R. sanguineus s. l. on English cocker spaniel dogs. Twelve dogs were randomly assigned to two groups with six dogs each. The treated group received collars with slow-release formulations of the compounds attached, while the control group received collars with clean formulations attached. Five environmental infestations were performed, with the number of ticks (at all stages) on the dogs being counted twice a day for 45days. The counts on the number of tick stages found per dog were individually fitted to linear mixed effects models with repeated measures and normal distribution for errors. The mean tick infestation in the treated group was significantly lower than in the control group. For larvae and nymphs, a decrease in tick infestation was observed at the fifth count, and for adults, lower average counts were observed in all counts. The compounds did not interfere with the distribution of the ticks on the body of the dogs, as a similar percentage of ticks was found on the anterior half of the dogs (54.5% for the control group and 56.2% for the treated group). The biological and reproductive parameters of the ticks were not affected by the repellents. This study highlights for the first time the potential use of a novel allomone (repellent)-based formulation for reduction of tick infestation on susceptible dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MAGRANE, W G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intussusception in a springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>348</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Intussusception</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1947</year></dates><accession-num>20256946</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sakamoto, Yumi</author><author>Sato, Keita</author><author>Ishikawa, Chieko</author><author>Kagawa, Yumiko</author><author>Nakayama, Tomohiro</author><author>Sakai, Manabu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term follow-up of portal vein thrombosis in an American Cocker Spaniel with  lobular dissecting hepatitis: a case report.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>319</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anticoagulants</keyword><keyword>Computed Tomography Angiography</keyword><keyword>Dalteparin</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis</keyword><keyword>Liver Cirrhosis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Portal Vein</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Venous Thrombosis</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34592989</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-021-03017-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Lobular dissecting hepatitis (LDH) is a rare form of canine liver  cirrhosis that may be accompanied by portal hypertension in American Cocker Spaniels. In human patients with liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication. However, PVT has not been reported in dogs with LDH. Herein, we describe the long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel with LDH. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered male American Cocker Spaniel presented with a 1-month history of severe abdominal effusion. The dog was histopathologically diagnosed with LDH and treated with low-dose prednisolone on day 14. On day 115, computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the portal vein. Therefore, the dog was subcutaneously administered with the anticoagulant dalteparin, and low-dose prednisolone was continued. As a follow-up for PVT, CTA examinations were performed on days 207, 515, 886, and 1168, and the dog's antithrombin and D-dimer levels were measured. Following anticoagulant therapy, the dog was confirmed to have gradually increased antithrombin activity and decreased D-dimer concentrations. In addition, although the thrombus was confirmed to be in the same area of the portal vein system by CTA, atrophy and increased CT values due to organization were observed during the follow-up period. The dog's condition remained stable without clinical signs until day 1112 when it developed hepatic encephalopathy. The dog died on day 1208. On postmortem examination, histopathologically, the liver showed marked bile duct hyperplasia and fibrosis with chronic thrombus in the portal vein. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrated that low-dose glucocorticoid combined with dalteparin allowed long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel with LDH.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernblad Tevell, Elisabeth</author><author>Bergvall, Kerstin</author><author>Egenvall, Agneta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sebaceous adenitis in Swedish dogs, a retrospective study of 104 cases.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>11</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Registries</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sebaceous Gland Diseases</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>Veterinary Medicine</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18501018</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1751-0147-50-11</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Sebaceous adenitis (SA) is an uncommon, immune mediated skin disease  in dogs. The aim was to retrospectively investigate SA in dogs in Sweden with respect to breed, sex and age distribution. A second aim was to retrospectively compare clinical signs in dogs with generalized SA and to estimate the survival after diagnosis in the English springer spaniel, standard poodle and the akita. METHODS: In total 34 Swedish veterinarians contributed with 104 clinically and histologically verified SA cases. Breed, gender and age at diagnosis were registered for each case. The degree of clinical signs at time for diagnosis and at follow-up and information about treatments, concurrent diseases and euthanasia were recorded for the springer spaniels, standard poodles and akitas using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 104 cases of SA were included; most cases were recorded for the springer spaniel (n = 25), standard poodle (n = 21) and the akita (n = 10). These three breeds, together with the lhasa apso and the chow-chow, were the most common when national registry data from the Swedish Board of Agriculture and Swedish Kennel Club were considered. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years. The proportion of males was 61%. When the springer spaniels, standard poodles and the akitas with generalized signs were compared (n = 51), the spaniels showed significantly more severe clinical signs than the poodles at diagnosis regarding alopecia, seborrhoea, pyoderma and the overall severity of clinical signs. At follow-up, the degree of clinical signs for otitis externa and pyoderma differed significantly between the breeds. The estimated median survival time was 42 months. In dogs where data regarding survival was available at the end of the study (n = 44), SA was reported to be the reason for euthanasia in 14 dogs, whereof 7 within 24 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The result of this study implicates that the English springer spaniel is a breed predisposed to SA and that it has more severe clinical signs than the standard poodle. A large proportion of the dogs (spaniel, poodle and akita) investigated regarding survival were reported to have been euthanized to great extent due to the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barnett, K C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital keratoconjunctivitis sicca and ichthyosiform dermatosis in the  cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>524-528</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Ichthyosis</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16961470</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00107.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To record a previously unreported congenital and hereditary condition  affecting the eyes and skin in the cavalier King Charles spaniel. METHODS: Nineteen cases (13 litters) were investigated, with particular reference to eye and skin clinical signs. In addition, five generation pedigrees were obtained and studied from all cases with the exception of one. RESULTS: The eye signs were due to keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a common ocular disease in the dog, but rarely of congenital origin. The skin signs were of an ichthyosiform dermatosis; ichthyosis being a rare skin disease in the dog. In human beings, ichthyosis is a similar disease, mainly inherited and with a neonatal onset, and sometimes accompanied by other developmental defects. In the cavalier King Charles spaniel, the coat abnormality was noted at birth by the breeders as a 'curly coat', with deterioration of the skin signs as the animal became adult. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: These two conditions occurring together in this breed is well recognised by some breeders but rarely by the veterinary profession. Successful treatment is not possible, although some improvement, particularly of the keratoconjunctivitis sicca, can be obtained. The probable hereditary nature of the condition is an important factor for control.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wright, J A</author><author>Brownlie, S E</author><author>Smyth, J B</author><author>Jones, D G</author><author>Wotton, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Muscle hypertonicity in the cavalier King Charles spaniel--myopathic features.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>511-512</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Muscle Rigidity</keyword><keyword>Muscle Tonus</keyword><keyword>Muscles</keyword><keyword>Physical Exertion</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3716135</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.118.18.511</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jolly, R D</author><author>Hartley, W J</author><author>Jones, B R</author><author>Johnstone, A C</author><author>Palmer, A C</author><author>Blakemore, W F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalised ceroid-lipofuscinosis and brown bowel syndrome in Cocker spaniel  dogs.</title><secondary-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>236-239</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>16031790</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00480169.1994.35830</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The ceroid-lipofuscinoses comprise a group of inherited storage diseases of human  beings and animals that are characterised by progressive neurodegenerative disease and the accumulation within cells of a fluorescent lipopigment.

The most widely used method for diagnosis of CHD is the ventrodorsal hip-extended radiologic view, commonly referred to as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) method. The method of the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP), an alternative technique that is based on hip joint laxity, provides a quantitative assessment, the distraction index (DI), of the likelihood of the development of CHD because of increased laxity in the hip joint. Linear regression analysis showed that, across many breeds of dog, the incidence of CHD, as defined by the OFA, is positively correlated with the mean DI, the determination coefficient (r2) being 26%. We used families of Boykin spaniels (BSs) to determine the level of joint laxity in the breed and to conduct an initial whole-genome screening to identify markers that co-segregate with increased joint laxity. Although there was a positive correlation between the incidence of hip dysplasia and increased joint laxity, we did not find significant linkage in the 28 BSs that underwent genotyping, likely owing to the small size of the pedigree.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Martin J</author><author>Volk, Holger</author><author>Klingler, Melanie</author><author>Failing, Klaus</author><author>Kramer, Martin</author><author>Ondreka, Nele</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of closure times for cranial base synchondroses in mesaticephalic,  brachycephalic, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>497-503</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Germany</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Skull Base</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>growth &amp;  development</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23782353</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.12072</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Premature closure of cranial base synchondroses has been proposed as the  mechanism for brachycephaly in dogs and caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare times of closure for cranial base synchondroses in mesaticephalic, brachycephalic, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging studies were retrieved for client-owned dogs less than 18 months of age. Breed, age, skull conformation, and the open or closed state of cranial base synchondroses were independently recorded by two observers. For dogs with a unanimous observer agreement, regression analysis was used to test effects of age and gender on the open or closed status of synchondroses and differences between groups. A total of 174 dogs were included in MRI interpretations and 165 dogs were included in the regression analysis. Statistically significant differences in closure time of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis were identified between brachycephalic and mesaticephalic dogs (P = 0.016), Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and mesaticephalic dogs (P &lt; 0.0001), and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and brachycephalic dogs (P = 0.014). Findings from the current study supported the theory that morphological changes leading to the skull phenotype of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniels could be due to an earlier closure of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, P J</author><author>Roulois, A J A</author><author>Scase, T</author><author>Johnston, P E J</author><author>Thompson, H</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and breed distribution of chronic pancreatitis at post-mortem  examination in first-opinion dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>609-618</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cause of Death</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17696987</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00448.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of canine chronic pancreatitis in  first-opinion practice and identify breed associations or other risk factors. METHODS: Three sections of pancreas were taken from 200 unselected canine post-mortem examinations from first-opinion practices. Sections were graded for inflammation, fibrosis and other lesions. Prevalence and relative risks of chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic diseases were calculated. RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis was 34 per cent omitting the autolysed cases. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, collies and boxers had increased relative risks of chronic pancreatitis; cocker spaniels had an increased relative risks of acute and chronic pancreatitis combined. Fifty-seven per cent of cases of chronic pancreatitis were classified histologically as moderate or marked. Forty-one per cent of cases involved all three sections. Dogs with chronic pancreatitis were more commonly female and overweight, but neither factor increased the relative risk of chronic pancreatitis. There were breed differences in histological appearances and 24.5 per cent of cases were too autolysed to interpret with an increased relative risk of autolysis in a number of large breeds. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic pancreatitis is a common, under-estimated disease in the first-opinion dog population with distinctive breed risks and histological appearances.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borges, Lígia Miranda Ferreira</author><author>de Oliveira Filho, Jaires Gomes</author><author>Ferreira, Lorena Lopes</author><author>Louly, Carla Cristina Braz</author><author>Pickett, John A</author><author>Birkett, Michael A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of non-host semiochemicals for the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus  sanguineus sensu lato (Acari: Ixodidae), from tick-resistant beagles, Canis lupus familiaris.</title><secondary-title>Ticks and tick-borne diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ticks and tick-borne diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>676-682</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Disease Susceptibility</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Host-Parasite Interactions</keyword><keyword>Pheromones</keyword><keyword>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</keyword><keyword>Tick Infestations</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26103925</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.05.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Studies have shown that the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato,  when fed on the beagle breed of dog, Canis lupus familiaris, development negatively affected in comparison with tick development after feeding on the English cocker spaniel breed. Thus leading to the suggestion that beagle dogs are be tick-resistant dogs. Behavioural studies have demonstrated that more ticks are attracted by extracts from cocker spaniels than from beagles and that the odour of beagles is a repellent. To test the hypothesis that resistant hosts produce repellent compounds, we undertook comparative chemical analysis on beagle odour and cocker spaniel extracts using coupled high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and also used Petri-dish and olfactometer behavioural assays to assess the response of ticks to identified non-host compounds. The beagle odour extracts contained almost three times as many chemical compounds as cocker spaniel samples. Several non-host compounds were identified, i.e. 2-hexanone, benzaldehyde, nonane, decane and undecane. In Petri-dish assays, 2-hexanone was repellent at 30 min at concentrations of 0.200 and 0.050 mg cm(-2), whilst at 10 min, the 0.100 mg cm(-2) concentration was repellent. Benzaldehyde repelled ticks at 30 min (0.200 mg cm(-2)) and at 5 min (0.050 mg cm(-2)). Undecane was repellent for R. sanguineus s.l. ticks for the first 5 min at the highest concentration tested. Nonane and decane did not show any significant repellency at any concentration or time evaluated. When 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde were combined, an increase in the repellency rate was observed, with activity comparable or better than N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET). In olfactometer bioassays, a 1:1 mixture of 2-hexanone:benzaldehyde and DEET were repellent for R. sanguineus s.l. adults at the concentration of 0.200 mg cm(-2). This study identified non-host semiochemicals that mediate avoidance of the beagle dog breed by R. sanguineus s.l. This finding may enable development of new approaches to control this tick.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polton, G A</author><author>Mowat, V</author><author>Lee, H C</author><author>McKee, K A</author><author>Scase, T J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed, gender and neutering status of British dogs with anal sac gland carcinoma.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>125-131</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>19754809</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1476-5829.2006.00100.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study details the breed, gender and neutering status of a large cohort of  British canine patients suffering from histologically confirmed anal sac gland carcinoma.

The underlying pathophysiology of the development and progression of syringes is currently unknown. The primary aim of the current study was to determine whether development of syringomyelia is accompanied by alterations in cerebrospinal fluid composition. Patient records of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like malformations, with or without concurrent syringomyelia, that had magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis between December 2004 and December 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. Total nucleated cell count per microliter, with differential count, red blood cell count per microliter, and protein concentration (g/l), were reviewed. Data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Spearman rank test was used to test association between cerebrospinal fluid composition and syrinx size, and the Fisher exact test was used to compare the presence of macrophages, reactive lymphocytes, and myelin. A P value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant for statistical tests. Dogs with syringomyelia had a higher total nucleated cell count (syringomyelia: 4/µl [range, 0-15/µl] vs. without syringomyelia: 2/µl [0-8/µl]; P  =  0.0047), higher protein concentration (syringomyelia: 0.26 g/l [0.07-0.42 g/l] vs. without syringomyelia: 0.2 g/l [0.12-0.39 g/l]; P  =  0.039), and an increased neutrophil percentage (syringomyelia: 0% [0-37%] vs. without syringomyelia: 0% [0-21%]; P  =  0.0203) than those with the Chiari-like malformation alone. There was a positive correlation between total nucleated cell count and syrinx size (r  =  0.51; P  =  0.0068). Development of syringomyelia is accompanied by alterations in cerebrospinal fluid composition. The pathogenesis of syringomyelia has not been fully elucidated; therefore, the exact origin of cerebrospinal fluid changes remains unclear.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bell, R</author><author>Mooney, C T</author><author>Mansfield, C S</author><author>Jones, B R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treatment of insulinoma in a springer spaniel with streptozotocin.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>247-250</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibiotics, Antineoplastic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Insulinoma</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Streptozocin</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15909449</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2005.tb00318.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An eight-year-old, female springer spaniel was treated for metastatic insulinoma  with a single intravenous dose of 500 mg/m2 streptozotocin (SZN), and pre- and post-treatment diuresis. A tapering dose of corticosteroids was also administered over a 28 day period. SZN and corticosteroid administration resulted in resolution of hypoglycaemia and subsequent development of diabetes mellitus. Further metastases caused cervical spinal pain and the dog was euthanased 118 days after SZN administration.

Cases presented with a congenitally abnormal (rough/curly) coat and signs of KCS from eyelid opening. Persistent scale along the dorsal spine and flanks with a harsh frizzy and alopecic coat was evident in the first few months of life. Ventral abdominal skin was hyperpigmented and hyperkeratinized in adulthood. Footpads were hyperkeratinized from young adulthood with nail growth abnormalities and intermittent sloughing. Long-term follow-up of cases (13/25) is described. Immunomodulatory/lacrimostimulant treatment had no statistically significant effect on Schirmer tear test results, although subjectively, this treatment reduced progression of the keratitis. Histopathological analysis of samples (skin/footpads/lacrimal glands/salivary glands) for three new cases was consistent with an ichthyosiform dermatosis, with no pathology of the salivary or lacrimal glands identified histologically. Pedigree analysis suggests the syndrome is inherited by an autosomal recessive mode.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selden, J R</author><author>Moorhead, P S</author><author>Koo, G C</author><author>Wachtel, S S</author><author>Haskins, M E</author><author>Patterson, D F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inherited XX sex reversal in the cocker spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Human genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>62-69</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>H-Y Antigen</keyword><keyword>Heterozygote</keyword><keyword>Karyotyping</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Follicle</keyword><keyword>Ovary</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Seminiferous Tubules</keyword><keyword>Spermatozoa</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6745927</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00270560</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Nine XX true hermaphrodites and two XX males were discovered in a family of  American cocker spaniels. The true hermaphrodites were partially-masculinized females with ovotestes; the XX males had malformed male external genitalia and cryptorchid aspermatogenic testes. Wolffian and Mullerian duct derivatives were present in both true hermaphrodites and XX males. All four sires of sex-reversed dogs were normal XY males; five of the dams were anatomically normal females and one was an XX true hermaphrodite. A second true hermaphrodite reproduced as a female, producing anatomically normal offspring. All matings that produced sex-reversed offspring were consanguineous. Matings of the parents of sex-reversed cocker spaniels to normal beagles with no family history of intersexuality produced only normal offspring. Examination of G-banded karyotypes of the affected animals, their parents, and siblings, revealed no structural anomalies of the chromosomes that were consistently associated with sex-reversal. In assays for serologically-detectable H-Y antigen, the group of XX true hermaphrodites and the group of XX males had mean levels of the antigen not significantly different from that in normal male controls. Female parents of sex-reversed dogs and some of their female siblings were typed H-Y antigen positive, but the mean level of the antigen in this group was less than that of normal male controls. It is proposed that XX sex reversal in cocker spaniels is due to a mutant gene which when homozygous in females, results in a level of H-Y antigen similar to that found in normal males and the gonads develop as ovotestes or testes. When the gene is heterozygous in females, the level of serologically-detectable H-Y antigen is lower than that found in normal males and the gonads develop as normal ovaries. The persistence of Mullerian structures in the presence of testicular tissue suggests that Mullerian inhibiting substance is deficient or ineffective in its action in this condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wright, J A</author><author>Smyth, J B</author><author>Brownlie, S E</author><author>Robins, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A myopathy associated with muscle hypertonicity in the Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>559-565</pages><volume>97</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Muscles</keyword><keyword>Muscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>3680644</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0021-9975(87)90006-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Clinical signs of electrically silent muscle hypertonicity are described in five  Cavalier King Charles dogs.

In humans with Chiari type I malformation (CM-I), abnormal pulsation of the cerebellum during the cardiac cycle has been documented and is pivotal to theories for the pathogenesis of syringomyelia (SM). In this retrospective study, cardiac-gated cine balanced fast field echo (bFEE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess pulsation of the brain in dogs and to objectively measure the degree of cerebellar pulsation with the neck in a flexed position. Overall, 17 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with CM, including eight with SM and nine without SM, were compared with six small breed control dogs. Linear regions of interest were generated for the length of cerebellar herniation from each phase of the cardiac cycle and the degree of cerebellar pulsation was subsequently calculated. Age, bodyweight and angle of neck flexion were also compared. CKCS with CM and SM had significantly greater pulsation of the cerebellum than control dogs (P=0.003) and CKCS with CM only (P=0.031). There was no significant difference in age, bodyweight and angle of neck flexion between the three groups. Cardiac-gated cine bFEE MRI permitted the dynamic visualisation of cerebellar pulsation in dogs. These findings support the current theories regarding the pathogenesis of SM secondary to CM and further highlight the similarities between canine CM and human CM-I.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Houlton, J E F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A survey of gundog lameness and injuries in Great Britain in the shooting seasons  2005/2006 and 2006/2007.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>231-237</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sports</keyword><keyword>Tail</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18536849</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The aim of this paper was to record the types of injuries and causes of lameness  exhibited by dogs involved in game shooting. The study investigated gundogs that worked in the seasons 2005/2006 and 2006/2007. Information was acquired by owner questionnaires. The dogs were classified as working in the beating line, as peg dogs or as picking up dogs. A further group comprised Setters and Pointers that worked the grouse moors. A secondary objective was to assess the incidence of injuries that were treated by owners without seeking the assistance of their veterinarian, and to identify those that may have been underestimated. Depending on whether a dog was injured or went lame, and, if so, the nature of the injury, was correlated with the number of days worked, where it worked, its breed and the type of work it did. A mildly positive association between the Spaniel breed group and injuries was seen in 2005/2006 but not in 2006/2007. However, the relationship between the type of work and injuries was very significant for both seasons with dogs working in the beating line being at greatest risk and Setters and Pointers having the least number of injuries. The dogs in the beating line were also at a significantly greater risk of injury in both years when the type of injury was investigated. Fifty-three percent of all injuries were deemed to be sufficiently minor, that veterinary attention was not sought. However, those dogs with proximal thoracic limb lameness may have been under-investigated. There was a highly significant association between tail injuries and undocked Springer and Cocker Spaniels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leidinger, E F</author><author>Freeman, K</author><author>Kirtz, G</author><author>Hooijberg, E H</author><author>Sick, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed related odds ratio and anatomic distribution of canine mast cell tumours in  Austria.

The incidence of MCTs for registered breeds in Austria, an estimate of the risk by means of the odds ratios based on breed as well as the anatomic localisation of MCTs were examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the first part of the study, the ranking of breeds in Austria based on 147,802 dogs with known breed (including mixed breed) was determined, based on those dogs included in the laboratory data base from 2000 to 2010. In the second part of the study, 476 dogs were identified with MCTs and analysed by age, sex, Patnaik grade of MCT and breed distribution. The odds ratios with confidence intervals were calculated for all breeds with skin tumours. RESULTS: The age distribution showed a peak in the age group from 6.1 to 8.0 years; 70% of MCTs were localised to the head and trunk. No significant difference was found based on gender. The evaluation of the odds ratios showed that only four of the 20 of the most popular in Austria breeds (Boxer, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, Spaniel) had an increased risk; on the other hand, some breeds which have not been previously identified in the literature were indicated to have a significantly increased risk for MCT (e.g., Dogo Argentino, Tibetan Spaniel, Pyrenean Mountain Dog, Beauceron, and Austrian Smooth-haired Hound).

The concentration of alpha-tocopherol was measured by high performance liquid chromatography in plasma samples obtained from the affected dogs and from 28 ophthalmoscopically normal, healthy control dogs. The mean (sd) plasma alpha-tocopherol concentration in the normal dogs was 20.2 (7.1) microg/ml, compared with 1.14 (0.67) microg/ml in the 11 affected cocker spaniels. The difference between the two groups remained highly significant when the alpha-tocopherol concentrations were expressed relative to the concentrations of the plasma lipids cholesterol and triglycerides. Low plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol were observed in the four affected dogs of other breeds, but the finding was not so consistent. The plasma lipid concentrations were normal in the affected dogs. The deficiency of alpha-tocopherol in the affected dogs appeared to be primary, because there was no clinical, biochemical or pathological evidence of underlying disease, or any indication of a dietary deficiency which might have contributed to the low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, J P</author><author>McLean, R H</author><author>Cork, L C</author><author>Winkelstein, J A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic analysis of an inherited deficiency of the third component of complement  in Brittany spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>American journal of medical genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of medical genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>557-562</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Complement C3</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Linkage</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens</keyword><keyword>Major Histocompatibility Complex</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3789016</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ajmg.1320250319</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Genetically determined C3 deficiency in Brittany spaniel dogs shares a number of  biochemical and clinical characteristics with the human disorder. In humans, the gene for C3 deficiency is a null gene that is allelic to the structural gene for C3 and is not linked to the major histocompatibility locus. The current study used allotype analysis of canine C3 in order to demonstrate that the gene for C3 deficiency in these dogs is also a null gene allelic to the structural gene for C3. In addition, preliminary pedigree analysis suggests that the gene for canine C3 deficiency is apparently not closely linked to the major histocompatibility complex of the dog. Thus, it appears that C3 deficiency in Brittany spaniel dogs not only shares biochemical and clinical features with C3 deficiency in humans, but also shares some genetic characteristics with the human disorder.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bailey, T R</author><author>Holmberg, D L</author><author>Yager, J A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nasal dermoid sinus in an American cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>213-215</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermoid Cyst</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11265192</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An American cocker spaniel was presented for a subcutaneous mass and draining  tract located between its eyes.

The age of the dogs ranged from 3 months to 14 years (median: 4.75 years) and they included 45 males and 55 females. Cocker spaniels, Jura des Alpes and Brittany spaniels were significantly overrepresented among dogs with OE when compared to the hospital canine population. In the majority of the cases, OE was chronic-recurrent (63%) or bilateral (93%). Allergic dermatitis (43/100 dogs), grass awns (12/100) and otoacariasis (7/100) were the most common primary causative factors; no primary factor could be incriminated in 32 cases and more than one was found in three dogs. Malassezia spp. (66/100 dogs), cocci (38/100) and rods (22/100) were the secondary causative factors, while ear canal stenosis (38/100) and tympanic membrane perforation-otitis media (25/100) were the most important perpetuating factors. Atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions-associated OE was more common in females and dogs with a history of pruritic skin disease, while grass awn-induced OE occurred in cocker spaniels and acute cases. Tympanic membrane perforation was less frequent in atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions-associated OE, but more common when otoscopic and ear canal cytological examination revealed the presence of grass awns and rods, respectively. Finally, cocci overgrowth was positively associated with ear canal stenosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, Nicole R</author><author>Zele, Andrew J</author><author>Vingrys, Algis J</author><author>Stanley, Robin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variation in intraocular pressure following application of tropicamide in three  different dog breeds.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>8-11</pages><volume>10 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Intraocular Pressure</keyword><keyword>Mydriatics</keyword><keyword>Ophthalmic Solutions</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Tonometry, Ocular</keyword><keyword>Tropicamide</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17973829</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00485.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To record intraocular pressure (IOP) of three different dog breeds  following administration of one drop of 1% tropicamide. ANIMALS: Three dog breeds -- Golden Retrievers (n = 20), Siberian Huskies (n = 20) and English Cocker Spaniels (n = 36) -- were studied. PROCEDURE: IOPs were measured using a Tonopen following corneal anesthesia with a single drop of 0.5% proxymetacaine. A drop of 0.5% tropicamide was then administered bilaterally and a second IOP measurement was taken 30 min later (postdilation). The difference between the two measurements was considered as the effect of mydriasis on IOP. RESULTS: Dogs had an average IOP of 14.9 +/- 3.2 mmHg, with 95% confidence limits ranging from 8 to 22 mmHg. There were significant differences between breeds (P &lt; 0.006) with Siberian Huskies having higher IOPs (17.2 +/- 3.7 mmHg) than the other breeds (Spaniels: 14.2 +/- 2.8 mmHg, P &lt; 0.01; Retrievers: 14 +/- 1.9 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001). The majority (60%) of dogs displayed 5 mmHg or less in IOP change postmydriasis. Siberian Huskies showed the highest IOP levels, and also had the greatest variability with dilation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interbreed variability in effect of tropicamide of canine IOP is evident.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giger, U</author><author>Reilly, M P</author><author>Asakura, T</author><author>Baldwin, C J</author><author>Harvey, J W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Autosomal recessive inherited phosphofructokinase deficiency in English springer  spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>15-23</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Erythrocytes</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes, Recessive</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinase-1</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>2940948</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2052.1986.tb03184.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Three families of English springer spaniel dogs with phosphofructokinase (PFK)  deficiency causing haemolysis were studied. Four male dogs and one female dog with chronic haemolysis and haemolytic crises were found to have markedly reduced PFK activity in erythrocytes (8-20% of control English springer spaniels). PFK-deficient erythrocytes exhibited an extreme alkaline and sucrose lysis. The oxygen dissociation curve of erythrocyte suspensions was shifted to the left with a 50% saturation of haemoglobin at a partial oxygen pressure of 16-17 mmHg (normal 26-31 mmHg). Muscle wasting and mildly increased serum creatine phosphokinase activity were also noted. Six clinically normal first degree relatives of affected dogs had erythrocyte PFK activities that were 38-51% of controls. In these family members, there was an erythrocytosis and mild reticulocytosis probably due to a mildly enhanced haemoglobin-oxygen affinity but no increase in serum creatine phosphokinase. These studies confirm the familial nature of muscle-type PFK deficiency in English springer spaniels and support the conclusion that this animal model of the human glycogen storage disease type VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Milner, H R</author><author>Newington, A N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Longitudinal colonic torsion as a cause of tenesmus in an adult Irish Water  Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>40-43</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15768081</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00480169.2004.36389</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE HISTORY: Torsion of the descending colon was diagnosed by barium enema  radiography in an adult Irish Water Spaniel which had presented with tenesmus of 24 h duration.

The 182 cases comprised 61% of all foreign body-related cases during that year. Compared with the total hospital population, there was an increased prevalence of grass awn problems in the Springer Spaniel, Golden Retriever, Brittany Spaniel, and Airedale Terrier, but a decreased prevalence in German Shepherd Dogs, Miniature Poodles, and Dachshunds. The most common site of grass awn localization was the external ear canal, involving 51% of grass awn cases. Other common sites of grass awn localization included the interdigital webs, eye, nose, lumbar area, and thoracic cavity. Only 8 of the 182 animals were cats and 7 of the 8 had ocular involvement.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Egenvall, A</author><author>Hagman, R</author><author>Bonnett, B N</author><author>Hedhammar, A</author><author>Olson, P</author><author>Lagerstedt, A S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed risk of pyometra in insured dogs in Sweden.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>530-538</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Geography</keyword><keyword>Insurance</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>Uterine Diseases</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11817057</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2001)015&lt;0530:bropii&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An animal insurance database containing data on over 200,000 dogs was used to  study the occurrence of pyometra with respect to breed and age during 1995 and 1996 in Swedish bitches &lt;10 years of age. A total of 1,803 females in 1995 and 1,754 females in 1996 had claims submitted because of pyometra. Thirty breeds with at least 800 bitches insured each year were studied using univariate and multivariate methods. The crude 12-month risk of pyometra for females &lt;10 years of age was 2.0% (95% confidence interval = 1.9-2.1%) in 1995 and 1.9% (1.8-2.0%) in 1996. The occurrence of pyometra differed with age, breed, and geographic location. The risk of developing pyometra was increased (identified using multivariate models) in rough Collies, Rottweilers, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Golden Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and English Cocker Spaniels compared with baseline (all other breeds, including mixed breed dogs). Breeds with a low risk of developing the disease were Drevers, German Shepherd Dogs, Miniature Dachshunds, Dachshunds (normal size), and Swedish Hounds. Survival rates indicate that on average 23-24% of the bitches in the databases will have experienced pyometra by 10 years of age. In the studied breeds, this proportion ranged between 10 and 54%. Pyometra is a clinically relevant problem in intact bitches, and differences related to breed and age should be taken into account in studies of this disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stern-Bertholtz, W</author><author>Sjöström, L</author><author>Håkanson, N Wallin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary secretory otitis media in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel: a review of  61 cases.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>253-256</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>Tympanic Membrane</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12831101</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00151.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Sixty-one episodes of primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) were diagnosed in 43  Cavalier King Charles spaniels over a 10-year period. The principal findings were signs of moderate to severe pain localised to the head or cervical area, and/or neurological signs. Diagnosis was made by examination of the tympanic membrane and middle ear with the aid of an operating microscope under general anaesthesia. A bulging, but intact, tympanic membrane was found in most cases. Following myringotomy, a highly viscous mucus plug was found filling the middle ear. Treatment, consisting of removal of the mucus plug, flushing of the middle ear, and local and systemic medical therapy, had to be repeated between one and five times. The prognosis was good in all cases. PSOM is an important differential diagnosis in Cavalier King Charles spaniels with signs of pain involving the head and neck, and/or neurological signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandøe, P</author><author>Kondrup, S V</author><author>Bennett, P C</author><author>Forkman, B</author><author>Meyer, I</author><author>Proschowsky, H F</author><author>Serpell, J A</author><author>Lund, T B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Why do people buy dogs with potential welfare problems related to extreme  conformation and inherited disease?

Using a survey of owners of two popular breeds with extreme physical features (French Bulldog and Chihuahua), one with a high load of inherited diseases not directly related to conformation (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), and one representing the same size range but without extreme conformation and with the same level of disease as the overall dog population (Cairn Terrier), we investigated this seeming paradox. We examined planning and motivational factors behind acquisition of the dogs, and whether levels of experienced health and behavior problems were associated with the quality of the owner-dog relationship and the intention to re-procure a dog of the same breed. Owners of each of the four breeds (750/breed) were randomly drawn from a nationwide Danish dog registry and invited to participate. Of these, 911 responded, giving a final sample of 846. There were clear differences between owners of the four breeds with respect to degree of planning prior to purchase, with owners of Chihuahuas exhibiting less. Motivations behind choice of dog were also different. Health and other breed attributes were more important to owners of Cairn Terriers, whereas the dog's personality was reported to be more important for owners of French Bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels but less important for Chihuahua owners. Higher levels of health and behavior problems were positively associated with a closer owner-dog relationship for owners of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Chihuahuas but, for owners of French Bulldogs, high levels of problems were negatively associated with an intention to procure the same breed again. In light of these findings, it appears less paradoxical that people continue to buy dogs with welfare problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gelatt, Kirk N</author><author>MacKay, Edward O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of the breed-related glaucomas in pure-bred dogs in North America.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>97-111</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>14982589</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2004.04006.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the breed-related glaucomas in  pure-bred dogs presented to the veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America that participate in the Veterinary Medical Data Base (VMDB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, age of first diagnosis, breed, and gender data for all breeds of dogs were collected from the VMDB with the clinical diagnosis of primary glaucoma (glaucoma-NOS) at 5-10 year intervals from 1964 to 2002. The prevalence for each breed (affected dogs compared to all dogs of each breed), any changes over the 38 years, and any gender differences for these glaucomas were determined. RESULTS: The prevalence of the primary breed-related glaucomas has gradually increased from 0.29% (1964-1973); 0.46% (1974-1983); 0.76% (1984-1993); to 0.89% (1994-2002). Breeds that consistently featured among the highest 10 for glaucoma prevalence from four different periods (1964 to 2002) included American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Wire Fox Terrier, and Boston Terrier. During the last observation period (1994-2002), 22 different breeds had 1% or higher prevalence of the glaucomas. The highest prevalence of glaucomas in 1994-2002 by breed included: American Cocker Spaniel (5.52%); Basset Hound (5.44%); Chow Chow (4.70%); Shar-Pei (4.40%); Boston Terrier (2.88%); Wire Fox Terrier (2.28%); Norwegian ElkHound (1.98%); Siberian Husky (1.88%); Cairn Terrier (1.82%); and Miniature Poodle (1.68%). A predominance of females with glaucoma occurred in the American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Chow Chow, English Cocker Spaniel, Samoyed, and perhaps the Siberian Husky, and a predominance of males in the Australian Cattle dog and St Bernard. Age affected the time for first presentation of the glaucomas in the pure-bred dog. In the majority of breeds the glaucomas were presented for initial diagnosis in dogs between 4 and 10 years of age. CONCLUSION: Breed-related glaucomas in pure-bred dogs are frequently presented to the veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America. The prevalence of the breed-related glaucomas in the dog appears similar to humans, and in some breeds exceeds that in humans. In many breeds the high prevalence of the glaucomas suggests a genetic basis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>VOGEL, H H Jr</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social relations among Springer spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Anatomical record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Anatomical record</full-title></periodical><pages>625</pages><volume>99</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1947</year></dates><accession-num>18895423</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramadour, M</author><author>Guetat, M</author><author>Guetat, J</author><author>El Biaze, M</author><author>Magnan, A</author><author>Vervloet, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dog factor differences in Can f 1 allergen production.</title><secondary-title>Allergy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Allergy</full-title></periodical><pages>1060-1064</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Allergens</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens, Plant</keyword><keyword>Castration</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Seborrheic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hair</keyword><keyword>Hormones</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15969688</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00824.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The clinical importance of dog allergy is well known, but it is  unknown if all types of dogs represent the same risk for allergic patients. The purpose of this work was to evaluate among 288 healthy dogs if the levels of Can f 1 on fur vary between breeds (German Shepherd, Pyrenean Shepherd, Poodle, Cocker spaniel, Spaniel, Griffon, Labrador retriever and Yorkshire terrier), gender, hormonal status, hair length, and according to the presence of seborrhea. METHODS: Each dog was shaved in a limited area and Can f 1 concentrations were measured in mug/g fur by ELISA. The results (geometric mean values and 95% confidence intervals) were analyzed using analysis of variance and with nonparametric tests. RESULTS: A wide variability in Can f 1 levels was found between dog breeds, from Labradors [1.99 (0.03-129.91)] to Yorkshires [16.72 (3.67-76.16)] and Poodles [17.04 (2.79-103.94)] but only the Labrador levels were significantly different from each other breed. Males produced more Can f 1 than females, 11.75 (1.27-108.40) vs 8.89 (0.91-86.39). No difference was found according to hair length or hormonal status. The seborrheic status highly (P = 0.0019) influenced the presence of Can f 1 on hair: 16.66 (1.59-173.96) vs 9.40 (1.03-85.70). CONCLUSION: Breeds (Labrador retriever), sex and seborrhea seem to influence the levels of Can f 1 on fur.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Regnier, Alain</author><author>Raymond-Letron, Isabelle</author><author>Peiffer, Robert L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital orbital cysts of neural tissue in two dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>91-98</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Cysts</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Orbital Diseases</keyword><keyword>S100 Proteins</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18302573</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2008.00606.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-month-old English Cocker Spaniel and a 6-month-old miniature poodle presented  with clinical signs related to an abnormal right eye since birth. In both dogs, the right globe could not be identified and was replaced by a fluctuant intraorbital mass covered by a vascularized mucous membrane. Ultrasonography demonstrated that both masses were cystic structures markedly larger in size than the normal contralateral globes. In both cases, surgical excision revealed a multilobular cyst filling the whole orbital cavity. Histopathologic examination and immunostaining for glial fibrillary acid protein and S100 protein supported a diagnosis of neural cysts associated with ocular dysplasia. The definitive diagnosis was congenital cystic eye and microphthalmos with cyst for the Cocker Spaniel and miniature poodle, respectively. Karyotype was normal in both dogs. Congenital cystic eye and microphthalmos with cyst result from defects in early embryonic life that arise following formation of the optic vesicle and prior to closure of the optic fissure. To the authors' knowledge neither has been reported in the canine species. They should be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital cysts in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitcham, S A</author><author>Clark, E G</author><author>Mills, J H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Malignant thymoma with widespread metastases in a dog: case report and brief  literature review.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>280-282</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>17422426</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A malignant thymoma of epithelial type with metastases to the liver, spleen and  bone marrow in a 16 year old female Cocker Spaniel dog is described.

A posterior cortical cataract was noted in the right eye. At the owner's request the puppy was humanely destroyed, and a necropsy was performed. Upon sectioning the left globe in the vertical plane, a circle of pigmented strands of tissue was observed spanning the anterior chamber from the iris to the posterior aspect of the cornea. The right globe appeared normal when inspected grossly. Histologically, a membrane of pigmented tissue covered the posterior aspect of the broad central corneal leukoma of the left globe. This membrane and the cords traversing the anterior chamber were composed of vascular uveal tissue. Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium were reduced or absent in the zone of corneal opacity. Other than the changes associated with cataract, the right globe was histologically normal. The clinical and histological findings in the left globe were identical with those described for Peters&gt;&gt; anomaly in human beings.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nold, J B</author><author>Powers, B E</author><author>Eden, E L</author><author>McChesney, A E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ameloblastic odontoma in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>996-998</pages><volume>185</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Maxillary Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Odontogenic Tumors</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6511644</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An ameloblastic odontoma in the right maxilla of a 10-week-old, female Springer  Spaniel was treated by extensive curettage.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. ANIMALS: Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n=15). METHODS: After diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dogs had cranial cervical decompression with durotomy. Seven dogs had the durotomy patched with biocompatible collagen matrix. Clinical outcome was monitored for &gt;12 months. RESULTS: All dogs either improved (80%) or were unchanged (20%) postoperatively. Postoperative MRI in 6 dogs revealed persistence of syringomyelia. Seven dogs (47%) subsequently deteriorated, 0.2-2.3 years after surgery (mean, 1.3 years) and 2 dogs were eventually euthanatized as a consequence. Twelve dogs were still alive, 1-6.5 years after surgery (mean, 2.5 years). CONCLUSION: Cranial cervical decompression surgery is associated with low mortality and morbidity, and results in clinical improvement in most dogs. The procedure seemingly does not result in syrinx collapse and resolution. Clinical improvement may not be sustained and some dogs can be expected to deteriorate. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cranial cervical decompression surgery may have a role in management of CM/SM. In dogs with severe pain, it can improve quality of life for several years; however, it does not appear to adequately address the primary cause of syringomyelia. Further prospective study is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder. Because this condition causes neuropathic pain but does not necessarily result in euthanasia more information is needed on appropriate pain management for these patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cowan, Sara M</author><author>Bartges, Joseph W</author><author>Gompf, Rebecca E</author><author>Hayes, Jimmy R</author><author>Moyers, Tamberlyn D</author><author>Snider, Carolyn C</author><author>Gerard, David A</author><author>Craft, Robert M</author><author>Muenchen, Robert A</author><author>Carroll, Roger C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Giant platelet disorder in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Experimental hematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental hematology</full-title></periodical><pages>344-350</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bernard-Soulier Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Bleeding Time</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasmic Granules</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hair Color</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbreeding</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15050744</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exphem.2004.01.008</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, functional, and  morphologic characteristics of platelets in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs (Cavaliers). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood from 69 clinically normal Cavaliers was collected and anticoagulated with ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citrate. Automated and manual platelet counts were obtained. Percent platelet aggregation in response to ADP (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 microM) was determined. Electron microscopy was performed to examine platelet internal morphology and dense granule distribution. A cardiologist recorded the quality of murmurs. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/microL) was present in 51.43% (36/69) of Cavaliers. Macrothrombocytes (&gt;3 microm) were present in 33.33% (22/69). Mean manual platelet count was 118,770/microL. Manual (EDTA blood) and automated (EDTA and citrated blood) methods of platelet counting were correlated. Prevalence of cardiac murmurs was 38% (26/69). There was no association between affected dogs and murmur, signalment, or coat color. Mean percent platelet aggregation was significantly higher in controls than in Cavaliers (79% vs 38%, p=0.001). Response to ADP was unaffected by thrombocytopenia, macrothrombocytes, murmur, or any combination thereof. Platelet electron microscopy showed normal and giant sized platelets with normal internal morphology. CONCLUSIONS: A benign inherited giant platelet disorder affects approximately 50% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, macrothrombocytes, or decreased platelet aggregation in response to ADP. Platelet ultrastructure is normal. Citrated or EDTA blood provides accurate platelet counts. Further studies are indicated to determine platelet glycoprotein structure and any association with mitral endocardiosis. Cavaliers may be useful models of inherited giant platelet disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyers-Wallen, V N</author><author>Patterson, D F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>XX sex reversal in the American cocker spaniel dog: phenotypic expression and  inheritance.</title><secondary-title>Human genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>23-30</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ovary</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>3417302</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00451450</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study was conducted to define the range of phenotypic expression and mode of  inheritance of XX sex reversal in the cocker spaniel dog. Breeding experiments produced F1, F1BC, and F2 generations in which 29 XX true hermaphrodites and 3 XX males were defined by chromosome constitution, serial histologic sections of the gonads, and examination of the internal and external genitalia. In XX true hermaphrodites, the most common combination of gonads was bilateral ovotestes, followed by ovotestis and ovary, then ovotestis and testis. The amount of testicular tissue in the two gonads was closely correlated within each true hermaphrodite. The distribution of testicular tissue within ovotestes of true hermaphrodites was consistent with the hypothesis that testicular differentiation is initiated in the center of the gonad and spreads outward. XX males had bilateral aspermatogenic testes and the internal ducts and external genitalia were more masculinized than in true hermaphrodites. Results of breeding experiments are consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, the affected phenotype being expressed only in dogs with an XX chromosome constitution. The phenotypic expression and mode of inheritance of this disorder is compared to XX sex reversal in humans and other animals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Swenson, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic valvular disease in the cavalier King Charles spaniel in Sweden.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>549-553</pages><volume>131</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1481344</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The prevalence of chronic valvular disease was studied in 494 cavalier King  Charles spaniels with a mean (+/- sd) age of 3.0 +/- 2.7 years. Cardiac murmurs were detected in 65 (13.2 per cent) of the dogs. Among 61 cavalier King Charles spaniels with a mean age of 6.4 +/- 2.8 years, cardiac murmurs were detected in 32 (52 per cent). In both groups of dogs the prevalence of cardiac murmurs was low among dogs younger than three years (1.9 per cent) but increased with age (P &lt; 0.001). The estimated ages at which 50 per cent of the dogs had developed murmurs were 7.5 and 6.2 years, respectively. When 39 of the 61 dogs were re-examined three years later, cardiac murmurs were detected in 28 (72 per cent), and the intensities of the murmurs had generally increased (P &lt; 0.05). Nine (28 per cent) of the dogs which had previously had murmurs had been euthanased for signs of congestive heart failure whereas none of the dogs which had been free of murmurs had died from congestive heart failure. Animal insurance statistics from 1982 to 1990 (1983 excluded) for dogs less than 10 years old showed that claims for veterinary care or death or euthanasia were five times more common in the cavalier King Charles spaniel than in dachshunds (P &lt; 0.001) and eight times more common than the mean for all other insured breeds (P &lt; 0.001).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pitcher, G D C</author><author>Hahn, C N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atypical masticatory muscle myositis in three cavalier King Charles spaniel  littermates.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>226-228</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenal Cortex Hormones</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Masticatory Muscles</keyword><keyword>Myositis</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Trismus</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17381768</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00242.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This case report describes a novel manifestation of the immune-mediated disease,  masticatory muscle myositis.

All cases were diagnosed by the Surgical Pathology Service of the Laboratory of Pathology of the University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine, between January 1986 and March 1991. These cases were followed clinically to determine the accuracy of the initial histopathologic diagnosis. Data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test for discrete data and the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous data. A probability of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The following breeds were affected with pemphigus foliaceus: Akita, Brittany Spaniel, Chow Chow, Collie, Dachshund, Doberman Pinscher, English Cocker Spaniel, English Setter, Golden Retriever, Siberian Husky, Laborador Retriever, Miniature Schnauzer, Old English Sheepdog, Scottish Terrier, Chinese Shar Pei, Spitz, Shetland Sheep Dog, Weimeraner, and West Highland White Terrier. An increased risk of developing pemphigus foliaceus was noted in the Akita (OR = 37.8), English Springer Spaniel (OR = 20.7), Chow Chow (OR = 12.3), Chinese Shar Pei (OR = 7.9), and Collie (OR = 3.9). Pemphigus foliaceus had a higher average density of acantholytic cells (226 +/- 22.9) than superficial folliculitis (11.8 +/- 4.6), and acantholytic cells were 183 times more likely to be present in pemphigus foliaceus. The presence of rafts of acantholytic cells occurred in pemphigus foliaceus (23/50) more often than superficial folliculitis (1/47). Recornification and reformation of pustules were, respectively, 13.4 and 3.6 times more likely to occur in pemphigus foliaceus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Toole, D</author><author>Young, S</author><author>Severin, G A</author><author>Neumann, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retinal dysplasia of English springer spaniel dogs: light microscopy of the  postnatal lesions.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>298-311</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retina</keyword><keyword>Retinal Detachment</keyword><keyword>Retinal Diseases</keyword><keyword>blood supply</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year></dates><accession-num>6879955</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/030098588302000306</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The histologic features of retinal dysplasia were studied in 26 English springer  spaniel dogs of one day to four years of age. Dysplastic lesions in neonatal pups occurred predominantly in the peripapillary tapetal area of sensory retina. They consisted of complex linear folds and rosettes which were composed of hyperplastic neuroblasts. Dysplasia usually was not associated with incomplete differentiation of the outer neuroblastic layer. The outer limiting membrane was absent locally and numerous patent subretinal capillaries existed in the region of folds. The dysplastic features may be related to aberrant development of Muller cells and of retinal capillaries. In adolescent dogs, dysplastic lesions were less complex and usually were not accompanied by aberrant capillaries. Focal or complete retinal separation was present in some adolescent dogs. In adult dogs, features of retinal atrophy were found within dysplastic areas. No significant histologic lesions were found in the extraocular tissues of 12 affected dogs which were surveyed extensively.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Koch, J</author><author>Poulsen, K</author><author>Jensen, A L</author><author>Flagstad, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activation of the renin-angiotensin system in dogs with asymptomatic and mildly  symptomatic mitral valvular insufficiency.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>328-331</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Aldosterone</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Renin</keyword><keyword>Renin-Angiotensin System</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8531178</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.1995.tb01092.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The renin-angiotensin system has important pathophysiologic implications in the  development of congestive heart failure. The activity of the renin-angiotensin system early in the course of heart disease and heart failure in dogs was evaluated by measuring the plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in 18 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mitral valvular insufficiency, and in 18 healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. All dogs were unmedicated and had no other diseases. The PRA was high in the dogs with mitral valvular insufficiency (median 3.44 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 2.59 to 8.66 ng/mL/h) compared with the controls (median 2.51 ng/mL/h, interquartile interval 1.44 to 3.58 ng/mL/h). The PAC was also higher in the dogs with mitral insufficiency (median 53 pg/mL, interquartile interval 33 to 138 pg/mL) than in the control group (median 27 pg/mL, interquartile interval 11.5 to 54 pg/mL). However, there was considerable overlap between the 2 groups in both PRA and PAC. It was concluded from these data that there is early activation of the renin-angiotensin system in some Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with mitral valvular insufficiency. Further prospective studies are needed to determine if early intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will be valuable in this group of patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Tintera, J</author><author>Hájek, T</author><author>Horacek, J</author><author>Dezortova, M</author><author>Hájek, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Language lateralisation in schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science</full-title></periodical><pages>444; author reply 444-5</pages><volume>186</volume><keywords><keyword>Diseases in Twins</keyword><keyword>Functional Laterality</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Language</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology</keyword><keyword>Twins, Monozygotic</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15952266</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1192/bjp.186.5.444</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gooding, J P</author><author>Robinson, W F</author><author>Mews, G C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Echocardiographic characterization of dilatation cardiomyopathy in the English  cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1978-1983</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3767104</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The echocardiographic characterization of a dilatation cardiomyopathy in  small-breed dogs is reported. Twelve clinically healthy adult English Cocker Spaniel dogs (between 2 and 9 years old and weighing 11.5 to 15.4 kg [mean 12.9 +/- 1.00 kg]) from a kennel population with a history of cardiomyopathy were assessed, using M-mode echocardiography. The dogs were selected on ECG and/or radiographic evidence of ventricular enlargement. Nine dogs had R-wave amplitude in lead 11 of greater than 3.0 mV. Two dogs had an unusual right-axis deviation, the result of deep Q waves in the limb leads and deep S waves in chest leads CV6LL and CV6LU, indicating that there was right ventricular enlargement. All dogs had increased end-systolic dimensions (mean 3.0 +/- 0.6 cm). End-diastolic dimensions were increased in 9 dogs (mean 4.0 +/- 0.5 cm), and there was a decrease of left ventricular (LV) function as measured by fractional shortening in 8 dogs. Mean fractional shortening for the 12 dogs was 25.4 +/- 5.7%. There was significant correlation between LV dimensions and age at echocardiographic assessment, indicating that LV dilatation was progressive. Three of the oldest dogs had severe dilatation of the LV, and in 2 of these, LV function was severely decreased. Left ventricular function in the 3rd dog, however, was within the acceptable range. Fractional shortening and thickness of the LV caudal wall and interventricular septum were significantly correlated (P less than 0.01 for interventricular system and P less than 0.05 for LV caudal wall).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keller, C B</author><author>Lamarre, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inherited lysosomal storage disease in an English springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>194-195</pages><volume>200</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fucosidosis</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Peripheral Nerves</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1559875</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Alpha-L-fucosidosis was diagnosed in a 17-month-old English Springer Spaniel with  a history of slow development and progressive visual impairment.

Fourteen lesions were seen, commonly (11 of 14) within the gray matter of the cerebellar hemispheres or vermis. Thirteen lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images (in 11 dogs) and one was hypointense. Eleven of 14 lesions were within the region supplied by the rostral cerebellar artery or one of its main branches and there was no, or minimal, mass effect. Contrast enhancement was only seen in six lesions and was mild in all. Gradient-echo images provided additional information in two dogs. The appearance of infarction in dogs with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is similar to that in humans, and provided supportive evidence for the diagnosis of infarction in five dogs. The use of gradient-echo and DWI is recommended for the evaluation of suspected cerebrovascular accidents in dogs. Six of the 12 affected animals were spaniels or spaniel crosses, suggesting a possible breed predisposition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pratt, J N</author><author>Knottenbelt, C M</author><author>Welsh, E M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dermoid sinus at the lumbosacral junction in an English springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>24-26</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hindlimb</keyword><keyword>Laminectomy</keyword><keyword>Lumbosacral Region</keyword><keyword>Myelitis</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Spina Bifida Occulta</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>innervation</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10713979</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2000.tb03132.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A dermoid sinus was identified in a springer spaniel that presented with hindlimb  neurological deficits.

The dog's neurological status improved after treatment and this improvement was maintained over a five-month follow-up period.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pujar, S</author><author>Kothapalli, K S</author><author>Kirkness, E</author><author>Van Wormer, R H</author><author>Meyers-Wallen, V N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exclusion of Lhx9 as a candidate gene for Sry-negative XX sex reversal in the  American cocker spaniel model.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>452-454</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Homeodomain Proteins</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15814894</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/esi058</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>XX sex reversal is known in 17 breeds of dogs. In the American cocker spaniel, it  segregates as an autosomal recessive trait, and the affected animals lack the testis determining Sry gene. In the search for an autosomal gene that causes this trait, we considered the possibility of Lhx9, a gene encoding LIM homeobox containing transcription factor 9, as a candidate gene. An American cocker spaniel pedigree showing Sry-negative XX sex reversal phenotype was genotyped with an intronic Lhx9 microsatellite marker. Segregation of the Lhx9 marker in the pedigree indicated that a mutation in canine Lhx9 is not likely to be the cause of Sry-negative XX sex reversal. In addition, using the recently available 7.6X canine genomic sequence, we report the location and genomic organization of canine Lhx9.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Snead, E C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A case of bilateral renal lymphosarcoma with secondary polycythaemia and  paraneoplastic syndromes of hypoglycaemia and uveitis in an English Springer Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>139-144</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>19754769</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1476-5810.2005.00069.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Primary renal lymphosarcoma in dogs has rarely been reported.

The surgical outcomes were evaluated in association with the following variables: breed, sex, age of onset of the otitis externa, duration of the disease before the surgery was performed, treatment received for the otitis externa, the status of the ear and tympanic membrane at the time of the surgery, the culture results, and concurrent medical problems. The outcome of surgery was acceptable in 45% and unacceptable in 55% of the cases. Breed was the only factor that could be correlated with the outcome. The procedure failed in 86.5% of the cocker spaniels. When surgical outcomes in breeds other than cocker spaniels were evaluated, 63% were acceptable and 37% were unacceptable. Sharpeis were found to have an ear canal of small diameter compared with that of other breeds and a tendency to have better outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aprea, Francesco</author><author>Clark, Louise</author><author>Whitley, Nathaniel T</author><author>Oliveira, Pedro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presumed 'suicidal right ventricle' in a Cocker Spaniel dog undergoing pulmonary  valve balloon dilation and its prevention in an analogous case.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia</full-title></periodical><pages>438-439</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Balloon Valvuloplasty</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Outflow Obstruction</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24576184</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vaa.12134</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sigle, Kelly J</author><author>Nasisse, Mark P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term complications after phacoemulsification for cataract removal in dogs:  172 cases (1995-2002).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>74-79</pages><volume>228</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phacoemulsification</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retinal Detachment</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16426170</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.228.1.74</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine common postoperative complications and risk factors for  development of postoperative glaucoma or failure to preserve vision after phacoemulsification for cataract removal in dogs. Design-Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 172 dogs (290 eyes) that underwent phacoemulsification surgery for cataract removal. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed for postoperative complications; prevalence rates for each complication were calculated for follow-up periods of 3 months, &gt; 3 to 6 months, &gt; 6 months to 1 year, &gt; 1 to 2 years, &gt; 2 to 3 years, &gt; 3 to 4 years, and &gt; 4 years. Odds ratios for breed, age, sex, cataract hypermaturity, lens-induced uveitis, and diabetes mellitus were determined with respect to glaucoma and failure (ie, blindness, enucleation, or evisceration). RESULTS: The most common complication was mild posterior capsule opacification. Retinal detachment was uncommon (1% to 2%) for all time periods. Prevalence of glaucoma increased with time, although it remained &lt; 10% until after the 1-year follow-up period. Boston Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Cocker Spaniel-Poodle crosses, and Shih Tzus had increased risk of developing glaucoma. Eyes with hypermature cataracts were more likely to develop glaucoma. Prevalence of failure increased with time, although it remained &lt; 10% until after the 3-year follow-up period. Cocker Spaniel-Poodle cross and Shih Tzus were more likely to have failure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Evaluation of breed and cataract hypermaturity may aid in the selection of patients. The increasing prevalence of postoperative complications with time indicated that longterm monitoring is warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hagiwara, Y</author><author>Fujiwara, S</author><author>Takai, H</author><author>Ohno, K</author><author>Masuda, K</author><author>Furuta, T</author><author>Nakayama, H</author><author>Doi, K</author><author>Tsujimoto, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>349-351</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dyspnea</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11307943</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1292/jvms.63.349</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was diagnosed by postmortem examination of a  one-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with four-week history of dyspnea.

METHODS: An autosomal recessive form of progressive hereditary nephritis (HN) was studied in 10 affected, 3 obligate carrier, and 4 unaffected English cocker spaniel (ECS) dogs. Clinical, pathological, and ultrastructural features of the disease were characterized. Expression of basement membrane (BM) proteins was examined with an immunohistochemical technique using monospecific antibodies. RESULTS: Affected dogs had proteinuria and juvenile-onset chronic renal failure. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and multilamellation typical of HN were observed in all renal specimens obtained from proteinuric dogs, and severity of GBM ultrastructural abnormalities varied with the clinical stage of disease. Expression of alpha3(IV) and alpha4(IV) chains was totally absent in the kidney of affected dogs. Expression of alpha5(IV) and a6(IV) chains was normal in Bowman's capsule, collecting tubular BM and epidermal BM of affected dogs. The alpha5(IV) chain was not expressed in distal tubular BM of affected dogs. Expression of alpha5(IV) chains was markedly reduced but not absent, and expression of alpha6(IV) chains was present in GBM of affected dogs. Expression of alpha1-alpha2(IV) chains in GBM of affected dogs was increased. Features of obligate carriers were similar to those of unaffected dogs. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HN in ECS dogs is a naturally occurring animal model of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. However, it differs from human disease in the persistence of alpha5(IV) chains in GBM and in the appearance of a6(IV) chains in GBM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Niles, J D</author><author>Williams, J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Perineal hernia with bladder retroflexion in a female cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>92-94</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hernia</keyword><keyword>Herniorrhaphy</keyword><keyword>Perineum</keyword><keyword>Surgery, Veterinary</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Diseases</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10088090</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.1999.tb03045.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Perineal herniation in the bitch is rare and its complication by bladder  retroflexion in the bitch has not been previously reported in the literature.

We have examined the opsin gene for polymorphisms in several breeds of pedigree dog suffering from distinct forms of gPRA, by methods including single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, microsatellite analysis and direct sequencing. The breeds examined included the Tibetan terrier, the miniature schnauzer, the Irish setter, the miniature poodle, the Labrador retriever and the English cocker spaniel, as well as individuals from breeds in which PRA has not been described and of mixed breed. Individuals from each of the named breeds suffering from PRA were compared with clinically normal dogs. Two polymorphisms were found. One, segregating within the Tibetan terrier population, but not seen in other breeds, was a synonymous transition at nucleotide position 780 in exon 3. Inheritance of this polymorphism suggests that opsin is unlikely to contain mutations causative of gPRA in this breed. The other polymorphism occurred between all miniature schnauzers examined and dogs of other breeds. It consisted of a single base insertion in intron 2. No polymorphisms in the opsin sequence were detected in any other breed. DNA sequencing allowed rigorous exclusion of mutations in opsin as a cause of gPRA in miniature poodles, English cocker spaniels or Labrador retrievers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jansen, J H</author><author>Arnesen, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oxalate nephropathy in a Tibetan spaniel litter.

The site at which tumors  occurred and the age and sex of the dogs were similar to those in previous reports. The skin of the digits, chin, ear, and lip represented the most common (17/29) tumor sites. Males and females were equally represented, and tumors occurred in middle-aged to old dogs (mean age, 9.0 years). A breed predilection was seen in the Cocker Spaniel (n = 7; 24%); Cocker Spaniels represented only 4% (210/4,725) of the submissions during the same period. Tumors were stained with immunohistochemical markers (lambda light chain, K light chain) and thioflavine T. Immunoreactivity was limited to either lambda or K light chains, consistent with a monoclonal plasma cell population. The majority of tumors expressed lambda light chains, consistent with previously reported canine plasma cell dyscrasias. Thioflavine T cytoplasmic fluorescence was seen in the majority (18/29) of plasmacytomas and with inflammatory plasma cells present in control specimens. Other round cell neoplasms (lymphosarcoma, histiocytoma, and mastocytoma) were negative with thioflavine T, indicating that positive staining with thioflavine T was specific for plasma cells (neoplastic and inflammatory). This study confirms by immunohistochemistry that canine extramedullary plasmacytomas disproportionately express lambda light chains and establishes thioflavine T staining as a rapid histochemical method for diagnosis of these tumors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gavaghan, B J</author><author>Kittleson, M D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dilated cardiomyopathy in an American cocker spaniel with taurine deficiency.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>862-868</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antihypertensive Agents</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</keyword><keyword>Cardiotonic Agents</keyword><keyword>Digoxin</keyword><keyword>Diuretics</keyword><keyword>Dobutamine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dyspnea</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Enalapril</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Furosemide</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Heart Ventricles</keyword><keyword>Nitroglycerin</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema</keyword><keyword>Taurine</keyword><keyword>Vasodilator Agents</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9469219</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.1997.tb11253.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An American Cocker Spaniel with low plasma taurine concentration (&lt; 2 nmol/mL)  was presented with dyspnoea associated with pulmonary oedema and a left ventricular shortening fraction of 9%. Emergency therapy with furosemide, dobutamine, nitroglycerine and oxygen supplementation led to a good response. Chronic therapy was started with enalapril, furosemide, digoxin and taurine. Improvement in all echocardiographic indices were noted over a 22 week follow-up, most notably an increase in left ventricular shortening fraction to 20%, a decrease of E-point septal separation from 14 mm to 7 mm and marked left ventricular remodelling. This degree of improvement in myocardial function may represent a direct link between dilated cardiomyopathy in the American Cocker Spaniel and plasma taurine deficiency. Alternatively, this response may reflect a breed-related cardiomyopathy with a natural history and therapeutic response not commonly seen in the more common large breed cardiomyopathy presentations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kahler, J S</author><author>Leach, M W</author><author>Jang, S</author><author>Wong, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disseminated aspergillosis attributable to Aspergillus deflectus in a springer  spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>871-874</pages><volume>197</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aspergillosis</keyword><keyword>Aspergillus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lung Diseases, Fungal</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year></dates><accession-num>2228770</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Disseminated aspergillosis attributable to Aspergillus deflectus was diagnosed in  a Springer Spaniel with lethargy, lameness, anorexia, weight loss, pyrexia, lymphadenopathy, hematuria, and urinary incontinence.

Persistent macrocytic hypochromic anemia with marked reticulocytosis and metarubricytosis was found when CBC results were compared with reference values for Whippets. Increased serum creatine kinase activity and hyperkalemia also were sometimes present over the 4-year period of evaluation. Progressively increasing serum concentrations of N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide suggested cardiac disease. Erythrocytes from the whippets were less osmotically fragile but more alkaline fragile than those from control dogs. Erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (PFK) activities and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations were decreased. Restriction enzyme-based DNA test screening and DNA sequencing revealed the same mutation in the muscle-PFK gene of the Whippets as seen in English Springer Spaniel dogs with PFK deficiency. This is the first report of PFK deficiency in Whippet dogs. In addition to causing hemolysis and exertional myopathy, heart disease may be a prominent clinical component of PFK deficiency in this breed and has not been previously recognized in PFK-deficient English Springer Spaniels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cummings, J F</author><author>Wood, P A</author><author>Walkley, S U</author><author>de Lahunta, A</author><author>DeForest, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GM2 gangliosidosis in a Japanese spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Acta neuropathologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta neuropathologica</full-title></periodical><pages>247-253</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>G(M2) Ganglioside</keyword><keyword>Gangliosides</keyword><keyword>Gangliosidoses</keyword><keyword>Golgi Apparatus</keyword><keyword>Hexosaminidases</keyword><keyword>Lysosomes</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year></dates><accession-num>2931941</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00687809</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A storage disease in a 2-year-old Japanese Spaniel resembled a GM2 gangliosidosis  previously identified in a now extinct line of German Shorthaired Pointers.

Of 466 MR studies reviewed, an increased signal was identified in the tympanic bulla in 32 (7%) dogs. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Cocker spaniels, Bulldogs, and Boxers were over-represented compared to the population of dogs having MR imaging. Five (16%) dogs had definite otitis media and one (3%) had a meningioma invading the middle ear. Of the remaining dogs, 13 (41%) had possible otitis media and 13 (41%) had neurologic conditions apparently unrelated to otitis media. The most common appearance of material in the middle ear was isointense in T1-weighted images and hyperintense in T2-weighted images. There was no apparent correlation between the signal characteristics of the material and the diagnosis. Enhanced signal after gadolinium administration was observed affecting the lining of the bulla in dogs with otitis media and in dogs with unrelated neurologic conditions. In dogs without clinical signs of otitis media, finding an increased signal in the middle ear during MR imaging may reflect subclinical otitis media or fluid accumulation unrelated to inflammation. Brachycephalic dogs may be predisposed to this condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mariani, C L</author><author>Shelton, S B</author><author>Alsup, J C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paraneoplastic polyneuropathy and subsequent recovery following tumor removal in  a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>302-305</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoma</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Paraneoplastic Syndromes</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10416774</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-35-4-302</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 10-year-old, intact female Brittany spaniel was presented for evaluation of  progressive tetraparesis.

Retinal dysplasia has been reported in Bedlington Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, Beagle, Labrador Retriever, English Cocker Spaniel, American Cocker Spaniel, English Springer Spaniel, Yorkshire Terrier and Rottweiler. A hereditary basis for retinal dysplasia has been proved or suggested for all breeds exhibiting retinal dysplasia except Beagle and Rottweiler. Ophthalmoscopically retinal dysplasia is characterized by vermiform streaks often radiating from the optic disc. The reflectivity of the tapetum is often altered in these areas. Accompanying retinal detachment or cataractous changes in the lens may be seen. Extensive retinal dysplasia and retinal detachment or cataract may result in visual impairment or blindness. Eyes exhibiting retinal dysplasia may be classified according to the number of layers from the retinal structure that are represented in the rosettes. Three-layer rosette. Two-layer rosette. Single-layer rosette. Primitive unilayer rosette. The etiology of retinal dysplasia includes viral disorders, irradiation, X-radiation, intrauterine trauma and heritable factors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iwabe, Simone</author><author>Moreno-Mendoza, Norma A</author><author>Trigo-Tavera, Francisco</author><author>Crowder, Cheryl</author><author>García-Sánchez, Gustavo A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrograde axonal transport obstruction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor  (BDNF) and its TrkB receptor in the retina and optic nerve of American Cocker Spaniel dogs with spontaneous glaucoma.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>12-19</pages><volume>10 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Axonal Transport</keyword><keyword>Axons</keyword><keyword>Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Optic Nerve</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Receptor, trkB</keyword><keyword>Retinal Ganglion Cells</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17973830</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00504.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree of retrograde optic nerve axonal transport  obstruction at the scleral lamina cribosa level by examining levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor type B (TrkB) in dogs presenting with high intraocular pressure. ANIMALS STUDIED: A total of 10 eyes, four normal and six glaucomatous eyes, from normal and affected American Cocker Spaniels with primary glaucoma were studied. All eyes were assessed by neuro-ophthalmic examination, tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy prior to enucleation. METHODS: Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed to evaluate BDNF and TrkB receptor expression in retina and optic nerve in normal and glaucomatous dogs. RESULTS: In all normal eyes BDNF immunostaining was detected in the cytoplasm of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), nerve fiber layer (NFL), optic nerve head cells, and lamina cribosa cells. In all glaucomatous eyes BDNF was more evident in RGC, NFL and lamina cribosa cells. TrkB receptor was detected in the cytoplasm of RGC, NFL and ONH bundles in all normal eyes, and in a more intense pattern in all glaucomatous eyes. CONCLUSIONS: BDNF retrograde axonal transport is substantially inhibited by intraocular pressure elevation. TrkB accumulation at the ONH in glaucoma suggests a role for neurotrophin deprivation in the pathogenesis of RGC death in canine glaucoma, as well as a possible paracrine and/or autocrine signaling within the lamina cribosa. Neurotrophin signaling may regulate more than neuronal development, survival and differentiation. BDNF neurotrophin and its TrkB receptor expression by lamina cribosa cells and ONH astrocytes in glaucomatous eyes may help to determine the role of these cells as a paracrine source in terms of retinal ganglion cell survival, during episodes of elevated intraocular pressure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hill, B L</author><author>Zenoble, R D</author><author>Dodds, W J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prothrombin deficiency in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>262-263</pages><volume>181</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gingival Hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypoprothrombinemias</keyword><keyword>Oral Hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>6980872</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Sybille A</author><author>Hohenhaus, Ann E</author><author>Hale, Anne S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Case-control study of blood type, breed, sex, and bacteremia in dogs with  immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>232-235</pages><volume>224</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacteremia</keyword><keyword>Blood Grouping and Crossmatching</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>14736067</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2004.224.232</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether blood type, breed, or sex were risk factors for  immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in dogs and whether bacteremia was common in dogs with IMHA. DESIGN: Case-control study. ANIMALS: 33 dogs with IMHA, 1,014 dogs without IMHA for which blood type (dog erythrocyte antigens 1.1, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) was known, 15,668 dogs without IMHA for which breed was known, and 15,589 dogs without IMHA for which sex was known. PROCEDURE: Blood type, breed, and sex distribution of dogs with IMHA were compared with data for control dogs with Fisher exact tests and by calculating odds ratios (ORs). Results of bacterial culture of blood samples were documented for dogs with IMHA, when available. RESULTS: Dog erythrocyte antigen 7 was associated with a significant protective effect (OR, 0.1) in Cocker Spaniels with IMHA (n = 10), compared with control dogs. Cocker Spaniels, Bichon Frise, Miniature Pinschers, Rough-coated Collies, and Finnish Spitz had a significantly increased risk of IMHA, as did female dogs (OR, 2.1). Blood samples from 12 dogs with IMHA were submitted for bacterial culture, and none had bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that blood type, breed, and sex may play a role in IMHA in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lamb, C R</author><author>Wikeley, H</author><author>Boswood, A</author><author>Pfeiffer, D U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of breed-specific ranges for the vertebral heart scale as an aid to the  radiographic diagnosis of cardiac disease in dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>707-711</pages><volume>148</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Heart Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11430680</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.148.23.707</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The vertebral heart scale was measured on right lateral recumbent thoracic  radiographs of 320 dogs of six popular breeds, including for each breed at least 20 dogs with no clinical signs of cardiovascular or respiratory disease and at least 19 dogs with cardiac or respiratory disease. There were significant differences between the mean values of the scale for the different breeds; the normal boxer dogs had a significantly higher mean value than the normal dogs of all the other breeds, and the labrador retrievers had a significantly higher mean value than all the other breeds except the boxer and the cavalier King Charles spaniel. For all the breeds except the boxer, there was a trend for dogs with cardiac disease (but not respiratory disease) to have higher mean values on the scale than normal dogs of the same breed; however, at the optimal value of the scale for distinguishing between dogs of each breed with and without cardiac disease, the sensitivity and specificity were relatively low, in the range 58 to 83 per cent. The scale was most accurate for the diagnosis of cardiac disease in the Yorkshire terrier and the cavalier King Charles spaniel, breeds affected by predominantly dilative forms of cardiac disease. In contrast, it was very inaccurate in the boxer, a breed that has a higher incidence of cardiac diseases associated with concentric hypertrophy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parchman, M B</author><author>Crameri, F M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary vertebral hemangiosarcoma in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>79-81</pages><volume>194</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ataxia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hemangiosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Myelography</keyword><keyword>Paraplegia</keyword><keyword>Spinal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1989</year></dates><accession-num>2914798</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7-year-old spayed Cocker Spaniel was evaluated for recurrent hind limb  paraplegia.

The dog had a history of chronic weight loss, diarrhoea, mild anaemia, hypoproteinemia and reduced jejunal absorption of D-xylose. A diagnosis of fucosidosis with intestinal malabsorption was based on these findings, markedly reduced plasma fucosidase levels and the diffuse infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosa of the stomach, small intestine, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes by macrophages with finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic vacuolation was also a feature of cells of the pancreas, thryroid, parathyroid and adenohypophysis and the epithelia lining respiratory airways and the urogenital tract. Neurons of the autonomic plexuses of the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary bladder as well as those of the brain, spinal cord, spinal ganglia and retina were also vacuolated. The profound decrease in sigma-fucosidase activity in the brain, liver and kidney was accompanied by a marked increase in 6 other lysosomal enzymes, especially beta-n-acetyl glucosaminidase.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nimmo Wilkie, J S</author><author>Hudson, E B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neuronal and generalized ceroid-lipofuscinosis in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>623-628</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscle, Smooth</keyword><keyword>Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>6890736</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/030098588201900605</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Knowler, Penny</author><author>Rouleau, Guy A</author><author>Minassian, Berge A</author><author>Rothuizen, Jan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inherited occipital hypoplasia/syringomyelia in the cavalier King Charles  spaniel: experiences in setting up a worldwide DNA collection.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>745-749</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Databases, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Databases, Nucleic Acid</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Patient Selection</keyword><keyword>Scoliosis</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15958797</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/esi074</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Inherited diseases commonly emerge within pedigree dog populations, often due to  use of repeatedly bred carrier sire(s) within a small gene pool. Accurate family records are usually available making linkage analysis possible. However, there are many factors that are intrinsically difficult about collecting DNA and collating pedigree information from a large canine population. The keys to a successful DNA collection program include (1) the need to establish and maintain support from the pedigree breed clubs and pet owners; (2) committed individual(s) who can devote the considerable amount of time and energy to coordinating sample collection and communicating with breeders and clubs; and (3) providing means by which genotypic and phenotypic information can be easily collected and stored. In this article we described the clinical characteristics of inherited occipital hypoplasia/syringomyelia (Chiari type I malformation) in the cavalier King Charles spaniel and our experiences in establishing a pedigree and DNA database to study the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bjerkås, Ellen</author><author>Ekesten, Björn</author><author>Farstad, Wenche</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pectinate ligament dysplasia and narrowing of the iridocorneal angle associated  with glaucoma in the English Springer Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>49-54</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cornea</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Angle-Closure</keyword><keyword>Gonioscopy</keyword><keyword>Iris</keyword><keyword>Ligaments</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Tonometry, Ocular</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11940248</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1463-5224.2002.00213.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate if tonometry and gonioscopy could  serve as predictors of later glaucoma development in the English Springer Spaniel, a breed prone to developing primary glaucoma. ANIMALS STUDIED: Gonioscopy was performed on 279 English Springer Spaniel dogs, 119 males and 160 females, with clinically normal eyes. In addition, 14 dogs, five males and nine females were examined for glaucoma. RESULTS: A positive relation between pectinate ligament dysplasia (PLD) and narrowing of the relative width of the ciliary cleft (RWOCC) and also between PLD, RWOCC and age was demonstrated. The prevalence of PLD was 25.5%, which is higher than in other breeds reported. A positive association was demonstrated between PLD and glaucoma, as well as between narrowing of the RWOCC and glaucoma. Glaucoma was not observed in dogs with normal appearance of the iridocorneal angle. English Springer Spaniels related to dogs with glaucoma show more narrowing of the RWOCC and more PLD than unrelated dogs. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the positive association between PLD and glaucoma, between narrowing of the iridocorneal angle and glaucoma and the effect of age on the iridocorneal angle. Mating of dogs with normal iridocorneal angles appears to reduce the presence and degree of abnormal appearance of the iridocorneal angle in the offspring. However, breeding only dogs with normal iridocorneal angles without consideration of their relationship to dogs with glaucoma is not a guarantee for preventing glaucoma in the offspring.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Griffiths, I R</author><author>Duncan, I D</author><author>McCulloch, M</author><author>Harvey, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shaking pups: a disorder of central myelination in the Spaniel dog.

The affected animals were much reduced in weight an size and showed gross generalised tremor, particularly when aroused, at about 10-12 days of age. Affected pups were studied between 1 and 3 months of age. There was severe hypomyelination throughout the CNS which was more marked in the cerebrum and optic nerves than in the spinal cord. The amount of myelin at each location increased with age. Axonal calibre also increased and there was no difference between the axonal diameters of affected and age-matched normal pups. Axons were either naked or surrounded by a disproportionately thin layer of myelin. Myelinated internodes tended to be short and heminodes were frequent. Vacuoles were present adjacent to axons or within glia but there was no evidence of demyelination. Total glial numbers were not reduced and numerous oligodendroglial and astrocytic nuclei identified. Peripheral, cranial and autonomic nerves were myelinated normally. It is suggested that there is an abnormality of oligodendroglial metabolism such that they cannot form and maintain normal myelin. Consequently the radial and longitudinal extensions of their plasma membranes are reduced. The vacuoles may represent a breakdown of defective myelin lipids as suggested in certain murine mutants. This defect of myelination provides a further model in which normal and disordered myelinogenesis can be studied.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Hansson, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heart sounds and murmurs: changes related to severity of chronic valvular disease  in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>75-85</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Heart Sounds</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>7760313</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.1995.tb03276.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Auscultatory, phonocardiographic (PCG), radiographic, and echocardiographic  evidence of chronic valvular disease (CVD) were studied in 79 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with a mean age of 7.6 years (SD 2.6). Cardiac murmurs were present in 59 of the dogs and the intensity of the systolic cardiac murmur, assessed by auscultation (grade 1-6), was correlated (P &lt; .001) to the severity of CVD (heart failure class) and to the echocardiographic dimensions of the heart (left atrial ratio, La/Ao-d, and left ventricular end diastolic diameter, LVEDD) (both P &lt; .001). The heart sounds and duration of electromechanical systole (Q-S2) were investigated in all dogs using measurements obtained from PCG recordings. Normal regression equations describing the relation between heart rate and systolic intervals (Q-S1, Q-S2 and S1-S2) were established based on observations in 11 normal control Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. The total electromechanical systole (Q-S2), Q-S1, and S1-S2 intervals in the 59 dogs were related to the corresponding normal regression equation. A shortening of Q-S2 and S1-S2 intervals were found in dogs belonging to heart failure class I (Q-S2; P &lt; .01 and S1-S2; P &lt; .05), class II, and classes III and IV (both P &lt; .001). The ratio of the amplitudes of the first (S1) and second heart sounds (S2) measured on the PCG recordings was found to be increased in dogs belonging to class I (P &lt; .01), class II, and classes III and IV (both P &lt; .001). The relationship between cardiac dimensions (LVEDD and La/Ao-d) and S1a/S2a ratio was described by quadratic regression and found to be significant for both parameters (LVEDD; P &lt; .001, R2 = .54 and La/Ao-d; P &lt; .001, R2 = .63). The presence of a third heart sound (S3) was detected, using PCG, in 21 of the 68 dogs. The proportion of dogs exhibiting S3 increased with heart failure class (and increasing cardiac dimensions) (P &lt; .001). These findings were confirmed by observations in 13 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with cardiac failure progressing from heart failure class I to class II (Mean LVEDD from 30.2 to 35.2 mm and mean La/Ao-d from 1.09 to 1.43). An increase in intensity of the heart murmur, assessed by auscultation, increase in the ratio of the amplitudes of S1 and S2, as well as a shortening in Q-S2 and S1-S2 intervals (all P &lt; .01) were found in these dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corfield, G S</author><author>Burrows, A K</author><author>Imani, P</author><author>Bryden, S L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The method of application and short term results of tympanostomy tubes for the  treatment of primary secretory otitis media in three Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>88-94</pages><volume>86</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Middle Ear Ventilation</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Tympanic Membrane</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18304044</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2008.00254.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Primary secretory otitis media is an uncommon disease affecting predominantly  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs. Current treatment recommendations include repeated manual removal of the mucoid effusion from the tympanic cavity through a myringotomy incision and topical or systemic corticosteroids. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of tympanostomy tubes to provide continual tympanic cavity ventilation and drainage for the treatment of primary secretory otitis media in three dogs. Tympanostomy tubes were placed within a myringotomy incision in the pars tensa with the aid of an operating microscope. Clinical signs resolved rapidly in all cases following the procedure and all cases were asymptomatic at the time of follow-up, 8, 6 and 4 months later. Results of this study indicate that tympanostomy tubes provide continual tympanic cavity ventilation and drainage and may be an acceptable alternative to repeated myringotomy for the treatment of primary secretory otitis media.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hamor, R E</author><author>Roberts, S M</author><author>Severin, G A</author><author>Chavkin, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of results for Schirmer tear tests conducted with and without  application of a topical anesthetic in clinically normal dogs of 5 breeds.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1422-1425</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Administration, Topical</keyword><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Anesthesia, Local</keyword><keyword>Anesthetics, Local</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Circadian Rhythm</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Propoxycaine</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Tears</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11108191</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.2000.61.1422</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, for clinically normal dogs, results of Schirmer tear  tests in eyes without topical anesthetic (STT) and to detect differences associated with breed, sex, age, day, and time of day in eyes in which STT was performed after use of topical anesthetic (STTa). ANIMALS: 41 Beagles, 43 Labrador Retrievers, 25 Golden Retrievers, 26 English Springer Spaniels, and 22 Shetland Sheepdogs. PROCEDURE: Beagles had STT and STTa values measured twice daily for 5 days. Client-owned dogs of 4 other breeds had STT and STTa values measured once. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD values of Beagles for STT and STTa were 20.2 +/- 2.5 and 3.8 +/- 2.7 mm/min. Mean values for STT and STTa were as follows: Labrador Retriever, 22.9 +/- 4.1 and 9.6 +/- 3.8 mm/min; English Springer Spaniel; 20.7 +/- 3.2 and 5.4 +/- 3.4 mm/min; Golden Retriever, 21.8 + 3.7 and 8.8 +/- 3.1 mm/min; and Shetland Sheepdog, 15.8 +/- 1.8 and 3.6 +/- 2.8 mm/min. Overall mean values for STT and STTa were 20.2 +/- 3.0 and 6.2 +/- 3.1 mm/min. Differences for STT and STTa were detected among breeds, but significant differences were not associated with sex or age within each breed or in overall values for all dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results for the STT reported here compare favorably with reported values, except for results of Shetland Sheepdogs; however, results for the STTa differ dramatically from reported values. Clinicians should consider effects attributable to breed when evaluating results of STT and STTa in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pryor, Patricia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Animal behavior case of the month.

Although canine erythrocytes are in general known to be more alkaline fragile, erythrocytes from both patients began to lyse earlier, at significantly lower pH values (near pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C), than erythrocytes from control dogs. Hyperventilation induced by 30 minutes of exercise, placement in a 39 degrees C water bath, or intravenous doxapram increased venous blood pH in dog 1 and control dogs, but transient hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and severe bilirubinuria occurred only in the studied patient. The erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity was severely decreased in both dogs (10% of controls). The erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate content was markedly reduced and the cell chloride content was consequently increased. This change in cell chloride content is related to an increase in the erythrocyte pH, which may partially explain the pathogenesis of hemolysis in canine PFK deficiency. Thus, these studies demonstrate a presumably inherited erythrocyte PFK deficiency in English springer spaniels, which causes an increased in vitro and in vivo erythrocyte alkaline fragility. Dogs with PFK deficiency and inducible hemolytic crises may become a valuable genetic animal model in which to study the pathophysiology of hemolysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Braund, K G</author><author>Simpson, S T</author><author>Steiss, J E</author><author>Cox, N R</author><author>Baker, H J</author><author>Smith, B F</author><author>Klopp, L S</author><author>Knecht, C D</author><author>Sorjonen, D C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Idiopathic neuromyopathy in a young American cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>370</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Neuromuscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8531186</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.1995.tb01102.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, G M</author><author>Ellersieck, M R</author><author>Wheeler, C A</author><author>Blanchard, G L</author><author>Keller, W F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inheritance of retinal dysplasia in the English Spring Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1089-1090</pages><volume>174</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retinal Diseases</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year></dates><accession-num>438039</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, H-M</author><author>Hwang, D-N</author><author>Kang, B-T</author><author>Jung, D-I</author><author>Song, G-S</author><author>Lee, S-J</author><author>Yhee, J-Y</author><author>Yu, C-H</author><author>Doster, A R</author><author>Sur, J-H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis in a dog: evidence of immunophenotypic  diversity and relationship to human pulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis and pulmonary Hodgkin's disease.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>921-923</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hodgkin Disease</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung Diseases</keyword><keyword>Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>18039906</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1354/vp.44-6-921</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We describe a 10-month-old, intact female American Cocker Spaniel with pulmonary  lymphomatoid granulomatosis (PLG). On clinical examination, this dog presented with nonproductive dry cough, serous nasal discharge, dyspnea, and lack of appetite. Radiography showed a consolidated lesion in the left cranial lung lobe. Histopathologic examination showed a mixed population of atypical lymphoid cells that had infiltrated into the pulmonary blood vessels angiocentrically. The lymphocytes were CD3 positive, consistent with a pan-T-cell phenotype. The lymphoid cells in the lesion were also positive for CD20cy and CD79a, indicative of the presence of B cells. We also observed large Reed-Sternberg-like cells that were positive for CD15 and CD30, similar to observations in human pulmonary Hodgkin's disease (PHD).

This dog had a massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain. The beta-hexosaminidase activity in this affected dog brain was approximately 12 times higher than that of normal brain. However, the activity toward p-nitrophenyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranoside was only four times higher in the affected brain than in normal brain. The GM2 activator preparation obtained from the normal dog brain could stimulate the hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside by beta-hexosaminidase isolated from the affected dog. However, the corresponding activator fraction from the affected dog could not stimulate such a reaction. It was concluded that the biochemical basis of the GM2 gangliosidosis in this Japanese Spaniel was due to the attenuation in the stimulatory activity of GM2 activator. This case represents the first animal form similar to the activator deficiency (or defect) of Type AB GM2 gangliosidosis in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dain, A R</author><author>Walker, R G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two intersex dogs with mosaicism.</title><secondary-title>Journal of reproduction and fertility</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of reproduction and fertility</full-title></periodical><pages>239-242</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Karyotyping</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mosaicism</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year></dates><accession-num>469848</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1530/jrf.0.0560239</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Two intersex dogs with various degrees of mosaicism in the somatic tissues are  described.

The paper proposes a problem-oriented, rather than technique-oriented, approach to family therapy. Most therapy can be performed in a calm, polite, rational, straightforward manner without any tricks or therapeutic razzle-dazzle. From time to time, the therapist may have to startle or jerk the family past a snag point and into change. Ideally, the therapist's techniques should arise from the content of the hour and the symbolism of the family and should be applied sparingly.

At the time of diagnosis they were between three and seven years old; however, early ophthalmoscopic changes caused by the thinning of the retina could sometimes be difficult to observe because of the partial or total lack of the tapetum in many of the dogs. The disease developed rapidly, approximately one year passing from the initial clinical signs of night blindness to complete loss of vision. Twenty-four male and 27 female dogs were affected. All the affected dogs were interrelated and could be traced back to common English ancestors. On the basis of pedigree studies, an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is postulated. Information on 15 diagnosed cases of the condition in other countries shows that the disease may be considered a worldwide problem in the Tibetan spaniel.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>STRANDE, A</author><author>SOMMERS, S C</author><author>PETRAK, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regional enterocolitis in cocker spaniel dogs.</title><secondary-title>A.M.A. archives of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>A.M.A. archives of pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>357-362</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enterocolitis</keyword><keyword>Ileitis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1954</year></dates><accession-num>13147647</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Remnant, C T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suspected poisoning in a working spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>606</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Poisoning</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6523699</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.115.23.606-a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bellah, J R</author><author>Spencer, C P</author><author>Brown, D J</author><author>Whitton, D L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital cranioventral abdominal wall, caudal sternal, diaphragmatic,  pericardial, and intracardiac defects in cocker spaniel littermates.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1741-1746</pages><volume>194</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Abdominal Muscles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomegaly</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</keyword><keyword>Hernia, Diaphragmatic</keyword><keyword>Hernia, Ventral</keyword><keyword>Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Pericardium</keyword><keyword>Sternum</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1989</year></dates><accession-num>2526803</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Five littermate Cocker Spaniels were born with concomitant pericardial,  diaphragmatic, caudal sternal, and cranioventral abdominal wall defects.

Chemotaxis and random migration in affected and heterozygous dogs were found to be comparable to those of control dogs. Increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) neutrophil adhesion, antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, iodination of proteins, and oxygen radical production in neutrophils from affected dogs were probably the result of chronic bacterial infection in vivo. Bacterial ingestion by neutrophils from the three heterozygous English Springer Spaniel dogs was significantly increased compared to control dogs but was not different from affected English Springer Spaniel dogs, suggesting a breed-related phenomenon. Significant decreases in neutrophil function were not seen in any of the dogs with congenital ciliary dyskinesia, indicating that a defective microtubular system is not shared by respiratory cilia and neutrophils and that defective neutrophil function does not contribute to respiratory infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whiteley, H E</author><author>Young, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The external limiting membrane in developing normal and dysplastic canine retina.</title><secondary-title>Tissue &amp; cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tissue &amp; cell</full-title></periodical><pages>231-239</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fetus</keyword><keyword>Freeze Fracturing</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Retina</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>embryology</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3705056</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0040-8166(86)90031-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Development of the external limiting membrane of the retina in English springer  spaniel fetuses and neonates with incipient stages of retinal dysplasia and in normal mongrel fetuses and neonates was examined using transmission electron microscopy and the freeze-fracture technique. The external limiting membrane of the retina of normal canine fetuses was composed of zonulae adherentes in which there were focal areas of apparent apposition between adjacent ventricular cell membranes. Freeze-fracture examination revealed gap junctions within the external limiting membrane that were composed of 8-10 nm P-face particles in aggregates of variable size and shape. These junctions corresponded to areas of focal membrane apposition. Tight junction strands were also identified in deep E-face grooves which were located perpendicular to the external limiting membrane. At day 46 of gestation in incipiently dysplastic English springer spaniel fetal eyes, there was a marked decrease in the size and area occupied by gap junctions within the external limiting membrane as compared with retinas of mongrel control fetuses at the same age and of other age groups. This apparent loss of gap junctions, coincident with the incipient onset of histologically detectable dysplastic events in the sensory retina, may contribute to the morphogenesis of the defect.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giger, U</author><author>Smith, B F</author><author>Woods, C B</author><author>Patterson, D F</author><author>Stedman, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inherited phosphofructokinase deficiency in an American cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1569-1571</pages><volume>201</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Erythrocytes</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Muscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinase-1</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1289336</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-year-old female American Cocker Spaniel with a chronic hemolytic disorder and  hemolytic crises was found to have M-type phosphofructokinase deficiency.

There was a significant difference in the distribution of breeds (juvenile P &lt; 0.002, adult P &lt; 0.001; chi squared) presented for demodicosis compared with the distribution of the same breeds presented to our practice during the same time period. Cocker Spaniels and mixed-breed dogs were likely to be under-represented in both the adult- and juvenile-onset groups. Significantly more miticidal treatments were required to achieve clinical remission in adult dogs with pustular demodicosis compared with juvenile dogs with pustular disease (P &lt; 0.05; Kruskall-Wallis). Concurrent disease and associated drug administration were assessed for adult dogs with demodicosis. Of dogs with concurrent conditions (n=15), administration of corticosteroids and endogenous hyperadrenocorticism were recognized most often (10/15). Concurrent neoplastic, infectious, parasitic or metabolic disease was uncommon in dogs with adult-onset demodicosis. Résumé- Les dossiers médicaux de 81 chiens présentant des démodécies généralisées (47 formes juvéniles, 34 formes adultes) ont été analysés. Il existait une différence significative (forme juvénile P &lt; 0.002, forme adulte P &lt; 0.001) dans la distribution des races présentées pour démodécie par rapport aux mêmes races présentées à notre consultation à la même époque. Les cockers spaniels et les chiens métissés sont sous - représentés dans les deux groupes. Le nombre de traitements acaricides nécessaires pour obtenir une rémission clinique était significativement plus élevé chez les chiens adultes présentant une démodécie pustulcuse que chez les jeunes (P &lt; 0.05; Kruskall-Wallis). La présence de pathologies intercurrentes ou iatrogènes a été recherchée chez les chiens adultes. Chez les chiens présentant une pathologie intercurrente (n=15), les diagnostics les plus fréquents (10/15), étaient l'administration de corticoïdes ou un hypercorticisme endogène. Une pathologie intercurrente de type néoplasique, infectieuse, parasitaire ou métabolique est rarement associée à la forme adulte de démodécie canine. [Lemarié, S.L., Hosgood G., Foil C.S.

Los Cocker Spaniel y los cruzados tenían menos posibilidades de presentarse tanto en el grupo de perros jóvenes como en el de adultos. Se necesitaron tratamientos significativamente más miticidas para consequir curación clínica en los perros adultos con demodicosis pustular comparado con los perros jóvenes con presentación pustular (P &lt; 0.05; Kruskall-Wallis). Se detectaron con mayor frecuencia enfermedades concomitantes (n = 15), administración de corticosteroides e hiperadrenocorticismo endógeno (10/15).

Bestehende Krankheit und die damit verbundene Arzneimittelanwendung wurden bei adulten Hunden mit Demodikose ausgewertet. Bei Hunden mit bestehenden Krankheitsbildern (n = 15) wurde am häufigsten die Verabreichung von Kortikosteroiden und endogener Hyperadrenokortizismus festgestellt (10/15). Gleichzeitige neoplastische, infektiöse, parasitäre oder stoffwechselbedingte Erkrankung war bei Hunden mit adult-beginnender Demodikose selten. [Lemarié, S.L., Hosgood G., Foil C.S.

The largest study comprised 14401 histologically verified tumour cases from four counties covered by the Norwegian Canine Cancer Register. The registry covers about 25% of the total Norwegian dog population. The second study was a census in Norway that was sent to all owners of the following breeds: boxers, bichon frisé and Bernese mountain dogs, to estimate the age distribution of the female dog population at risk of developing mammary tumours. The crude incidence of malignant mammary tumours in female dogs of any breed was 53.3%. The highest relative risk ratio of mammary tumours was found in boxers, cocker spaniels, English springer spaniels and dachshunds. The mean age of histologically diagnosed mammary tumours was 7.9 years in boxers and 7.8 years in springer spaniels, compared with 8.8 years in all other breeds. In the four Norwegian counties from 1992 to 1997, the population-based incidence rates (for all ages) of malignant mammary tumours per 1000 female dogs per year were 35.47 in boxers, 3.87 in Bernese mountain dogs and 17.69 in bichon frisé. Mammary cancer is the most common tumour in female dogs in Norway, and represents a population of almost entirely reproductively intact females. The age-specific incidence rates for mammary cancer vary considerably among the three breeds that were studied in detail.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rand, J S</author><author>O'Brien, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exercise-induced malignant hyperthermia in an English springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1013-1014</pages><volume>190</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fever</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscles</keyword><keyword>Physical Exertion</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>3570952</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An exercise-induced malignant hyperthermia-like syndrome developed in an English  Springer Spaniel.

However, little is known about pulmonary blood volume (PBV), blood pulmonary transit time (PTT), and the regulation of these. OBJECTIVES: To measure and evaluate the relationships of PBV, forward stroke volume (FSV), and heart rate normalized blood pulmonary transit time (nPTT) in healthy dogs and dogs with MR. ANIMALS: Thirty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; 11 healthy, 4 in modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 11 in class II, and 7 in CHF. METHODS: Heart rate normalized PTTs were measured by radionuclide angiocardiography. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic diameter, left atrial/aortic root ratio, and FSV were measured by echocardiography. PBV and pulmonary blood volume index (PBVI) were calculated by established formulas. RESULTS: PBVI was 308±56 (mean±SD) mL/m2 for healthy dogs, 287±51 mL/m2 in NYHA class I, 360±66 mL/m2 in Class II, and 623±232 mL/m2 in CHF (P=.0008). Heart rate normalized PTT, not FSV, was a predictor of PBV (r=0.92 and 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Increased PBV, not decreased FSV, is the main cause of increased nPTT in MR. Increased nPTT can be used as an indicator of abnormal cardiopulmonary function in dogs with MR.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, M K</author><author>Lamb, W A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Idiopathic thrombocytopenia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>700-703</pages><volume>83</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoanalysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes, Recessive</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>New South Wales</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic</keyword><keyword>Seroepidemiologic Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16315671</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2005.tb13055.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic idiopathic  macrothrombocytopenia in the population of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) in New South Wales (NSW) and to determine if it exhibits an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. We also aimed to determine if significant differences existed when counting platelets manually, by auto analyser or by blood smear estimation in CKCS and mixed breed dogs. METHODS: Blood was collected from 172 dogs (152 CKCS and 20 mixed breed) and placed into sodium-citrate anticoagulant. Platelet counts were performed manually, by auto analyser and by blood smear estimates in CKCS and mixed breed dogs. Blood smears were also examined for platelet clumping and erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet morphology. Pedigree analysis was performed to determine if an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern was supported. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in platelet counts between CKCS and mixed breed dogs (P &lt; 0.0001). CKCS had a platelet count that was 32% that of the controls (95% confidence interval, 28 to 37%). There was no significant difference between methods used to count platelets. Thirty percent of CKCS had macrothrombocytes. Pedigree analysis and examination of obtained and expected segregation ratios from 17 CKCS families supported an autosomal recessive pattern of Mendelian inheritance. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of idiopathic macrothrombocytopenia exists in CKCS in NSW and automated or blood smear estimates are sufficient to count platelet numbers. Data supports an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawkins, Eleanor C</author><author>Basseches, Jessica</author><author>Berry, Clifford R</author><author>Stebbins, Martha E</author><author>Ferris, Kelly K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Demographic, clinical, and radiographic features of bronchiectasis in dogs: 316  cases (1988-2000).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1628-1635</pages><volume>223</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Bronchiectasis</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual</keyword><keyword>Demography</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>North Carolina</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>14664451</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.2003.223.1628</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine demographic, clinical, and radiographic features of  bronchiectasis in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 289 dogs identified through the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB) and 27 dogs examined at the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. PROCEDURE: Demographic characteristics of dogs identified through the VMDB were compared with characteristics of the entire population of dogs entered in the VMDB. Medical records of dogs examined at the teaching hospital were reviewed; the diagnosis was confirmed through review of thoracic radiographs. RESULTS: Analysis of data from the VMDB indicated that American Cocker Spaniels, West Highland White Terriers, Miniature Poodles, Siberian Huskies, English Springer Spaniels, and dogs &gt; 10 years old had an increased risk of bronchiectasis. Among dogs examined at the teaching hospital, coughing was the most common clinical sign. There was evidence for excessive airway mucus but not hemorrhage. A variety of bacterial organisms were isolated from tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. On thoracic radiographs, cylindrical bronchiectasis, generalized disease, and right cranial lung lobe involvement were most common. Seven of 14 dogs for which follow-up radiographs were available did not have any progression of radiographic lesions. Median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis of bronchiectasis was 9 months (range, 1 day to 10 years). Median survival time was 16 months (range, 2 days to 72 months). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that despite substantial clinical abnormalities, dogs with bronchiectasis may survive for years. Certain purebred dogs and older dogs may have an increased risk of developing bronchiectasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsai, G</author><author>Cork, L C</author><author>Slusher, B S</author><author>Price, D</author><author>Coyle, J T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Abnormal acidic amino acids and N-acetylaspartylglutamate in hereditary canine  motoneuron disease.</title><secondary-title>Brain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain research</full-title></periodical><pages>305-309</pages><volume>629</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acids</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Brain Chemistry</keyword><keyword>Dipeptides</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy, Spinal</keyword><keyword>Neuropeptides</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>cerebrospinal fluid</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><accession-num>8111634</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0006-8993(93)91335-p</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA) is a lower motor neuron disease  found in Brittany Spaniels that shares clinical and pathological features with human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Since acidic excitatory amino acids and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) are reduced in spinal cord and cerebral cortex in ALS, the levels of these substances were measured in nervous tissue in Brittany Spaniels heterozygous and homozygous for HCSMA. Significant reductions in the levels of endogenous aspartate, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and NAAG were found in the spinal cord in homozygous but not heterozygous HCSMA. In contrast, the activity of N-acetylated-alpha-linked-amino dipeptidase (NAALADase), an enzyme that cleaves NAAG into NAA and Glu, was significantly increased. None of these parameters was affected in the motor cortex or occipital cortex. Since NAA and NAAG are highly concentrated in motoneurons, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giger, U</author><author>Harvey, J W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hemolysis caused by phosphofructokinase deficiency in English springer spaniels:  seven cases (1983-1986).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>453-459</pages><volume>191</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Erythrocytes</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinase-1</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>2958437</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Seven English Springer Spaniels (6 adult males and 1 female) with chronic  hemolysis and sporadic intravascular hemolytic crises were determined to have a deficiency in erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity, a key regulatory enzyme of anaerobic glycolysis. Intermittent severe pigmenturia concomitant with weakness, lethargy, and anorexia were the major clinical signs and commonly were related to exercise or other stressful situations that caused panting or barking (hyperventilation). Pale or icteric mucous membranes, fever, mild hepatosplenomegaly, and muscle wasting sometimes were evident. Results of routine laboratory testing indicated a persistent marked bilirubinuria and reticulocytosis with normal PCV, to severe anemia and intermittent hemoglobinuria and hyperkalemia. Erythrocyte PFK activities were severely reduced to 8% to 22% of values for control dogs. The block of glycolysis at the PFK step caused a markedly diminished erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate content, resulting in an increased hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and compensatory accelerated erythrocyte production. Phosphofructokinase-deficient erythrocytes had increased alkaline fragility in vitro and in vivo. Hemolytic crises were induced in vivo by hyperventilation that caused transient, mild alkalemia. Studies of family members of a PFK-deficient dog suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Carrier dogs with half-normal erythrocyte PFK activities appeared clinically normal.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bende, Balázs</author><author>Kovács, Krisztina Borbála</author><author>Solymosi, Norbert</author><author>Németh, Tibor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of urolithiasis in the dog population of Hungary from 2001 to  2012.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</full-title></periodical><pages>323-336</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26551422</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1556/004.2015.030</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of canine  urolithiasis in Hungary in order to determine the annual incidence of urolithiasis and to identify breeds at risk for different types of urolithiasis. Data of a total of 2,543 canine uroliths analysed in the laboratory of the Budapest Urolith Centre were evaluated retrospectively from 2001 to 2012. Logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios for the proportion of each affected breed compared to those of crossbreeds. The annual incidence of urolithiasis was evaluated by the number of submissions compared to the estimated number of dogs in the population from which the samples originated. Epidemiologic data revealed a relatively high and increasing proportion of struvite urolithiasis. Statistical analysis of breed predispositions resulted in the detection of breeds not having been reported at risk (e.g. Bernese Mountain dog - struvite, Bichon Frise, Bolognese, Tibetan Terrier - purine, French Bulldog - cystine). Conflicting results were revealed for some other breeds previously described as being affected by certain types of urolithiasis (Chihuahua, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, English Cocker Spaniel). Regardless of the type of urolithiasis, its average cumulative incidence in the dog population of Hungary was found to be 1.76/10,000/year.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Radulescu, Sinziana Maria</author><author>Humm, Karen</author><author>Eramanis, Louis Mark</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author><author>Church, David B</author><author>Brodbelt, David</author><author>O'Neill, Dan Gerard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vestibular disease in dogs under UK primary veterinary care: Epidemiology and  clinical management.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1993-2004</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Vestibular Diseases</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32776616</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15869</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Vestibular disease (VD), central or peripheral, can be a dramatic  primary-care presentation. Current literature describes mostly dogs examined in referral centers. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Describe the prevalence, presentation, clinical management, and outcomes of VD in dogs under primary veterinary care at UK practices participating in VetCompass. ANIMALS: Seven hundred and fifty-nine vestibular cases identified out of 905 544 study dogs. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Potential VD cases clinically examined during 2016 were verified by reviewing clinical records for signalment, presenting clinical signs, treatments, and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with VD. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of VD was 8 per 10 000 dogs (95% CI = 7-9). Median age at first diagnosis was 12.68 years (interquartile range [IQR], 11.28-14.64). Compared with crossbreeds, breeds with the highest odds of VD diagnosis included French Bulldogs (odds ratio [OR] = 9.25, 95% CI = 4.81-17.76, P &lt; .001), Bulldogs (OR = 6.53, 95% CI = 2.66-16.15, P &lt; .001), King Charles Spaniels (OR = 4.96, 95% CI = 2.52-9.78, P &lt; .001), Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 2.50-5.06, P &lt; .001), and Springer Spaniels (OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 2.52-4.52, P &lt; .001). The most common presenting signs were head tilt (69.8%), nystagmus (68.1%), and ataxia (64.5%). The most frequently used treatments were antiemetics (43.2%), systemic glucocorticoids (33.1%), antimicrobials (25%), and propentofylline (23.25%). There were 3.6% of cases referred. Improvement was recorded in 41.8% cases after a median of 4 days (IQR, 2-10.25). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies strong breed predispositions for VD. The low referral rates suggest that primary-care data sources offer more generalizable information for benchmarking to help clinicians review their own clinical activities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGuinness, S J</author><author>Friend, E J</author><author>Knowler, S P</author><author>Jeffery, N D</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Progression of otitis media with effusion in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>315</pages><volume>172</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Incidental Findings</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23418182</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.101337</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, A D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Giardiosis and colitis in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>444-447</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Colitis</keyword><keyword>Diarrhea</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Giardiasis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1980</year></dates><accession-num>7458785</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.1980.tb02640.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 18-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with recurrent diarrhoea for 2  months had signs suggesting dysfunction of small and large bowel.

Additionally, breed-specific reference ranges for CKCS MV measurements are lacking. Study objectives were to assess measurement repeatability and define optimal methods for the longitudinal study of echocardiographic MV anatomy and to define preliminary, two-dimensional echocardiographic reference ranges for MV measurements in CKCS. ANIMALS: Forty CKCS between 10 and 24 months old. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre- and post-sedation two-dimensional echocardiographic images optimized for the MV were obtained. The length, width, and area of the anterior and posterior leaflets and the diameter of the MV annulus at end-diastole and end-systole were measured. Measurement repeatability was assessed using % coefficient of variation and repeatability coefficients. RESULTS: Intraoperator repeatability was best for the operator with previous MV measurement experience, with comparable results for the experienced operator measuring the second operator's images, mimicking a core echocardiography laboratory setting. Except for MV annulus diameter at end-systole, sedation had no significant effect on any MV measurements, nor did it impact measurement repeatability. Preliminary, breed-specific reference ranges were defined for the population, with CKCS often noted to have a larger annular diameter at end-systole than end-diastole. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal methods for longitudinal study of the MV in CKCS have been proposed, as have two-dimensional preliminary echocardiographic reference ranges for CKCS MV measurements. The MV annulus in CKCS may differ from other breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bayton, William</author><author>Watson, Penny J</author><author>Bexfield, Nicholas H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prednisolone therapy for chronic hepatitis in English springer spaniels: a  prospective study of 12 cases.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>e21</pages><volume>186</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32051291</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.105642</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: English springer spaniels (ESS) show an increased risk of chronic  hepatitis (CH). In a previous study of 68 ESS with CH, in which only one dog received corticosteroids, a median survival time of 189 days was noted. Some ESS with CH appear to improve with prednisolone treatment; therefore, we aimed to investigate the response to prednisolone in this breed. PARTICIPANTS: ESS with histologically confirmed idiopathic CH were treated with prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day. Nine female and three male ESS were enrolled (median age at diagnosis of five years). Patients were monitored clinically and had biochemistry samples taken to assess markers of hepatocellular damage and function. RESULTS: The mean starting dose of prednisolone was 1.1 mg/kg/day. All symptomatic patients showed an initial clinical improvement. Two cases were euthanased while receiving prednisolone. The median time since diagnosis is 1715 days (range: 672-2105 days) and the remaining patients are clinically well, with seven patients still receiving a mean dose of 0.4 mg/kg prednisolone every other day. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant (P&lt;0.05) reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin following 2-4 weeks of prednisolone treatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates improved clinical and biochemical parameters when some ESS with CH are managed with prednisolone and standard supportive treatments.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harcourt-Brown, Thomas R</author><author>Parker, John E</author><author>Granger, Nicolas</author><author>Jeffery, Nick D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of middle ear effusion on the brain-stem auditory evoked response of  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>341-345</pages><volume>188</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Auditory Threshold</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hearing Loss, Conductive</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21194995</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.05.018</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER) were assessed in 23 Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels with and without middle ear effusion at sound intensities ranging from 10 to 100 dB nHL. Significant differences were found between the median BAER threshold for ears where effusions were present (60 dB nHL), compared to those without (30 dB nHL) (P=0.001). The slopes of latency-intensity functions from both groups did not differ, but the y-axis intercept when the x value was zero was greater in dogs with effusions (P=0.009), consistent with conductive hearing loss. Analysis of latency-intensity functions suggested the degree of hearing loss due to middle ear effusion was 21 dB (95% confidence between 10 and 33 dB). Waves I-V inter-wave latency at 90 dB nHL was not significantly different between the two groups. These findings demonstrate that middle ear effusion is associated with a conductive hearing loss of 10-33 dB in affected dogs despite the fact that all animals studied were considered to have normal hearing by their owners.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diesel, G</author><author>Pfeiffer, D</author><author>Crispin, S</author><author>Brodbelt, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk factors for tail injuries in dogs in Great Britain.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>812-817</pages><volume>166</volume><issue>26</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Tail</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20581358</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.b4880</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The aim of the current study was to quantify the risk of tail injury, to evaluate  the extent to which tail docking reduces this risk, and to identify other major risk factors for tail injury in dogs in Great Britain. A nested case-control study was conducted during 2008 and 2009. Data were obtained from a stratified random sample of veterinary practices throughout Great Britain, and questionnaires were sent to owners of dogs with tail injuries and owners of a randomly selected sample of dogs without tail injuries. The risks of injury were reported adjusting for the sampling approach, and mixed effects logistic regression was used to develop a multivariable model for risk factors associated with tail injury. Two hundred and eighty-one tail injuries were recorded from a population of 138,212 dogs attending 52 participating practices. The weighted risk of tail injuries was 0.23 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 0.20 to 0.25 per cent). Thirty-six per cent of injuries were reportedly related to injuries sustained in the home, 17.5 per cent were outdoor-related injuries, 14.4 per cent were due to the tail being caught in a door, for 16.5 per cent the cause was unknown and the remainder were due to other causes. Dogs with a wide angle of wag and dogs kept in kennels were at significantly higher risk of sustaining a tail injury. Dogs with docked tails were significantly less likely to sustain a tail injury; however, approximately 500 dogs would need to be docked in order to prevent one tail injury. English springer spaniels, cocker spaniels, greyhounds, lurchers and whippets were all at significantly higher risk when compared to labradors and other retrievers. Differences between countries (England, Scotland and Wales) and between rural and urban environments were not significant.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Kristensen, A T</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Jensen, A L</author><author>Klitgaard, B</author><author>Hansson, H</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increased platelet aggregation response in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with  mitral valve prolapse.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>209-216</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnesium</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11380029</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2001)015&lt;0209:parick&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a fundamental feature of myxomatous mitral valve  disease in the dog. In humans, primary MVP is associated with increased platelet reactivity. In Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), a breed predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease, there is a high prevalence of hypomagnesemia and platelet anomalies, such as thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate platelet aggregation responses in CKCS and to determine the relationship between the platelet aggregation response and serum magnesium concentration, MVP, mitral regurgitation (MR), and platelet count. In 19 CKCS with MVP and 7 control dogs (not CKCS), the platelet aggregation response to 3 different agonists was compared. The CKCS with &gt;100,000 platelets/microL (n = 10) had a significantly higher maximum aggregation response with regard to all tested agonists than the CKCS with &lt;100,000 platelets/microL (n = 9) and control dogs (n = 7). The CKCS with &lt;100,000 platelets/microL had a platelet aggregation response similar to the control dogs. There was no correlation between degree of MVP and platelet aggregation response. Platelet diameter increased (P = .006) and serum magnesium concentration decreased (P = .04) with lower platelet concentration. In conclusion, CKCS with MVP appeared to separate into 2 groups--1 group with &lt;100,000 platelets/microL, normal platelet aggregation, low serum magnesium concentration, and enlarged platelets, and another group with &gt;100,000 platelets/microL, increased platelet aggregation, and normal serum magnesium concentration and platelet size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frazier, K S</author><author>Hines, M E 2nd</author><author>Hurvitz, A I</author><author>Robinson, P G</author><author>Herron, A J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of DNA aneuploidy and c-myc oncoprotein content of canine plasma cell  tumors using flow cytometry.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>505-511</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA, Neoplasm</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Plasmacytoma</keyword><keyword>Ploidies</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><accession-num>8116143</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/030098589303000603</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>To derive a method for determining malignant potential of plasma cell tumors, a  retrospective analysis of the DNA ploidy and relative p62c-myc oncoprotein content using bivariate flow cytometry was performed on 23 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 23 dogs. The samples included one tissue each from 17 males and six females 2 to 16 years of age (mean = 7.5 years). Twelve breeds were represented, including three Cocker Spaniels, three Golden Retrievers, and five of mixed breed. Ten of the samples were histologically classified as malignant-plasma cell tumors, and ten specimens were classified as benign. Three samples of plasmacytic inflammation, from two Cocker Spaniels and one Shih Tsu, were included as controls. The ploidy and relative c-myc content data obtained were compared with the histologic grade. A significant difference in ploidy was found between benign and malignant tumors (P &lt; or = 0.05). Five of nine malignant plasma cell tumors were aneuploid; the remainder were diploid (4/9) or tetraploid (1/9). Only one of the benign plasmacytomas was aneuploid (1/10), whereas six were diploid (6/10), and three were tetraploid (3/10). All of the controls were diploid (3/32). When relative amounts of p62c-myc from malignant and benign tumors were compared by flow cytometry, a greater significant difference was established (P &lt; or = 0.01) than bu using aneuploidy alone. Relative values of p62c-myc content ranged from 219 to 553 units in 8/10 malignant plasma cell tumors and from 86 to 392 units in 3/10 benign plasmacytomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gould, David</author><author>Pettitt, Louise</author><author>McLaughlin, Bryan</author><author>Holmes, Nigel</author><author>Forman, Oliver</author><author>Thomas, Anne</author><author>Ahonen, Saija</author><author>Lohi, Hannes</author><author>O'Leary, Caroline</author><author>Sargan, David</author><author>Mellersh, Cathryn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADAMTS17 mutation associated with primary lens luxation is widespread among  breeds.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>378-384</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>ADAM Proteins</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Genotyping Techniques</keyword><keyword>Lens Subluxation</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22050825</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2011.00892.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Primary lens luxation (PLL) is a well-recognized, painful and potentially  blinding inherited ocular condition in dogs. We screened PLL-affected dogs of 30 different breeds, to identify those which carried a previously described c.1473+1 G&gt;A mutation in ADAMTS17 that is associated with PLL in Miniature Bull terriers, Lancashire Heelers, and Jack Russell terriers. This ADAMTS17 mutation was identified in PLL-affected dogs from 14 additional breeds. PLL-affected dogs from some breeds (most notably the Shar pei and the Brittany spaniel) did not carry the G1473+1A ADAMTS17 mutation, indicating they must suffer from a genetically distinct form of the condition. We also estimated the frequency of this ADAMTS17 mutation in some of the breeds. Our findings indicate the mutation segregates in a large number of different breeds of dog, many of which are terriers or breeds with terrier co-ancestry, but some of which have more diverse origins. Our results also indicate that the mutation is present at high frequency within most of the breeds in which it segregates. In the miniature bull terrier breed estimates of mutation frequency ranged from 0.27 to 0.39, corresponding to 7.3-15.2% PLL-affected dogs in this breed. We also identified an increased risk of PLL associated with heterozygosity at ADAMTS17, suggesting that carriers carry a low risk of developing PLL.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaul, K R</author><author>Karnia, J J</author><author>Skinner, O T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomography of a spontaneous subserosal duodenal haematoma in a cavalier  king Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>932</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hematoma</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34076281</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13376</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saunders, G K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cranial nerve hamartoma in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>253-254</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cranial Nerve Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Hamartoma</keyword><keyword>Histocytochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17317811</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1354/vp.44-2-253</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 11-year-old, male, neutered Cavalier King Charles spaniel was euthanatized  because of recurrent seizures and inflammatory bowel disease.

Matings between dogs thought to be heterozygous for ICS resulted in 22 pups, five (three males and two females) of which were homozygous for ICS. Four of the five ICS-affected dogs had chronic rhinitis and bronchopneumonia. The other dog had a serious nasal discharge and died at 10 days. Four dogs had situs inversus totalis (kartagener syndrome), and the two males of reproductive age were azoospermic. In the two ICS dogs studied for ciliary function, in vivo mucociliary clearance was absent, and in vitro ciliary beat was rarely observed and of low frequency. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy disclosed the same lesions in respiratory cilia from all dogs with ICS, including random orientation and partial outer dynein arm deficiency. Four of five dogs with ICS had dilated lateral ventricles. One female pup with neonatal rhinitis and bronchopneumonia, situs solitus, and dilated lateral ventricles was presumed to be homozygous for ICS, but died without functional or structural confirmation of defective respiratory cilia. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the ciliary defects and respiratory signs of ICS in these dogs is proposed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Di Tosto, Martin</author><author>Callegari, Carolina</author><author>Matiasek, Kaspar</author><author>Lacava, Giuseppe</author><author>Salvatore, Giovanna</author><author>Muñoz Declara, Sara</author><author>Betti, Barbara</author><author>Tirrito, Federica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Case report: Atypical and chronic masticatory muscle myositis in a 5-month old  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The disease is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against 2M myofibers contained in masticatory muscle, although the cause of this production is still unclear. The aim of the present case report was to describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, treatment, and follow-up of an atypical case of chronic masticatory muscle myositis in a very young dog. A 5-month old Cavalier king Charles Spaniel (CKCS) was presented to the AniCura Istituto Veterinario Novara with a two weeks, progressive history of lethargy and difficulty in food prehension. Neurological examination revealed bilateral masticatory muscle atrophy, mandibular ptosis with the jaw kept open, inability to close the mouth without manual assistance, jaw pain, and bilateral reduction of palpebral reflex and menace reaction; vision was maintained. A myopathy was suspected. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for 2M antibodies, and histopathological examination of masticatory muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of MMM. Glucocorticoids treatment was started and clinical signs promptly improved. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case describing mandibular ptosis in a dog affected by chronic MMM, successfully managed with medical treatment and the first report describing the CT and MRI findings in a young CKCS affected by MMM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foster, A P</author><author>Sturgess, C P</author><author>Gould, D J</author><author>Iwasaki, T</author><author>Day, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pemphigus foliaceus in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, and  subsequent lymphoma in a cocker spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>266-270</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pemphigus</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10879406</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2000.tb03938.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A seven-year-old neutered male cocker spaniel was presented with an 11-month  history of generalised bacterial dermatitis. There were skin lesions over the entire body, which were round, slightly raised and encrusted. Skin biopsies were collected and the histological findings were consistent with pemphigus foliaceus. Immunohistochemical staining by the indirect immunoperoxidase method was positive, with desmosomal deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Haematological analysis revealed a regenerative anaemia and profound thrombocytopenia, while a Coombs' test was positive for polyvalent canine Coombs' reagent and anti-dog IgG. An antinuclear antibody test was positive, with a titre of 10,240. An ophthalmic examination demonstrated low tear production (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Seven months after initial referral, the dog was re-presented with severe generalised peripheral lymphadenopathy. Radiographic evaluation of the thorax and abdomen revealed enlarged cranial mediastinal and sublumbar lymph nodes. Tru-Cut biopsy from an enlarged lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma, which was phenotyped as a B-cell tumour. The diagnosis in this case was systemic lupus erythematosus, with the unusual feature of pemphigus foliaceus, and subsequent development of B-cell lymphoma. The case adds further to knowledge of the protean clinical presentations of canine autoimmune diseases and provides additional evidence for the potential association between autoimmunity and immune-system neoplasia in this species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyers-Wallen, V N</author><author>Palmer, V L</author><author>Acland, G M</author><author>Hershfield, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sry-negative XX sex reversal in the American cocker spaniel dog.</title><secondary-title>Molecular reproduction and development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular reproduction and development</full-title></periodical><pages>300-305</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genes, Homeobox</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Proteins</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Sex Determination Analysis</keyword><keyword>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8588928</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/mrd.1080410304</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The Sry gene product serves an important function in male sex determination  through testis induction. However, testicular development has been reported in SRY-negative XX sex reversed humans. XX sex reversal of the American cocker spaniel, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, may be a homolog of this disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Sry high mobility group (HMG) box is present in genomic DNA of affected dogs. Conserved Sry HMG box and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) sequences were used as primers in polymerase chain reactions. A 167 bp Y-specific canine Sry HMG box sequence was cloned from genomic DNA of normal male dogs. Internal primers generated a 104 bp Sry HMG box product from normal males, but not from females or XX sex reversed dogs. Parallel reactions generated an HPRT product from all dogs. Results indicate that the Sry HMG box is absent in genomic DNA of XX sex reversed dogs. We speculate that activation of the testis differentiation cascade in the absence of Sry in this model is due to a mutant autosomal gene.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Öberg, Josefine</author><author>Lilliehöök, Inger</author><author>Höglund, Katja</author><author>Ljungvall, Ingrid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hemostatic function in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels assessed using  thromboelastography.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>636-644</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Hemostasis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Thrombelastography</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31650577</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12795</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Macrothrombocytopenia is a well-known anomaly in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels (CKCSs), a breed also highly predisposed to develop myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Thromboelastography (TEG) has been shown to be a valuable instrument for whole blood hemostatic evaluation in dogs and correlates well with different physiologic and pathologic situations. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the influence of macrothrombocytopenia and the severity of MMVD on hemostatic function as measured by TEG. METHODS: Associations between TEG variables (R, K, α, MA, and G) and dog characteristics, heart rates, systolic blood pressures, MMVD severities (healthy, mild or moderate, and severe), echocardiographic variables, platelet variables (platelet count, mean platelet volume [MPV], and plateletcrit), and hematocrits were evaluated in 47 prospectively recruited privately owned CKCSs. Blood samples were analyzed using a computerized thromboelastograph and an Advia 2120 hematology analyzer. RESULTS: Univariable and multiple regression analyses showed an effect of left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening (FS%) on all TEG variables, an effect of LV FS% and age on TEG α, and an effect of LV FS% and MPV on TEG MA and TEG G. TEG MA and G increased with increasing MPV, but the associations were generally weak. No significant differences were detected in the TEG variables between the MMVD severity groups. CONCLUSION: Macrothrombocytopenia and increased LV FS%, of which the latter commonly increases in various positive inotropic states, were both associated with a more hypercoagulable hemostatic system, according to the TEG results, in the present study.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birkegård, A C</author><author>Reimann, M J</author><author>Martinussen, T</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breeding Restrictions Decrease the Prevalence of Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease  in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels over an 8- to 10-Year Period.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>63-68</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26578464</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.13663</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are predisposed to myxomatous  mitral valve disease (MMVD). Studies have indicated a strong genetic background. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a breeding scheme involving auscultation and echocardiography. ANIMALS: In the Danish Kennel Club mandatory breeding scheme, 997 purebred CKCS were examined during the period 2002-2011. Each dog was evaluated 1-4 times with a total of 1,380 examinations. METHODS: Auscultation and echocardiography were performed to evaluate mitral regurgitation murmur severity and degree of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The odds of having mitral regurgitation murmur or MVP &gt; grade 1 in 2010-2011 compared to 2002-2003 were estimated using logistic regression analysis including age and sex as covariates. Odds were estimated for dogs that were products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with both parents approved by the breeding scheme before breeding) and non-products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with at least 1 parent with unknown cardiac status). RESULTS: In 2010-2011, the odds of having mitral regurgitation murmur were 0.27 if dogs were a product of the breeding scheme compared with dogs in 2002-2003, reflecting a 73% decreased risk (P &lt; .0001). If non-products of the breeding scheme examined in 2010-2011 were compared with dogs in 2002-2003, no difference in odds was found (P = .49). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A mandatory breeding scheme based on auscultation and echocardiography findings significantly decreased the prevalence of MMVD over the 8- to 10-year period. Such a breeding scheme therefore is recommended for CKCS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rutherford, Lynda</author><author>Wessmann, Annette</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>McGonnell, Imelda M</author><author>Abeyesinghe, Siobhan</author><author>Burn, Charlotte</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Questionnaire-based behaviour analysis of Cavalier King Charles spaniels with  neuropathic pain due to Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>294-298</pages><volume>194</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Europe</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>North America</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22738740</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.05.018</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CM)/syringomyelia (SM) is a disease complex recognised  in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) that can lead to neuropathic pain (NeP). In humans, NeP is associated with anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life (QoL). In this study, databases of three specialist veterinary centres were searched and CKCS breed societies and health forums were contacted to identify CKCS with an imaging diagnosis of CM/SM. Owners completed questionnaires on behaviour, signalment, general health status, NeP and QoL. Data were analysed from 122 dogs out of 564 questionnaires completed, after incomplete questionnaires and data from dogs that had other potentially debilitating disease processes were excluded. NeP severity score was significantly and positively correlated with 'stranger-directed' fear (r(S)=0.28), non-social fear (r(S)=0.34), 'separation-related' behaviour (r(S)=0.38), attachment behaviour (r(S)=0.24), excitability (r(S)=0.21) and proxy for pain sensation (r(S)=0.29). Increased NeP was also significantly associated with decreased QoL (r(S)=0.47), ability to settle (r(S)=0.26) and willingness to exercise (r(S)=0.50). Severity of NeP was positively associated with certain fear-associated behaviour and with decreased owner-perceived QoL. Thus, neurobehavioural changes should be considered in the management of NeP in CKCS with CM/SM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harcourt-Brown, Thomas R</author><author>Belshaw, Zoe</author><author>Parker, John E</author><author>Jeffery, Nick D</author><author>Granger, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of syringomyelia on electrodiagnostic test results in Cavalier King  Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>595-600</pages><volume>72</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cervical Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electromyography</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Motor</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Median Nerve</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21529209</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/ajvr.72.5.595</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of syringomyelia on electromyography (EMG)  findings, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (TMMEPs) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs). ANIMALS: 27 client-owned CKCSs that underwent prebreeding magnetic resonance imaging screening or investigation of clinical signs consistent with syringomyelia. PROCEDURES: In dogs with (n = 11) and without (16) magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed syringomyelia, the median nerve in each thoracic limb was stimulated and SEPs were recorded over the C1 vertebra; onset latency and latency and amplitude of the largest negative (N1) and positive (P1) peaks were measured. The TMMEPs were recorded bilaterally from the extensor carpi radialis and tibialis cranialis muscles; onset latencies in all 4 limbs were measured. Bilateral systematic needle EMG examination was performed on the cervical epaxial musculature, and the number of sites with spontaneous activity was recorded. RESULTS: In dogs with syringomyelia, amplitudes of N1 and P1 and the amplitude difference between P1 and N1 were significantly smaller than those recorded for dogs without syringomyelia (approx 2-fold difference). No difference in SEP latencies, TMMEP latencies, or the proportion of dogs with &gt; 2 sites of spontaneous activity detected during EMG examination was detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that SEP amplitude at the C1 vertebra was a more sensitive measure of spinal cord function in CKCSs with syringomyelia, compared with results of EMG or TMMEP assessment. Measurement of SEP amplitude may have use as an objective assessment of the evolution and treatment of this disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bertazzolo, W</author><author>Comazzi, S</author><author>Sesso, L</author><author>Scarpa, P</author><author>Ru, G</author><author>Paltrinieri, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of methods for determining platelet numbers and volume in Cavalier  King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>556-561</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bernard-Soulier Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Tests, Routine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Italy</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17543023</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00319.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare platelet concentration in  cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) measured by different methods commonly used in veterinary hospitals and commercial laboratories. METHODS: Blood samples obtained from 41 CKCS [corrected] were analysed by impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation. Quantitative buffy coat analysis was performed only on 17 samples, selected from CKCS [corrected] that had low platelet counts detected by cell counters. Platelet counts, platelet estimations and platelet parameters using these different methods were compared. RESULTS: The median platelet number was lower when estimated using impedance cell counter (1363x10(9)/I) with respect to laser cell counter (1723x10(9)/I), microscopic estimation (238x10(9)/I) [corrected] or quantitative buffy coat analyser (292x10(9)/I) [corrected] (P&lt;0.01). Although impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation were positively correlated, there was no acceptable agreement among methods. CKCS [corrected] with macrothrombocytes in blood smears had significantly lower counts on impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation. The percentages of CKCS [corrected] with platelet count &lt; 100x10(9)/I [corrected] were 34.1 per cent (impedance cell counter), 26.8 per cent (laser cell counter), 22.0 per cent (microscopic estimation) (not statistically different) and 5.8 per cent (quantitative buffy coat analyser) (P&lt;0.05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CKCS [corrected] with macrothrombocytosis have low platelet counts on impedance cell counters, laser cell counters and microscopic estimation. CKCS [corrected] with low platelet counts may have a normal platelet crit detected by a quantitative buffy coat analyser and thus a normal circulating platelet mass.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Mow, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hypomagnesemia and mitral valve prolapse in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

In humans, MVP is known to be associated with a low magnesium status. In this study, the plasma magnesium concentration was measured in 30 CKCS without heart failure. It was also investigated whether MVP-severity and degree of regurgitation correlated with plasma magnesium and a number of parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, and whether 4 weeks magnesium supplementation affected plasma magnesium or the high renin/low aldosterone profile associated with MVP. A high prevalence of hypomagnesemia was observed: plasma concentrations &lt; 0.70 mmol/l were found in 15 dogs (50%) before and in 12 dogs (40%) after 4 weeks magnesium supplementation. The mean plasma level was 0.69 +/- 0.07 mmol/l before and 0.71 +/- 0.07 mmol/l after magnesium (P = 0.22). Plasma magnesium concentrations did not correlate with MVP-severity and degree of regurgitation. Plasma aldosterone levels correlated negatively with MVP-severity and positively with the degree of regurgitation, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activities correlated negatively with the degree of regurgitation. Magnesium supplementation had no effects on renin and aldosterone nor on the ratio between the two. In conclusion, many CKCS without heart failure have hypomagnesemia whether they are fed supplementary magnesium or not--a finding which may be associated with the high prevalence of MVP in this breed. Further studies, however, are needed to clarify the role of a low magnesium status in canine MVP.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Herynek, Vit</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author><author>Dezortova, Monika</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Hajek, Milan</author><author>Kozeny, Jiri</author><author>Dockery, Colleen</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Magnetic resonance relaxometry in monozygotic twins discordant and concordant for  schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists</full-title></periodical><pages>41-44</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Antipsychotic Agents</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Diseases in Twins</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Twins, Monozygotic</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15642442</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eurpsy.2004.11.004</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>T1 and T2 relaxation times were examined in four pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins  discordant and concordant for schizophrenia with low and high genetic loading for the illness and five healthy control MZ twin pairs.

METHODS: A retrospective review of the Comparative Ocular Pathology Laboratory of Wisconsin database revealed 153 canine evisceration or enucleation submissions that met inclusion criteria. The most commonly represented breeds were identified, and enucleated globes of these breeds were further evaluated histologically (n = 69). Following standard hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining, globes were evaluated for the presence of; corneal pathology, goniodysgenesis, pigment dispersion, pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes (PIFVMs), peripheral anterior, and/or posterior synechiation, inflammatory infiltrates, lens pathology, retinal pathology, and/or endophthalmitis. RESULTS: The most significantly represented breeds were the Cocker Spaniel (11.7%), Boston Terrier (10.5%), Labrador Retriever (6.5%), Bichon Frise (6.5%), Shih Tzu (5.8%), and Jack Russell Terrier (5.8%). Common histopathologic findings included inflammatory keratitis, the presence of PIFVMs, and lymphoplasmacytic uveal infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: The Cocker Spaniel, Boston Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Bichon Frise, Shih Tzu, and Jack Russell Terrier may be at increased risk of the development of glaucoma following elective cataract surgery. These findings have potential clinical implications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patel, Jay M</author><author>Rosypal, Alexa C</author><author>Zimmerman, Kurt L</author><author>Monroe, William E</author><author>Sriranganathan, Nammalwar</author><author>Zajac, Anne M</author><author>Yabsley, Michael J</author><author>Lindsay, David S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isolation, mouse pathogenicity, and genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi from an  English Cocker Spaniel from Virginia, USA.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary parasitology</full-title></periodical><pages>394-398</pages><volume>187</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chagas Disease</keyword><keyword>DNA, Protozoan</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred C3H</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred ICR</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma cruzi</keyword><keyword>Virginia</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22341614</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.01.031</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Trypanosoma cruzi was demonstrated in blood smears and heart tissue from a 5-year  old, female, English Cocker Spaniel that had never been outside of the state of Virginia, USA. Plasma from the dog was positive in a commercially available immunochromatographic dipstick assay for T. cruzi and negative in an immunochromatographic dipstick assay for visceral Leishmania spp. The plasma from the dog had an indirect immunofluorescent antibody titer of 1:800 against epimastigotes of T. cruzi while the titer was 1:50 against promastigotes of L. infantum. The parasite was isolated from the blood in vitro from the dog (TcVT-1 isolate) and used to experimentally infect female C3H and ICR mice. The parasite was nonpathogenic for experimentally inoculated mice. DNA was isolated from parasites grown in vitro and used to determine that the genotype of T. cruzi present in the dog was genotype TcIV. This genotype is common in raccoons, Procyon lotor, in North America and suggests that raccoons may serve as reservoirs for canine infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baba, E</author><author>Fukata, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence of otitis externa in dogs and cats in Japan.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>393-395</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections</keyword><keyword>Japan</keyword><keyword>Otitis Externa</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>Streptococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1981</year></dates><accession-num>7027593</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.108.18.393</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The incidence of otitis externa in dogs and cats admitted to the animal hospital  of the University of Osaka Prefecture was investigated and the bacteria isolated were tested for antibiotic susceptibility.

The organisms most commonly associated with otitis externa were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococci and Escherichia coli. Most staphylococci were susceptible to the antibiotics tested, but 15 per cent of staphylococci were resistant to more than three antibiotics. Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes species were resistant to almost all antibiotics except gentamicin and colistin.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Braund, K G</author><author>Luttgen, P J</author><author>Sorjonen, D C</author><author>Redding, R W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Idiopathic facial paralysis in the dog.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>297-299</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Facial Paralysis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1979</year></dates><accession-num>516320</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.105.13.297</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Facial nerve paralysis of acute onset is reported in seven mature dogs, five of  which were cocker spaniels. The clinical signs were characterised by ear drooping, lip commissural paralysis, sialosis, and collection of food on the paralysed side of the mouth. All dogs showed absent menace responses and trigeminofacial/acousticofacial reflexes. Horner's syndrome was not present in any dog. In four dogs, bilateral facial paralysis developed. The facial paralysis was unrelated to otitis media. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed denervation potentials and absent evoked muscle potentials. Facial nerve biopsies from two cases showed nerve fibre degeneration and apparent loss of larger diameter myelinated fibres. The condition has been termed idiopathic facial paralysis since the aetiopathogenesis is presently unknown.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schettler, Michael</author><author>Cassel, Nicky</author><author>Elliot, Ross C</author><author>Fosgate, Geoffrey T</author><author>Schettler, Keleigh</author><author>Biller, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Prevalence Study of Canine Humeral Condylar Fractures Over a Ten-Year Period at  an Academic Teaching Hospital.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>191-197</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Animal</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Teaching</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35644140</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/s-0042-1744445</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, breed  predisposition and fracture conformation of humeral condylar fractures (HCF) over a 10-year period. Results were compared with published studies emanating from the United Kingdom exploring effect of breed on HCF. METHODS:  Data for all canine admissions to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Kansas State University were extracted for the period January 2010 to October 2020. Humeral fractures were recorded and further subclassified as medial, lateral and 'T'/'Y' condylar fractures. The associations between HCF and subtypes with breed were assessed using univariate logistic regression with a comparison group. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of breed while accounting for dog age, sex and neuter status. RESULTS:  Of the 44,952 canine patients seen during the study period, period prevalence (95% confidence interval [CI] for HCF was 0.26% [0.22, 0.31]). After adjustment for age and neuter status, French Bulldogs were 49 times more likely to be diagnosed with a HCF compared with the comparison breed group (odds ratio [OR], 49.0; 95% CI, 26.9-89.3). After adjustment for age and neuter status, Cocker Spaniels (OR, 42.8; 95% CI, 16.8-108.6), Boston Terriers (OR, 22.9; 95% CI, 11.0-47.9) and Brittany Spaniels (OR, 21.5; 95% CI, 7.3-63.1) had the next highest increase in HCF compared with the comparison group. CONCLUSION:  Based on a study population from the United States, French Bulldogs were 49 times more likely to be diagnosed with a HCF compared with the comparison breed group.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Inal Gultekin, G</author><author>Raj, K</author><author>Lehman, S</author><author>Hillström, A</author><author>Giger, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Missense mutation in PFKM associated with muscle-type phosphofructokinase  deficiency in the Wachtelhund dog.</title><secondary-title>Molecular and cellular probes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular and cellular probes</full-title></periodical><pages>243-247</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Conserved Sequence</keyword><keyword>DNA Mutational Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Association Studies</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phosphofructokinases</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22446493</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mcp.2012.02.004</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary muscle-type phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency causing intermittent  hemolytic anemia and exertional myopathy due to a single nonsense mutation in PFKM has been previously described in English Springer and American Cocker Spaniels, Whippets, and mixed breed dogs. We report here on a new missense mutation associated with PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds. Coding regions of the PFKM gene were amplified from genomic DNA and/or cDNA reverse-transcribed from RNA of EDTA blood of PFK-deficient and clinically healthy Wachtelhunds and control dogs. The amplicons were sequenced and compared to the published canine PFKM sequence. A point mutation (c.550C&gt;T, in the coding sequence of PFKM expressed in blood) was found in all 4 affected Wachtelhunds. This missense mutation results in an amino acid substitution of arginine (Arg) to tryptophan (Trp) at position 184 of the protein expressed in blood (p.Arg184Trp). The mutation is located within an alpha-helix, and based on the SIFT analysis, this amino acid substitution is not tolerated. Amplifying the region around this mutation and digesting the PCR fragment with the restriction enzyme MspI, produces fragments that readily differentiate between PFK-deficient, carrier, and normal animals. Furthermore, we document 2 additional upstream PFKM exons expressed in canine testis but not in blood. Despite their similar phenotypic appearance and use for hunting, Wachtelhunds and English Springer Spaniels are not thought to have common ancestors. Thus, it is not surprising that different mutations are responsible for PFK deficiency in these breeds. Knowledge of the molecular basis of PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds provides an opportunity to screen and control the spread of this deleterious trait.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biella, U</author><author>Haustein, U F</author><author>Seifert, S</author><author>Adler, J</author><author>Schüppel, K F</author><author>Eulenberger, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Psoriasis in a female chimpanzee].</title><secondary-title>Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete</full-title></periodical><pages>322-323</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Zoo</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Climate</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pan troglodytes</keyword><keyword>Psoriasis</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year></dates><accession-num>1874622</accession-num><language>ger</language><urls/><abstract>Psoriasis, a widespread genodermatosis in Homo sapiens, also appears in primates.

It may be that both previous infections and psychic stress resulting from social isolation had caused eruption of the disease. In the literature single cases of psoriasiform dermatoses have also been described in other species of monkeys and even in a springer spaniel.

It is associated with increased R-R interval variability. Little is known about response to physiological factors and whether iMR is a precursor for developing significant MR. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate, and short-term (1-2 year) progression of MR in CKCS with and without iMR. In total, 52 CKCS were included. Substudy 1 enrolled six dogs with iMR and 11 dogs without iMR. Substudy 2 enrolled 14 dogs with iMR and 28 dogs without iMR. Substudy 1 prospectively assessed the influence of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate. Substudy 2 retrospectively evaluated short-term progression of iMR. During stress testing, iMR disappeared in 50% of CKCS and no iMR was recorded at mean heart rates &gt;150 beats/min. Heart rate response did not differ between CKCS with or without iMR. CKCS with iMR did not have a higher odds (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-38.2) of MR progression compared to controls (P = 0.1). In conclusion, physical stress influenced the occurrence of iMR in CKCS, but heart rate response was not different from CKCS without iMR. Intermittent mitral regurgitation did not significantly predict short-term MR progression. In stressed CKCS with early disease, iMR may be overlooked.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tetas Pont, Roser</author><author>Matas Riera, Marian</author><author>Newton, Richard</author><author>Donaldson, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Corneal and anterior segment foreign body trauma in dogs: a review of 218 cases.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>386-397</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Corneal Injuries</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Lens, Crystalline</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26359142</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12312</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To review clinical data on dogs that suffered a corneal and anterior  segment foreign body (CASFB) trauma and to determine the risk factors for foreign body (FB) trauma and subsequent enucleation. ANIMALS STUDIED: Dogs with CASFB presented to the Animal Health Trust (AHT) from January 2000 to December 2012. PROCEDURES: Clinical data for CASFB cases were compared to those available for the remaining AHT ophthalmic population over the same period. The depth of the FB trauma was divided into five categories. The type of FB and method of removal were described for each category. The degree of secondary uveitis and lens involvement was graded and correlated with subsequent enucleation. RESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) of 218 identified CASFB cases was 3.96 (2.95) years. Risk factors for CASFB trauma were dogs younger than 5 years, English Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and working dogs. Most dogs required general anesthesia for FB removal, and hypodermic needles were the most commonly used instrument. The lens was involved in some cases with a full-thickness CASFB trauma (n = 49, 45%), but most suffered a minor lens trauma (n = 37, 76%). The lens trauma and phacoclastic uveitis were managed medically in most dogs (n = 37, 76%), and phacoemulsification was only elected as initial treatment in some dogs (n = 10, 20%). Enucleation was required overall in 6% of dogs. Statistically significant associations were found between enucleation and depth of FB trauma, degree of uveitis, and severity of lens trauma (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Young dogs, English Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and working dogs had an increased risk of CASFB trauma. Risk factors for enucleation were full-thickness FB penetration, severe lens trauma, and severe uveitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>García-Sánchez, Gustavo A</author><author>Gil-Carrasco, Félix</author><author>Román, Jesús Jiménez</author><author>Brooks, Dennis E</author><author>Alvarez-Clau, Ana</author><author>Hosgood, Giselle</author><author>Iwabe, Simone</author><author>Moreno-Mendoza, Norma A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in normal and glaucomatous  Cocker Spaniels by scanning laser polarimetry.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>78-87</pages><volume>10 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nerve Fibers</keyword><keyword>Optic Nerve</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retinal Ganglion Cells</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17973838</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00563.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer  in normal and early glaucomatous dogs with scanning laser polarimetry. ANIMALS STUDIED: A total of 45 eyes, 32 normal and 13 glaucomatous eyes, of American Cocker Spaniels with primary glaucoma were used. All eyes were evaluated through a complete neuro-ophthalmic examination, tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy prior to enucleation. METHODS: The retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was measured in anesthetized animals with scanning laser polarimetry (Nerve fiber analyzer, GDx; Laser Diagnostic Technologies, LTD, San Diego, CA, USA). Glaucomatous eyes retained some vision at the time of this study. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 141.69 +/- 18 microm for normal dogs and 105.08 +/- 23.86 microm for visual glaucomatous dogs. The average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the superior and inferior retinal quadrants was 148.03 +/- 8.5 and 141.06 +/- 8.73 microm, respectively, for normal dogs, and 106.61 +/- 25.77 and 107.08 +/- 24.99 microm in the superior and inferior retinal quadrants, respectively, for glaucomatous dogs. The superior to nasal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ratio was 1.45 for normal dogs and 1.26 for visual glaucomatous dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Using scanning laser polarimetry it was possible to detect changes in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in glaucomatous dogs at early stages of the disease. Therefore, this instrument has the potential to improve the clinical management of canine glaucoma by detecting progressive changes to the retinal nerve fiber layer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hansson, Kerstin</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Kvart, Clarence</author><author>Lord, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Left atrial to aortic root indices using two-dimensional and M-mode  echocardiography in cavalier King Charles spaniels with and without left atrial enlargement.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>568-575</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aorta</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Atria</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12502113</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2002.tb01051.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiographic measurement of the left atrium (LA) has  the potential to be more accurate than the standard M-mode method, because the LA body can be measured. We evaluated a 2-D method for measuring LA and aorta (AO) in a right parasternal short-axis view and compared it to the M-mode method. An index for LA size (LA/AO) was calculated in 166 cavalier King Charles spaniels, 56 normal and 110 dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) of varying degrees secondary to chronic valvular disease. In normal dogs, the AO-2-D and LA/AO-2-D did not correlate to body weight (BW) or BW2; whereas, all M-mode values and the LA-2-D were significantly (p &lt; .05) related to both BW parameters. In normal dogs, there was no difference between M-mode and 2-D indices. For all dogs (normal and dogs with MR) there was an 11% bias between the M-mode and 2-D index with the LA/AO-2-D being higher than the LA/AO-M. The association between the mean and the difference of the indices demonstrated a quadratic relationship. Dogs with a mean LA/AO of 2.0-2.5 showed the largest difference between the two indices. Small values for the 2-D coefficients of variation for respiration and stage of diastole were found; 3.4 and 3.1%, respectively. The 2-D index is more sensitive to LA enlargement than the M-mode index.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knowler, Susan Penelope</author><author>Gillstedt, Lena</author><author>Mitchell, Thomas J</author><author>Jovanovik, Jelena</author><author>Volk, Holger Andreas</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pilot study of head conformation changes over time in the Cavalier King Charles  spaniel breed.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>122</pages><volume>184</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Head</keyword><keyword>Pilot Projects</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30635451</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.105135</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Modern interpretation of head conformation in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel  (CKCS) has favoured a smaller, more exaggerated, brachycephalic type than originally described in the 1929 breed standard. Recent research studies identified brachycephaly and reduced hind cranium as two conformational (dysmorphic) features that increase risk for symptomatic Chiari-like malformation and secondary syringomyelia (SM). A prospective pilot study investigated the hypothesis that dysmorphic head features could be assessed visually and correlated with risk of SM. Thirteen CKCS, selected from anonymised photographic evidence, were physically appraised by authorised Kennel Club judges using a head shape checklist. These subjective evaluations were then matched with objective measurements of the cranium (cephalic index and rostrocaudal doming) and their subsequent MRI. A positive correlation (P=0.039) between the judges' checklist score and rostrocaudal doming (hindskull ratio) and a positive correlation between the cephalic index and hindskull ratio (P=0.042) were identified. Five CKCS had no SM and their status tallied with 62 per cent of the judges' evaluation. Although the ability of adjudicators to identify differences in head conformation varied, there was sufficient association between the dysmorphic parameters and the risk of SM to cause concern and propose a larger study in CKCS breed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sewell, Adrian C</author><author>Pankraz, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interference of an algal nutritional supplement with a urinary metabolic  screening test for glycosaminoglycans in a dog suspected to have a storage disease.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>504-507</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Algal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Animal Feed</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Ataxia</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dietary Supplements</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>False Positive Reactions</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glycosaminoglycans</keyword><keyword>Methylene Blue</keyword><keyword>Mucopolysaccharidoses</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24320782</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12096</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The finding of excess urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAG) is the first step in the  laboratory diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). Urinary screening tests are based upon the binding of GAG to dimethylmethylene blue. Alternatively, paper spot tests using toluidine blue are used in human and veterinary laboratory medicine. Positive samples undergo GAG isolation for subsequent characterization. Here, we describe a 3-year-old English Cocker Spaniel with a positive urinary GAG test, but without other clinical signs of MPS. Urine samples were strongly positive with the dimethylmethylene blue test, and isolated GAG subjected to electrophoresis on cellulose acetate revealed a band co-migrating with dermatan sulfate. However, the isolated GAG were resistant to digestion with chondroitinase ABC, suggesting that the band did not represent dermatan sulfate. This was confirmed by mobility of the isolated GAG different from dermatan sulfate on agarose gel electrophoresis. MPS types VI and VII were excluded by enzyme assay. To test the hypothesis of a nutritional source, a healthy control dog was fed the same dog food as the index case. His urine showed a comparable abnormal GAG screening test and electrophoretic pattern. In addition, the analysis of an algal supplement present in the administered dog food showed a similar electrophoretic GAG pattern. The Cocker Spaniel was not available for further testing after withdrawal of the supplement. Algae contain highly sulfated fucans and galactans, and it appears that commercial dog food containing such algal, and possibly other, supplements can give rise to false-positive urinary MPS screening tests.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mathes, Rachel L</author><author>Holmes, Shannon P</author><author>Coleman, Kevin D</author><author>Radlinsky, Mary A G</author><author>Moore, Phillip A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Calvarial hyperostosis presenting as unilateral exophthalmos in a female English  Springer Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>263-270</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exophthalmos</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hyperostosis</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22192474</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2011.00969.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 4-month-old intact female English Springer Spaniel presented to the University  of Georgia Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of unilateral, progressive exophthalmos oculus sinister (OS) of 2 weeks' duration. Complete ophthalmic examination revealed moderate OS exophthalmos and lateral globe deviation. No other abnormalities were noted on physical or ophthalmic examination, ocular ultrasound, complete bloodwork, or thoracic radiography. Skull computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, focal, smoothly irregular, cavitated, expansile bony lesion involving the left caudal maxillary and left frontal bones. Biopsies, obtained through a frontal sinusotomy approach to preserve the left globe integrity, demonstrated normal reactive trabecular bone with locally extensive fibrosis. Calvarial hyperostosis was diagnosed based upon appearance on imaging, lesion unilaterality, absence of mandibular involvement, and histopathology. Six months after initial presentation, skull CT was repeated and marked reduction in the degree of frontal bone thickening was demonstrated with complete resolution of cavitations. There was marked clinical improvement with mild, nonpainful exophthalmos, and lateral globe deviation OS on ophthalmic examination. Eleven months after initial presentation, there was complete resolution of the frontal bone lesion with mild thickening of the left calvarial bones on repeat skull CT. There was no exophthalmos or globe deviation present on clinical ophthalmic examination. The proliferative osteopathic lesion was self-resolving with resolution of the exophthalmos and has not recurred to date. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of calvarial hyperostosis in a previously unreported breed presenting as unilateral exophthalmos.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cameron, Jessie M</author><author>Maj, Mary C</author><author>Levandovskiy, Valeriy</author><author>MacKay, Neviana</author><author>Shelton, G Diane</author><author>Robinson, Brian H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a canine model of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1  deficiency.</title><secondary-title>Molecular genetics and metabolism</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular genetics and metabolism</full-title></periodical><pages>15-23</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Physical Conditioning, Animal</keyword><keyword>Point Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)-Phosphatase</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17095275</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ymgme.2006.09.011</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Exercise intolerance syndromes are well known to be associated with inborn errors  of metabolism affecting glycolysis (phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase deficiency) and fatty acid oxidation (palmitoyl carnitine transferase deficiency). We have identified a canine model for profound exercise intolerance caused by a deficit in PDP1 (EC 3.1.3.43), the phosphatase enzyme that activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc). The Clumber spaniel breed was originated in 1760 by the Duc de Noailles, as a hunting dog with a gentle temperament suitable for the 'elderly gentleman'. Here we report that 20% of the current Clumber and Sussex spaniel population are carriers for a null mutation in PDP1, and that homozygosity produces severe exercise intolerance. Human pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency was recently characterized at the molecular level. However, the nature of the human mutation (loss of a single amino acid altering PDP1 activity) made it impossible to discern the role of the second phosphatase isoform, PDP2, in the deficient phenotype. Here we show that the null mutation in dogs provides a valuable animal model with which to study the effects of dysregulation of the PDHc. Knowledge of the molecular defect has allowed for the institution of a rapid restriction enzyme test for the canine mutation that will allow for selective breeding and has led to a suggested dietary therapy for affected dogs that has proven to be beneficial. Pharmacological and genetic therapies for PDP1 deficiency can now be investigated and the role of PDP2 can be fully characterized.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dekomien, G</author><author>Epplen, J T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exclusion of the PDE6A gene for generalised progressive retinal atrophy in 11  breeds of dog.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>135-139</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 6</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Introns</keyword><keyword>Retinitis Pigmentosa</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10782214</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2052.2000.00611.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The cyclic guanosine monophosphate specific phosphodiesterase (cGMP-specific PDE)  is a key enzyme in the phototransduction cascade of the vertebrate retina. This enzyme consists of two catalytic alpha and beta subunits, two identical inhibitory gamma subunits as well as a delta subunit. Mutations in PDE6A and the PDE6B genes lead to autosomal recessive (ar) forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in human and to the homologous disease in dogs, designated generalised progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA). We investigated the PDE6A gene in 13 gPRA-affected dog breeds including healthy animals, obligate gPRA carriers and gPRA-affected dogs. In the coding region of PDE6A only a rare sequence variation (G103A; Asp35Asn) was found in exon 1 of two healthy Tibet Terriers and one affected Cocker Spaniel. Using single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses we detected several sequence variations in eight of the PDE6A introns in different investigated breeds. Most informative for excluding the PDE6A gene as a cause for gPRA was a polymorphic microsatellite ((GT)10CG(GT)2CG(GT)12) in intron 14 and four sequence variations in intron 18 for almost all breeds investigated. The sequence variations of PDE6A did not segregate together with gPRA in 11 breeds. Since diseased animals were heterozygous for the polymorphisms, the PDE6A gene is unlikely to harbour the critical mutation causing gPRA in the following breeds: Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Entlebucher Sennenhund, Labrador Retriever. Tibet Mastiff, Dachshund (long- and wire-haired), Tibetan Terrier, Miniature Poodle. Australian Cattle Dog, Cocker Spaniel, Saarloos/Wolfshound, Sloughi.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cuddon, P</author><author>Lin, D S</author><author>Bowman, D D</author><author>Lindsay, D S</author><author>Miller, T K</author><author>Duncan, I D</author><author>deLahunta, A</author><author>Cummings, J</author><author>Suter, M</author><author>Cooper, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neospora caninum infection in English Springer Spaniel littermates.

Two of the pups, which had the earliest onset of neurologic signs, were euthanatized without further workup. However, a detailed investigation was completed on the remaining two littermates at 12 weeks of age. Both pups had progressive paraparesis for 3 to 4 weeks before presentation, with one dog developing subsequent asymmetric pelvic limb extensor rigidity. Based on results from neurologic examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, electrophysiology, and muscle/nerve biopsy, a presumptive diagnosis of protozoal polyradiculitis and polymyositis was made. Necropsy of the most severely affected pup confirmed the clinical diagnosis of inflammatory nerve root and muscle disease but no organisms were found. To increase the potential yield of organisms, the second pup was placed on immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids and euthanatized 2 weeks later. Numerous organisms were found in lesions in muscle and the central nervous system. Organisms grew in tissue culture and were isolated from the peritoneal fluid of gerbils inoculated with infected tissue. Organisms were not isolated from inoculated mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and hamsters. No parasites were seen in feces or tissues of three cats fed infected dog tissues. Serologic testing demonstrated a strong positive titer to Neospora caninum in both pups, and electron microscopy showed the characteristic morphology of this parasite.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shahar, R</author><author>Harrus, S</author><author>Yakobson, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mesenteric vein thrombosis in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>431-433</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Anastomosis, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Jejunum</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mesenteric Vascular Occlusion</keyword><keyword>Mesenteric Veins</keyword><keyword>Thrombosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9728475</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-34-5-431</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A four-year-old, male cocker spaniel was presented for vomiting and anorexia of  two days' duration.

A year after surgery, the new palpebral margin was completely functional and cosmetically acceptable. The dog's eyes appear normal and only require treatment with artificial tears.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sokolowski, J H</author><author>Stover, D G</author><author>VanRavenswaay, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal incidence of estrus and interestrous interval for bitches of seven  breeds.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>271-273</pages><volume>171</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Estrus</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Seasons</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1977</year></dates><accession-num>561046</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>For 7 breeds of bitches (Toy Poodle, Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Boston  Terrier, German Shepherd Dog, Pekingese, and Beagle), estrous activity occurred in all seasons.

Over a 3-year interval, the dog underwent 3 computed tomography (CT) and 1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. A voluminous hyperattenuating lesion with a mass effect, exhibiting weak postcontrast enhancement and associated with surrounding diffuse parenchymal hypoattenuation, was observed in the first CT examination (3 d after initial clinical signs). The second CT examination (11 d later) revealed a hypoattenuating lesion with ring postcontrast enhancement. A clear reduction of the size of the mass, which presented as hyperattenuating with a severely postcontrast-enhanced center, was noted in the third CT examination (2.5 y after initial clinical signs and 3 mo after onset of seizures). The MRI examination, performed 3 mo after the third CT examination, showed a small lesion, T2*-gradient echo hypointense, with no peripheral halo noted in T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and with serpentiform enhancement from within the lesion to the meningeal region. These sequential imaging findings were consistent with intracerebral hemorrhage. Key clinical message: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of hyperthermia associated with intracerebral hemorrhage in a dog, although this is a common finding in human medicine. An intracerebral hemorrhage should be included in the differential diagnosis of an intracerebral mass, and performing sequential imaging examinations can help clarify the diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gould, Alexandra</author><author>Garcia-Pereira, Fernando L</author><author>Gram, W Dunbar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cardiac arrest in an American Cocker Spaniel during a deep ear flush procedure.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1023-1026</pages><volume>250</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, Inner</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Arrest</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media</keyword><keyword>Resuscitation</keyword><keyword>Sodium Chloride</keyword><keyword>Vagus Nerve</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28414607</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.250.9.1023</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION A 14-year-old spayed female American Cocker Spaniel with  bilateral otitis media and no evidence of cardiovascular instability was anesthetized to allow performance of a deep ear flush. CLINICAL FINDINGS Otoscopic examination of the left ear revealed evidence of chronic inflammation; the ear was flushed with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Examination of the right ear revealed more severe chronic inflammation than in the left ear, including a ruptured tympanum (timing of rupture unknown). The right ear was flushed with sterile saline solution, and several drops of otic medication were instilled. During infusion of saline solution, the ECG revealed a rapid decrease in heart rate until no more electrical activity was noted. Pulse also ceased to be detectable via pulse oximetry and femoral artery palpation. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Isoflurane was discontinued immediately after recognition of cardiac arrest. Shortly after, atropine (0.04 mg/kg [0.02 mg/lb]) and epinephrine (0.3 mg/kg [0.14 mg/lb]) were administered IV, chest compressions and ventilation were performed for 2 to 3 minutes, and 3 boluses (each 5 mL/kg) of lactated Ringer solution were administered IV. The dog was extubated 8 minutes after anesthesia was discontinued, and its recovery was monitored for the next 5 hours. No further incidents of cardiac arrest occurred after recovery from anesthesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This case represented a rarely documented potential complication associated with otic manipulation in a dog: cardiac arrest secondary to stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Veterinarians should be prepared for and warn clients of this possibility prior to otic flushing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Lynette K</author><author>Samii, Valerie F</author><author>Wagner, Susan O</author><author>Rajala-Schultz, Päivi J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnosis of primary secretory otitis media in the cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>459-66, e106-7</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Acoustic Impedance Tests</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media</keyword><keyword>Otoscopy</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26265219</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vde.12248</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) is a disease reported in the  cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). The diagnosis of PSOM has been made based only on visualization of a bulging tympanic membrane and mucus in the middle ear post-myringotomy. No additional tests have been evaluated for the diagnosis of PSOM; CKCSs with early disease may have been missed. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare otoscopy, tympanometry, pneumotoscopy and tympanic bulla ultrasonography, using computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard for the diagnosis of PSOM in the CKCS. ANIMALS: Sixty CKCSs with clinical signs suggestive of PSOM. METHODS: Otoscopy, CT scan, tympanic bulla ultrasonography, tympanometry and pneumotoscopy were performed; those CKCSs with a soft tissue density in the middle ear identified on CT had a myringotomy and middle ear flush. RESULTS: Forty-three (72%) CKCSs had PSOM (30 bilateral, 13 unilateral). A large bulging pars flaccida was identified in only those CKCS with PSOM (specificity of 100%); however, only 21 of 73 ears with PSOM had a large bulging pars flaccida (sensitivity of 29%). Sensitivity and specificity for tympanometry, pneumotoscopy and tympanic bulla ultrasonography were (84%, 47%), (75%, 79%) and (67%, 47%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Based on these results a large bulging pars flaccida indicates the presence of PSOM, whereas a flat pars flaccida may be present in CKCS that have PSOM as well as those that do not. In CKCSs with a flat pars flaccida none of the above diagnostic tests can be recommended in place of CT scan for the diagnosis of PSOM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Béraud, Romain</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surgical management of 2 different presentations of ear canal atresia in dogs.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>412-418</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Anastomosis, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Curettage</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear Canal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23024390</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6-year-old French spaniel and a 14-month-old German shepherd dog were diagnosed  with ear canal atresia.

These images are static and the positioning of the dogs' head does not reflect the physiological in vivo position of the craniocervical junction (CCJ). Aberrant motion patterns and ranges of motion (ROM) in sound individuals of CCJA predisposed breeds may be a pathogenetic trigger. To further extend our limited knowledge of physiological motion of the CCJ, this prospective, comparative study investigates the in vivo motion patterns and ROM of the CCJ in walk and trot in sound Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Chihuahuas. The Labrador retriever is used as a reference breed without predisposition for CCJA. This is the first detailed description of CCJ movement of trotting dogs. Biplanar fluoroscopy images, recorded in walking and trotting dogs, were matched to a virtual reconstruction of the skull and cranial cervical spine utilising Scientific Rotoscoping. Kinematic data reveal the same motion patterns among all breeds and gaits with individual temporal and spatial differences in each dog. A stride cycle-dependent lateral rotation of the cranial cervical spine and axial rotation of the atlantoaxial joint in trot in dogs is described for the first time. The ROM of the atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital joints in walk and trot were not statistically significantly greater in the CCJA-predisposed breeds CKCS and Chihuahua. ROM values of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom were larger in walk than trot, although this is only statistically significant for the atlantoaxial joint. Until proven otherwise, a more species-specific than breed-specific general motion pattern of the CCJ in walking and trotting, clinically sound dogs must be assumed. Species-specific anatomic properties of the CCJ seem to supersede breed-specific anatomical differences in clinically sound dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weber, Sarah M</author><author>Hostnik, Eric T</author><author>Drost, Wm Tod</author><author>Hamlin, Alessandra N</author><author>Ledesma, Marc A</author><author>Timperman, Lauren</author><author>Hechler, Ashley C</author><author>Cole, Lynette K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of high-field MRI and multidetector CT for grading Chiari-like  malformation and syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>444-452</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Encephalocele</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Multidetector Computed Tomography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32329949</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.12862</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) are common illnesses that  can cause debilitating neuropathic pain in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). The current imaging modality to screen CKCS for CM/SM is MRI of the brain and cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging provides good soft tissue detail and contrast of the cerebellum and cervical spinal cord. Computed tomography (CT) is another cross-sectional imaging technique that facilitates brain and neck evaluation; however, soft tissue resolution does not match that of MRI. Computed tomography benefits include identification of concurrent craniocervical junction anomalies (atlantooccipital overlap) and shorter imaging/anesthesia times with the ability to use only sedation. The aim of this retrospective, method comparison study is to assess the utility of multidetector CT for screening CM and SM in CKCS as compared to high-field MRI. Three groups of observers with different levels of experience graded CM and SM based on the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club CM/SM classification criteria. Thirty CKCS underwent multidetector CT and 3 Tesla MRI studies. Computed tomography and MRI studies were reviewed at different timepoints to minimize bias. Computed tomography has lower Cohen's Kappa agreement for each observer group compared to MRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient averaging CM and SM for all groups was excellent using MRI, while CT was poor for SM and moderate for cerebellar herniation. Greater observer experience resulted in a higher agreement for CT and MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging should remain the standard for screening of CM and SM as CT can result in misclassification and greater disagreement.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shaw, Thomas A</author><author>McGonnell, Imelda M</author><author>Driver, Colin J</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>Volk, Holger A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increase in cerebellar volume in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like  malformation and its role in the development of syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e33660</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22506005</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0033660</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Previous research in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) has found that  Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia (CM/SM) are associated with a volume mismatch between the caudal cranial fossa (CCF) and the brain parenchyma contained within. The objectives of this study were to i) compare cerebellar volume in CKCS (a &quot;high risk' group which frequently develops CM/SM), small breed dogs (medium risk--occasionally develop CM/SM), and Labradors (low risk--CM/SM not reported); ii) evaluate a possible association between increased cerebellar volume and CM/SM in CKCS; iii) investigate the relationship between increased cerebellar volume and crowding of the cerebellum in the caudal part of the CCF (i.e. the region of the foramen magnum). Volumes of three-dimensional, magnetic resonance imaging derived models of the CCF and cerebellum were obtained from 75 CKCS, 44 small breed dogs, and 31 Labradors. As SM is thought to be a late onset disease process, two subgroups were formed for comparison: 18 CKCS younger than 2 years with SM (CM/SM group) and 13 CKCS older than 5 years without SM (CM group). Relative cerebellar volume was defined as the volume of the cerebellum divided by the total volume of brain parenchyma. Our results show that the CKCS has a relatively larger cerebellum than small breed dogs and Labradors and provide evidence that increased cerebellar volume in CKCS is associated with crowding of cerebellum in the caudal part of the CCF. In CKCS there is an association between increased cerebellar volume and SM. These findings have implications for the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of CM/SM, and support the hypothesis that it is a multifactorial disease process governed by increased cerebellar volume and failure of the CCF to reach a commensurate size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McLellan, Gillian J</author><author>Bedford, Peter G C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oral vitamin E absorption in English Cocker Spaniels with familial vitamin E  deficiency and retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>48-56</pages><volume>15 Suppl 2</volume><keywords><keyword>Absorption</keyword><keyword>Administration, Oral</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Area Under Curve</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retinal Detachment</keyword><keyword>Vitamin E</keyword><keyword>Vitamin E Deficiency</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22831287</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2012.01049.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Retinal Pigment Epithelial Dystrophy (RPED) with neuroaxonal  degeneration in English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) is associated with systemic vitamin E deficiency in the absence of dietary insufficiency. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of ECS with RPED to absorb orally administered vitamin E and establish a basis for vitamin E supplementation in affected dogs. ANIMALS STUDIED: 8 RPED-affected ECS and five clinically normal dogs. PROCEDURES: An oral vitamin E tolerance test (OVETT) was conducted in each dog. Blood samples were obtained prior to and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 120, and 240 h following oral administration of 90 iu/kg of RRR-α-tocopherol. Plasma alpha tocopherol (αTOC) content was measured by normal phase, high-performance liquid chromatography, and indices of vitamin E absorption calculated. RESULTS: There was marked variation in OVETT results between individuals. In RPED-affected ECS, mean peak plasma αTOC concentration (17.87 ± 13.21 μg/mL), attained after administration of a large oral dose of the vitamin, was significantly lower than the mean peak plasma αTOC concentration attained in normal dogs (47.61 ± 17.17 μg/mL; P &lt; 0.005). However, the plasma concentrations achieved in 7/8 RPED-affected dogs remained within the normal reference range for plasma αTOC in vitamin E-replete dogs, for at least 12 h postdose. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E-deficient ECS with RPED are capable of absorbing orally administered vitamin E. Twice daily administration of 600-900 iu tocopherol is likely to restore plasma vitamin E concentrations to the normal range in most affected dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cremer, S E</author><author>Singletary, G E</author><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Wallace, K</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Ljungvall, I</author><author>Höglund, K</author><author>Reynolds, C A</author><author>Pizzinat, N</author><author>Oyama, M A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serotonin concentrations in platelets, plasma, mitral valve leaflet, and left  ventricular myocardial tissue in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1534-1540</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Heart Ventricles</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Serotonin</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25146933</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.12420</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Altered serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) signaling is  postulated in development and progression of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Little is known regarding platelet, plasma, valvular, or myocardial 5HT concentration ([5HT]) in affected dogs. We quantified [5HT] in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), mitral valve leaflets (MV), and left ventricular myocardium (LV). ANIMALS: Forty-five dogs comprised 4 plasma groups of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) or non-CKCS, either healthy (CON) or MMVD affected: CKCS CON (n = 12); non-CKCS CON (n = 8); CKCS MMVD (n = 14); non-CKCS MMVD (n = 11). Twenty-four dogs comprised 3 tissue groups: MMVD (n = 8); other-HD (heart disease) (n = 7); non-HD, extracardiac disease (n = 9). METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography measured PRP, PPP, MV, and LV [5HT]. RESULTS: Platelet-rich plasma platelet [5HT] was greater in CKCS CON (1.83 femtograms/platelet [fg/plt]; range, 0.20-4.76; P = .002), CKCS MMVD (1.58 fg/plt; range, 0.70-4.03; P = .005), and non-CKCS MMVD (1.72 fg/plt; range, 0.85-4.44; P = .003) versus non-CKCS CON (0.92 fg/plt; range, 0.63-1.30). There was no group difference in PPP [5HT]. MV [5HT] was significantly higher in MMVD (32.4 ng/mg; range, 8.4-106.7) versus non-HD (3.6 ng/mg; range, 0-28.3; P = .01) and LV [5HT] was significantly higher in MMVD (11.9 ng/mg; range, 4.0-104.8) versus other-HD (0.9 ng/mg; range, 0-10.1; P = .011) and non-HD (2.5 ng/mg; range, 0-6.9; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Platelet [5HT] was highest in healthy CKCS and both MMVD groups, but plasma [5HT] showed no group differences. Tissue [5HT] was highest in MV and LV of MMVD-affected dogs, suggesting altered 5HT signaling as a potential feature of MMVD. Interactions of platelet, valvular, and myocardial 5HT signaling warrant further investigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burrough, Eric</author><author>Deitz, Krysta</author><author>Kinyon, Joann</author><author>Andreasen, Claire</author><author>Frana, Timothy</author><author>Sutton, Deanna</author><author>Thompson, Elizabeth</author><author>Fu, Jianmin</author><author>Wickes, Brian</author><author>Hostetter, Jesse</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disseminated aspergillosis in a dog due to Aspergillus alabamensis.</title><secondary-title>Medical mycology case reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical mycology case reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-4</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>24371723</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mmcr.2012.02.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Disseminated aspergillosis is uncommon in dogs and often associated with  Aspergillus terreus.

Epidural venous distention  during raised intrathoracic pressure (Valsalva) may cause impulsive movement of fluid (&quot;slosh&quot;) within the syrinx. Such a slosh mechanism is a proposed cause of syrinx dissection into spinal cord parenchyma resulting in craniocaudal propagation of the cavity. We sought to test the &quot;slosh&quot; hypothesis by epidural excitation of CSF pulse in a computer model of canine syringomyelia. Our previously developed canine syringomyelia computer model was modified to include an epidural pressure pulse. Simulations were run for: cord free of cavities; cord with small syringes at different locations; and cord with a syrinx that was progressively expanding caudally. If small syringes are present, there are peaks of stress at those locations. This effect is most pronounced at the locations at which syringes initially form. When a syrinx is expanding caudally, the peak stress is typically at the caudal end of the syrinx. However, when the syrinx reaches the lumbar region; the stress becomes moderate. The findings support the &quot;slosh&quot; hypothesis, suggesting that small cervical syringes may propagate caudally. However, when the syrinx is large, there is less focal stress, which may explain why a syrinx can rapidly expand but then remain unchanged in shape over years.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baker, J L</author><author>Craig, T M</author><author>Barton, C L</author><author>Scott, D W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatozoon canis in a dog with oral pyogranulomas and neurologic disease.</title><secondary-title>The Cornell veterinarian</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cornell veterinarian</full-title></periodical><pages>179-183</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apicomplexa</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Granuloma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mouth Diseases</keyword><keyword>Protozoan Infections, Animal</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>3131065</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A ten-month-old Cocker Spaniel presented for fever, difficulty walking, and oral  lesions.

They are also some of the more frustrating entities practitioners are called on to deal with. Successful management depends on an understanding of the primary, predisposing, and perpetuating factors involved in the pathogenesis of otitis externa. Emphasis is then placed on establishing a diagnosis through physical examination, cytologic examination, culture and sensitivity testing, radiographs and biopsies. The general goals of management are to resolve, remove, or control primary factors, clean and dry the ear, reduce inflammation and resolve secondary infections. These goals are achieved through various cleaning techniques, topical, and systemic therapies. Therapeutic alternatives are given for otitis involving bacteria, Malassezia, otodectes, demodex, allergies, ceruminous disorders, the idiopathic inflammatory/hyperplastic otitis externa of cocker spaniels, &quot;Swimmer's Ear&quot;, contact/irritant reactions, overtreatment, and concurrent otitis media.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jimenez Castro, Pablo D</author><author>Durrence, Kendra</author><author>Durrence, Stephen</author><author>Gianechini, Leonor Sicalo</author><author>Collins, James</author><author>Dunn, Kayla</author><author>Kaplan, Ray M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple anthelmintic drug resistance in hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum) in a  Labrador breeding and training kennel in Georgia, USA.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>342-347</pages><volume>261</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Ancylostoma</keyword><keyword>Ancylostomatoidea</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anthelmintics</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance</keyword><keyword>Feces</keyword><keyword>Fenbendazole</keyword><keyword>Georgia</keyword><keyword>Macrolides</keyword><keyword>Parasite Egg Count</keyword><keyword>Praziquantel</keyword><keyword>Pyrantel Pamoate</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36520649</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.22.08.0377</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the 3 major classes of anthelmintics used  for the treatment of hookworms in dogs in the US and an extralabel treatment with an FDA-approved product for use in cats in a Labrador kennel with a history of persistent hookworm infections. ANIMALS: 22 dogs housed in a single kennel comprised of the following breeds: 19 Labrador Retrievers, 1 English Cocker Spaniel, 1 Chesapeake Bay Retriever, and 1 Boykin Spaniel. PROCEDURES: We performed a fecal egg count (FEC) reduction test using 22 dogs that were allocated randomly to 1 of 5 treatment groups: pyrantel pamoate (Pyrantel pamoate suspension), fenbendazole (Safe-Guard suspension 10%), milbemycin oxime (Interceptor), moxidectin plus imidacloprid (Advantage Multi), and emodepside plus praziquantel (Profender topical solution for cats). FEC was performed on samples collected on days 0 and 11. RESULTS: FEC reductions for the milbemycin oxime, moxidectin plus imidacloprid, and emodepside plus praziquantel groups were 43.9%, 57.4%, and 100%, respectively. The FEC increased following treatment for the pyrantel and fenbendazole groups. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data demonstrate that the Ancylostoma caninum infecting the dogs in this kennel are highly resistant to all major anthelmintic classes approved for use in dogs in the US but are susceptible to emodepside. This was the first report of multiple anthelmintic drug-resistant A caninum in a dog kennel that does not involve Greyhounds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Decker, Steven</author><author>Watts, Vicky</author><author>Neilson, David M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic Lumbosacral Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Dog with Tethered Cord  Syndrome with a Tight Filum Terminale.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>134</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28868301</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2017.00134</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 1-year and 11-month- old English Cocker Spaniel was evaluated for clinical  signs of progressive right pelvic limb lameness and urinary incontinence. Neurological examination was suggestive of a lesion localized to the L4-S3 spinal cord segments. No abnormalities were seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the dog in dorsal recumbency and the hips in a neutral position and the conus medullaris ended halfway the vertebral body of L7. An MRI of the hips in extended and flexed positions demonstrated minimal displacement of the conus medullaris in the cranial and caudal directions, respectively. Similar to the images in neutral position, the conus medullaris ended halfway the vertebral body of L7 in both the extended and flexed positions. In comparison, an MRI of the hips in neutral, extended, and flexed positions performed in another English Cocker Spaniel revealed obvious cranial displacement of the conus medullaris with the hips in extension and caudal displacement with hips in flexion. A standard dorsal lumbosacral laminectomy was performed. Visual inspection of the vertebral canal revealed excessive caudal traction on the conus medullaris. After sectioning the distal aspect of the filum terminale, the conus medullaris regained a more cranial position. A neurological examination 4 weeks after surgery revealed clinical improvement. Neurological examinations at 2, 4, 7, and 12 months after surgery did not reveal any abnormalities, and the dog was considered to be clinically normal. Tethered cord syndrome with a tight filum terminale is a very rare congenital anomaly and is characterized by an abnormally short and inelastic filum terminale. Therefore, this disorder is associated with abnormal caudal traction on the spinal cord and decreased physiological craniocaudal movements of the neural structures within the vertebral canal. Although further studies are necessary to evaluate and quantify physiological craniocaudal movement of the spinal cord and conus medullaris in neurologically normal dogs, the results of this report suggest further exploration of dynamic MRI to demonstrate decreased craniocaudal displacement of the conus medullaris in dogs with tethered cord syndrome with a tight filum terminale.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webb, A A</author><author>Taylor, S M</author><author>McPhee, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Focal myasthenia gravis in a dog.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>493-495</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autoantibodies</keyword><keyword>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Esophageal Achalasia</keyword><keyword>Hypothyroidism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Myasthenia Gravis</keyword><keyword>Neostigmine</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Cholinergic</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9262858</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 10-month-old American cocker spaniel was evaluated for megaesophagus,  aspiration pneumonia, but no appendicular muscle weakness.

MVD has different severity levels, and there are many practical limitations in identifying its asymptomatic stages. Proteomic techniques are valuable for studying the proteins and peptides involved in cardiovascular diseases, including the period prior to the clinical onset of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify the serum proteins that were differentially expressed in healthy CKCS and those affected by MVD in mild to severe stages. Proteomics analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation and a bioinformatics analysis for the detection of differentially expressed spots. In a comparative analysis, protein spots with a p &lt; 0.05 (ANOVA) were considered statistically significant and were excised from the gels for analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS for protein identification. RESULTS: Eight proteins resulted differentially expressed among the groups and significantly related to the progression of the disease. In mild affected group versus healthy dogs complement factor H isoform 2, inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, hemopexin, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7 and CD5 molecule-like resulted to be down-regulated, whereas fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 3A isoform X4 was up-regulated. In severe affected dogs versus healthy group complement factor H isoform 2, calpain-3 isoform X2, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7, CD5 molecule-like and l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase resulted to be down-regulated. Complement factor H isoform 2, calpain-3 isoform X2, dystrobrevin beta isoform X7, CD5 molecule-like and hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase were found to be down-regulated in mild affected group versus healthy dogs. All of these proteins except complement factor H followed a decreasing trend according to the progression of the pathology. CONCLUSION: The differential expression of serum proteins demonstrates the possibility these might be valuable for the detection and monitoring of the disease. Further longitudinal studies are required to determine whether differential protein expression occurs sufficiently early in the progression of the disease and with sufficient predictive value to allow proteomics analysis to be used as an early detection and on-line diagnostic tool.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McAtee, Brigitte B</author><author>Heseltine, Johanna C</author><author>Guo, Ling T</author><author>Willard, Michael D</author><author>Shelton, G Diane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dysphagia and esophageal dysfunction due to dystrophin deficient muscular  dystrophy in a male Spanish water spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The veterinary quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The veterinary quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>28-32</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Autopsy</keyword><keyword>Deglutition Disorders</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Esophageal Motility Disorders</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscular Dystrophy, Animal</keyword><keyword>Schools, Veterinary</keyword><keyword>Texas</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29384432</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01652176.2018.1435939</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cahalan, S D</author><author>Hick, G</author><author>Rossiter, A</author><author>Callanan, J J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fatal Prevotella oralis meningitis.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>153-155</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacteroidaceae Infections</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Meningitis, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Prevotella</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23190147</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2012.01311.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Prevotella oralis, an obligate Gram-negative anaerobe, was detected as the cause  of acute meningitis in a four-year-old cocker spaniel.

The absence of any material in the cystic spaces and the spectrum of intraocular degenerative changes indicated that the retinal change was a secondary retinoschisis, probably due to retinal detachment. Separation of retinal layers without disruption of the blood supply probably plays a part in the aetiology of retinoschisis. The pathogenesis and natural history of intraretinal cystic changes and retinoschisis in animals are poorly understood.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arora, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reversed patent ductus arteriosus in a dog.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>471-472</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11424581</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 5-year-old cocker spaniel with tachycardia, &gt; 2 s capillary refill time,  arrhythmia, split S2 heart sound, right ventricular enlargement, flattened interventricular septum, dilated pulmonary artery, and slight tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed with reversed patent ductus arteriosus (right-to-left vs the more common left-to-right shunt).

Pulmonary embolization of the device is a rarely reported complication of this procedure. We report here the first two cases of successful transcatheter retrieval of an embolized ACDO. An 8-month-old, 21-kg, German shepherd (case 1) was referred for pulmonary edema secondary to a large PDA with left-to-right shunting. After medical stabilization, an emergency procedure for PDA closure was recommended. An 8-mm ACDO was deployed under general anesthesia. The device was released after confirming its stability with a gentle tug test but migrated into the pulmonary trunk. A 10-mm ACDO was subsequently successfully deployed and released. Vascular access was then obtained from the right jugular vein so that a vascular snare could be used to capture the ACDO waist and pull it back toward the right ventricle and then the right atrium. It was then removed through the jugular vein. The dog recovered uneventfully and was discharged after confirmation of complete ductal occlusion. The same complication occurred in a second case (case 2, asymptomatic 6-month-old, 7.9-kg, cocker spaniel), and a similar procedure was used to successfully retrieve the embolized device. Both dogs are still doing well 9 and 21 months, respectively, after the procedure. These cases illustrate that transcatheter retrieval of ACDO devices embolized in the pulmonary artery using vascular snares is technically feasible in the dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spildrejorde, Mari</author><author>Bartlett, Rachael</author><author>Stokes, Leanne</author><author>Jalilian, Iman</author><author>Peranec, Michelle</author><author>Sluyter, Vanessa</author><author>Curtis, Belinda L</author><author>Skarratt, Kristen K</author><author>Skora, Amanda</author><author>Bakhsh, Tahani</author><author>Seavers, Aine</author><author>McArthur, Jason D</author><author>Dowton, Mark</author><author>Sluyter, Ronald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>R270C polymorphism leads to loss of function of the canine P2X7 receptor.</title><secondary-title>Physiological genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physiological genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>512-522</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Heterozygote</keyword><keyword>Homozygote</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells</keyword><keyword>Monocytes</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Purinergic P2X7</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24824213</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/physiolgenomics.00195.2013</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The relative function of the P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel, varies  between humans due to polymorphisms in the P2RX7 gene. This study aimed to assess the functional impact of P2X7 variation in a random sample of the canine population. Blood and genomic DNA were obtained from 69 dogs selected as representatives of a cross section of different breeds. P2X7 function was determined by flow cytometric measurements of dye uptake and patch-clamp measurements of inward currents. P2X7 expression was determined by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Sequencing was used to identify P2RX7 gene polymorphisms. P2X7 was cloned from an English springer spaniel, and point mutations were introduced into this receptor by site-directed mutagenesis. The relative function of P2X7 on monocytes varied between individual dogs. The canine P2RX7 gene encoded four missense polymorphisms: F103L and P452S, found in heterozygous and homozygous dosage, and R270C and R365Q, found only in heterozygous dosage. Moreover, R270C and R365Q were associated with the cocker spaniel and Labrador retriever, respectively. F103L, R270C, and R365Q but not P452S corresponded to decreased P2X7 function in monocytes but did not explain the majority of differences in P2X7 function between dogs, indicating that other factors contribute to this variability. Heterologous expression of site-directed mutants of P2X7 in human embryonic kidney-293 cells indicated that the R270C mutant was nonfunctional, the F103L and R365Q mutants had partly reduced function, and the P452S mutant functioned normally. Taken together, these data highlight that a R270C polymorphism has major functional impact on canine P2X7.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clerbaux, T</author><author>Gustin, P</author><author>Detry, B</author><author>Cao, M L</author><author>Frans, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative study of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve of four mammals: man,  dog, horse and cattle.</title><secondary-title>Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

The entire oxygen dissociation curve (ODC) and the effects of temperature, pH  and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) on this curve, have been compared in four mammalians: man, dog, horse and cattle. 2. If the oxyphoric capacities are similar between these species (around 1.39 ml O2/gHb), their P50, measured in standard conditions, i.e. at pH 7.4; pCO2 40 mmHg and T 37 degrees C, varies between 23.8 (+/- 0.8) mmHg for the horse, 25.0 (+/- 1.4) mmHg for cattle, 26.6 (+/- 1.2) for man and 28.8 (+/- 2.6) mmHg for the dog. 3. The higher dispersion of the dog's P 50 is due to difference between breeds; in seven breeds investigated, the P 50 ranges from 25.8 (spaniel) to 35.8 (hound). 4. We noted no sex difference in the four species. 5. The DPG level is confirmed to be low in cattle (&lt; 1 mumol/gHb) as compared to man (13.5 +/- 2.1 mumol/gHb), horse (16.9 +/- 1.1 mumol/gHb) and dog (19.4 +/- 2.8 mumol/gHb). 6. The oxygen exchange fraction defined as the difference in vol% between a pO2 of 80 and 35 mmHg is, respectively, 3.6 (+/- 0.6) vol% for cattle, 4.0 (+/- 0.4) vol% for the horse, 5.5 (+/- 0.5) vol% for man and 6.6 (+/- 1.7) vol% for the dog. 7. The position and shape of the ODC, as well as T, DPG and pH effects, indicate that the haemoglobin of man and dog seem better adapted to O2 delivery as compared to the horse and cattle.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, C-C</author><author>Liu, M-M</author><author>Culshaw, G</author><author>Clinton, M</author><author>Argyle, D J</author><author>Corcoran, B M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene network and canonical pathway analysis in canine myxomatous mitral valve  disease: a microarray study.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>23-31</pages><volume>204</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Transcriptome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25841900</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2015.02.021</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the single most common acquired heart  disease of the dog and is particularly common in small pedigree breed dogs such as the Cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS). There are limited data on the mitral valve transcriptome and the aim of this study was to use the microarray technology in conjunction with bioinformatics platforms to analyse transcript changes in MMVD in CKCS compared to normal dogs (non-CKCS). Differentially expressed genes (n = 5397) were identified using cut-off settings of fold change, false discovery rate (FDR) and P &lt;0.05. In total, 4002 genes were annotated to a specific transcript in the Affymetrix canine database, and after further filtering, 591 annotated canine genes were identified: 322 (55%) were up-regulated and 269 (45%) were down-regulated. Canine microRNAs (cfa-miR; n = 59) were also identified. Gene ontology and network analysis platforms identified between six and 10 significantly different biological function clusters from which the following were selected as relevant to MMVD: inflammation, cell movement, cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix organisation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified three canonical pathways relevant to MMVD: caveolar-mediated endocytosis, remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions, and endothelin-1 signalling. Considering the biological relevance to MMVD, the gene families of importance with significant difference between groups included collagens, ADAMTS peptidases, proteoglycans, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, basement membrane components, cathepsin S, integrins, tight junction cell adhesion proteins, cadherins, other matrix-associated proteins, and members of the serotonin (5-HT)/transforming growth factor -β signalling pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Brien, M J</author><author>Beijerink, N J</author><author>Wade, C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetics of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>409-421</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Disease Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34028063</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/age.13082</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease and cause  of cardiac death in domestic dogs. MMVD is characterised by slow progressive myxomatous degeneration from the tips of the mitral valves onwards with subsequent mitral valve regurgitation, and left atrial and ventricular dilatation. Although the disease usually has a long asymptomatic period, in dogs with severe disease, mortality is typically secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure. Although it is not uncommon for dogs to survive long enough in the asymptomatic period to die from unrelated causes; a proportion of dogs rapidly advance into congestive heart failure. Heightened prevalence in certain breeds, such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, has indicated that MMVD is under a genetic influence. The genetic characterisation of the factors that underlie the difference in progression of disease is of strong interest to those concerned with dog longevity and welfare. Advanced genomic technologies have the potential to provide information that may impact treatment, prevalence, or severity of MMVD through the elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms and the detection of predisposing genetic loci of major effect. Here we describe briefly the clinical nature of the disorder and consider the physiological mechanisms that might impact its occurrence in the domestic dog. Using results from comparative genomics we suggest possible genetic approaches for identifying genetic risk factors within breeds. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed represents a robust resource for uncovering the genetic basis of MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reddy, Bhaskar</author><author>Kelawala, Divyesh N</author><author>Shah, Tejas</author><author>Patel, Anand B</author><author>Patil, Deepak B</author><author>Parikh, Pinesh V</author><author>Patel, Namrata</author><author>Parmar, Nidhi</author><author>Mohapatra, Amit B</author><author>Singh, Krishna M</author><author>Menon, Ramesh</author><author>Pandya, Dipal</author><author>Jakhesara, Subhash J</author><author>Koringa, Prakash G</author><author>Rao, Mandava V</author><author>Joshi, Chaitanya G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of putative SNPs in progressive retinal atrophy affected Canis  lupus familiaris using exome sequencing.</title><secondary-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</full-title></periodical><pages>638-649</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>11-12</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Conserved Sequence</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Annotation</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutation, Missense</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26515695</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00335-015-9607-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is one of the major causes of retinal  photoreceptor cell degeneration in canines. The inheritance pattern of PRA is autosomal recessive and genetically heterogeneous. Here, using targeted sequencing technology, we have performed exome sequencing of 10 PRA-affected (Spitz=7, Cocker Spaniel=1, Lhasa Aphso=1 and Spitz-Labrador cross breed=1) and 6 normal (Spitz=5, Cocker Spaniel=1) dogs. The high-throughput sequencing using 454-Roche Titanium sequencer generated about 2.16 Giga bases of raw data. Initially, we have successfully identified 25,619 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed the stringent SNP calling parameters. Further, we performed association study on the cohort, and the highly significant (0.001) associations were short-listed and investigated in-depth. Out of the 171 significant SNPs, 113 were previously unreported. Interestingly, six among them were non-synonymous coding (NSC) SNPs, which includes CPPED1 A&gt;G (p.M307V), PITRM1 T&gt;G (p.S715A), APP G&gt;A (p.T266M), RNF213 A&gt;G (p.V1482A), C&gt;A (p.V1456L), and SLC46A3 G&gt;A (p.R168Q). On the other hand, 35 out of 113 unreported SNPs were falling in regulatory regions such as 3'-UTR, 5'-UTR, etc. In-depth bioinformatics analysis revealed that majority of NSC SNPs have damaging effect and alter protein stability. This study highlighted the genetic markers associated with PRA, which will help to develop genetic assay-based screening in effective breeding.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gelatt, Kirk N</author><author>MacKay, Edward O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secondary glaucomas in the dog in North America.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>245-259</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Lens Subluxation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15200621</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2004.04034.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of secondary glaucomas in dogs associated  with cataract formation, lens luxation or displacement, cataract surgery, uveitis, hyphema and intraocular neoplasia. METHODS: Information was obtained from the Veterinary Medical Data Base (VMDB) from all veterinary medical teaching hospitals in North America from March 1964 to March 2003. Secondary glaucomas were diagnosed at the same examination or after the primary diagnosis was made, and included those associated with cataract formation, lens luxation, cataract surgery, uveitis of unknown cause, hyphema of unknown cause, and intraocular neoplasia. The data were evaluated by decade, breed, gender and age of presentation. RESULTS: A total of 1 592 831 dogs were presented, and 9695 canine secondary glaucomas. Secondary glaucoma associated with cataract formation represented 81% of all the canine secondary glaucomas. Breeds (n = 7890 dogs) predisposed to secondary glaucoma and cataracts had an overall prevalence of 0.5%, but nearly 20% of all the cataractous dogs developed secondary glaucoma in at least one eye. For the years 1994-2003, these breeds included the American Cocker Spaniel; Boston Terrier; Toy, Miniature and Standard Poodle; English Springer Spaniel; Bichon Frise; and Labrador Retriever. The other forms of secondary glaucoma occurred less frequently, and included those glaucomas with lens luxation or displacement (779 dogs; 12.0%), postcataract surgery (528 dogs; 5.1%), with uveitis from unknown cause (399 dogs; 7.1%), with hyphema from unknown cause (117 dogs; 7.3%), and with intraocular neoplasia (19 dogs; 3.5%). The risk of the secondary glaucomas from 1984 to 2002 was highest after the intracapsular lens extraction (ICLE), less in the extracapsular technique (ECLE), and lowest for the phacoemulsification/phacofragmentation method. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of the canine secondary glaucomas ranges from 0.25% (1964-1973), 0.46% (1974-1983), 0.79% (1984-1993), to 0.80% (1994-2003) and are as frequent as the primary or breed-related glaucomas during these same time periods.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Sangwan</author><author>Casanova, M Isabel</author><author>Bannasch, Danika L</author><author>Daley, Nicole L</author><author>Kim, Soohyun</author><author>Kuchtey, John</author><author>Gomes, Filipe Espinheira</author><author>Leonard, Brian C</author><author>Good, Kathryn L</author><author>Martins, Bianca da C</author><author>Murphy, Christopher J</author><author>Thomasy, Sara M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocular morphologic traits in the American Cocker Spaniel may confer primary angle  closure glaucoma susceptibility.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>18980</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Angle-Closure</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma, Open-Angle</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intraocular Pressure</keyword><keyword>Iris</keyword><keyword>Plant Breeding</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36348026</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-022-23238-1</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Acute primary angle closure glaucoma is a potentially blinding ophthalmic  emergency requiring prompt treatment to lower the elevated intraocular pressure in humans and dogs. The PACG in most of canine breeds is epidemiologically similar to humans with older and female patients overrepresented with the condition. The American Cocker Spaniel (ACS) is among the most common breeds observed with PACG development in dogs. This study initially sought to identify genetic risk factors to explain the high prevalence of PACG in ACSs by using a case-control breed-matched genome-wide association study. However, the GWAS failed to identify candidate loci associated with PACG in this breed. This study then assessed intrinsic ocular morphologic traits that may relate to PACG susceptibility in this breed. Normal ACSs without glaucoma have a crowded anterior ocular segment and narrow iridocorneal angle and ciliary cleft, which is consistent with anatomical risk factors identified in humans. The ACSs showed unique features consisting of posterior bowing of iris and longer iridolenticular contact, which mirrors reverse pupillary block and pigment dispersion syndrome in humans. The ACS could hold potential to serve as an animal model of naturally occurring PACG in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moesgaard, S G</author><author>Klostergaard, C</author><author>Zois, N E</author><author>Teerlink, T</author><author>Molin, M</author><author>Falk, T</author><author>Rasmussen, C E</author><author>Luis Fuentes, V</author><author>Jones, I D</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Flow-mediated vasodilation measurements in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with  increasing severity of myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>61-68</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arginine</keyword><keyword>Blood Pressure</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Endothelium, Vascular</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Vasodilation</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22151409</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00846.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is associated with endothelial dysfunction in  humans and studies of plasma biomarkers suggest that dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) might also have endothelial dysfunction. HYPOTHESIS: That progression of mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with development of endothelial dysfunction. ANIMALS: Forty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with MR of varying severity. METHODS: Privately owned CKCS were prospectively recruited and divided in 4 groups: (1) 12 CKCS with minimal MR; (2) 9 CKCS with mild MR; (3) 11 CKCS with moderate-severe MR; and (4) 11 CKCS with moderate-severe MR and clinical signs compatible with heart failure. Dogs underwent blood sampling, echocardiography, blood pressure (BP) recordings, and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) measurements. The effect of progressive MR on FMD was determined by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased with progression of MR. Group 4 (4.79 ± 3.22%) had significantly lower FMD than groups 1 (10.40 ± 4.58%) and 2 (10.14 ± 3.67%) (P &lt; .005) and group 3 (6.79 ± 3.98%) had a significantly lower FMD than group 1 (P = .03). Increasing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P = .0004, R(2) = 0.27) and the combination of age (P = .01) and body weight (P = .002) (R(2) = 0.31) were significantly associated with reduced FMD. FMD did not correlate with sex, BP, or plasma markers. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Reduced FMD indicates that increased disease severity in CKCS with MMVD is associated with development of endothelial dysfunction which might be a future therapeutic and/or diagnostic target.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lord, P F</author><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Carnabuci, C</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Häggström, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Radiographic heart size and its rate of increase as tests for onset of congestive  heart failure in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with mitral valve regurgitation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1312-1319</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Myocardium</keyword><keyword>Organ Size</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22092622</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00792.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: In canine mitral regurgitation (MR) the rate of heart enlargement  increases in the last year before congestive heart failure (CHF). Measurement of heart size and its rate of increase may be useful tests for CHF in MR. OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of vertebral heart scale (VHS) and its rate of increase (∆VHS units/month) for diagnosing the presence and predicting the onset of CHF. ANIMALS: Longitudinal study of 94 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). METHODS: VHS was measured at intervals before CHF. ∆VHS/month was calculated from sequential pairs of VHS measurements and the interval between them. Diagnostic accuracy and utility were determined by the areas under receiver operating characteristic plots (AUROC), and likelihood ratios (LR). RESULTS: AUROC for VHS at the onset of CHF was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.96-0.90), to predict CHF 1-12 months before CHF was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.81-0.66), and for ∆VHS/month at CHF was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.99-0.96). Interval LRs and their cutoff values for CHF were for VHS: 13 (95% CI, 20-7.3) at ≥12.7; 1.2 (95% CI, 2.0-0.68) between 12.7 and 12.0; 0.04 (95% CI, 0.18-0.01) at ≤12.0, and for ∆VHS/month: 15 (95% CI, 30-7.7) at ≥0.08; 0.72 (95% CI, 2.0-0.25) between 0.08 and 0.06; and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.13-0.02) at ≤0.06.

Abnormal valvular stress is thought to contribute to the development and progression of MMVD, and a relationship exists between mitral valve (MV) morphology and stress acting on the valve. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the MV morphology of healthy adult CKCSs differs from the morphology of healthy adult dogs of other breeds determined by RT-3DTTE. ANIMALS: Thirty-five healthy CKCSs and 41 healthy dogs of other breeds. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study. Dogs underwent physical examination, conventional echocardiography, and RT-3DTTE. RT-3DTTE datasets were analyzed using dedicated software for MV morphologic analysis. Morphologic variables were compared between CKCSs and dogs of other breeds. RESULTS: The MV of healthy CKCSs had a smaller annulus height (0.46 ± 0.11 vs. 0.56 ± 0.17; P = .0021), tenting height (0.26 ± 0.12 vs. 0.42 ± 0.18; P &lt; .001), tenting area (0.42 ± 0.15 vs. 0.79 ± 0.34; P &lt; .001), normalized tenting volume (0.09 [0.05-0.13] vs. 0.14 [0.10-0.20]; P &lt; .001), and normalized area of the posterior leaflet (0.57 ± 0.15 vs. 0.66 ± 0.18; P = .016) compared to healthy dogs of other breeds; this results in CKCSs having a flatter MV with reduced tenting, compared to the MV of other breeds. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These morphologic features could confer a mechanical disadvantage and play a role in the predisposition of CKCSs to the early development of MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Svancer, Patrik</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brain ventricular volume changes in schizophrenia.

Understanding the dynamics of brain ventricle changes could resolve long-standing questions on the proportion of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental processes in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charlesworth, T M</author><author>Dunning, M</author><author>Scase, T J</author><author>Anderson, D M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Colonic vascular ectasia (angiodysplasia) in a juvenile dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>36-39</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiodysplasia</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Colonic Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Weight Loss</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23058126</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2012.01297.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An eight-month-old female English springer spaniel was presented with weight loss  and severe haematochezia.

Compared to dogs less than 2 years of age, those 4--7 years of age were at increased risk of developing coccidioidomycosis whereas dogs 2--7 years of age were at increased risk of developing histoplasmosis. Three breeds, i.e., Pointer, Weimaraner and Brittany Spaniel, had increased risk of having histoplasmosis infections.

The framework may mitigate relapses and improve patient functioning. The methodology consists of long-term actigraphy monitoring and simplified self-assessment tool to determine manic or depression events. Eight patients were involved in the feasibility study, spanning period of 150 months, resulting in 17 relapses and 3 hospitalizations in total. We concluded that the most promising parameter extracted from actigraphy recording is a circadian rhythm's interdaily stability. Using developed trend analysis applied on interdaily stability parameter, we achieved sensitivity and specificity about 65, resp. 68. We hypothesized that this performance is both mainly due to missing values in data and due to small amount of relapses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lautzenhiser, Sarah J</author><author>Bjorling, Dale E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urinary incontinence in a dog with an ectopic ureterocele.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>29-32</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hysterectomy</keyword><keyword>Nephrectomy</keyword><keyword>Ureterocele</keyword><keyword>Urinary Incontinence</keyword><keyword>Urography</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11804312</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/0380029</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7-month-old, female English cocker spaniel was examined because of a complaint  of urinary incontinence.

Axons were either non-myelinated or surrounded by a myelin sheath that was markedly reduced in both its thickness and length of internode. Myelinated and non-myelinated zones were present on a single axon. There was no paucity of oligodendrocytes but many of those present contained empty or granular vacuoles within the cytoplasm. Features suggesting immaturity of myelination were commonly found at paranodes and along the internode. Abnormal inter-relationships of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes were present at many paranodes. These observations suggest an intrinsic defect of oligodendrocyte metabolism such that they are incapable of normal extension of their plasma membranes, while the cytoplasmic vacuoles may represent breakdown of defective lipids.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Urkasemsin, Ganokon</author><author>Olby, Natasha J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine paroxysmal movement disorders.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary clinics of North America.

The objective of this prospective reference interval study was to provide breed-specific echocardiographic values for healthy French Bulldogs. A total of 42 healthy French Bulldogs of both sexes (23 females and 19 males) were sampled. Furthermore, measurements for a control group (n = 16) were also conducted in four other dog breeds (Cocker Spaniel [n = 2], Cavalier King Charles Spaniel [n = 4], Terrier [n = 5], and Crossbreed [n = 5]). Standard M-mode, two-dimensional (2D), pulse wave (PW) Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiographic measurements were obtained from healthy French Bulldogs. The M-mode echocardiographic data obtained from French Bulldogs were compared to the data obtained from the control group. The left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole (LVIDd; cm)/body surface area (BSA) (m(2) ) ratio for the study group was 3.35/0.53 = 6.32. Left ventricular measurements for French bulldogs and internal dimension at end-systole (21.23 ± 3.50 mm) and at end-diastole (33.50 ± 4.12 mm) were found to be significantly higher (P &lt; .001) compared to control group values (left ventricular internal dimension at end-systole [LVIDs]; 17.46 ± 2.85 mm, LVIDd; 27.16 ± 4.20 mm, respectively). A significantly positive correlation in the French Bulldog group was noted between body weight and M-mode measurements (EPSS, IVSd, IVSs, LVIDd, LVIDs, and LVPWd). French bulldogs had a greater systolic and diastolic left ventricular volume than the control group. As a result, values reported in this study could be used as specific reference ranges in French Bulldogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dubey, J P</author><author>Chapman, Jennifer L</author><author>Rosenthal, Benjamin M</author><author>Mense, M</author><author>Schueler, Ronald L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical Sarcocystis neurona, Sarcocystis canis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora  caninum infections in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary parasitology</full-title></periodical><pages>36-49</pages><volume>137</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Agglutination Tests</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Protozoan</keyword><keyword>Coccidiosis</keyword><keyword>DNA, Protozoan</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron, Transmission</keyword><keyword>Neospora</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sarcocystis</keyword><keyword>Sarcocystosis</keyword><keyword>Toxoplasma</keyword><keyword>Toxoplasmosis, Animal</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16458431</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vetpar.2005.12.017</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Sarcocystis neurona, Sarcocystis canis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum  are related apicomplexans that can cause systemic illness in many species of animals, including dogs. We investigated one breeder's 25 Basset Hounds for these infections. In addition, tissues from dogs and other non-canine hosts previously reported as S. canis infections were studied retrospectively. Schizonts resembling those of S. neurona, and recognized by polyclonal rabbit anti-S. neurona antibodies, were found in six of eight retrospective cases, as well as in two additional dogs (one Basset Hound, one Springer Spaniel) not previously reported. S. neurona schizonts were found in several tissues including the central nervous system, lungs, and kidneys. Fatal toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in an adult dog, and neosporosis was diagnosed in an adult and a pup related to the one diagnosed with S. neurona. No serological reactivity to S. neurona antibodies occurred when S. canis-like liver schizonts were retrospectively assayed from two dogs, a dolphin, a sea lion, a horse, a chinchilla, a black or either of two polar bears. Sequencing conserved (18S) and variable (ITS-1) portions of nuclear ribosomal DNA isolated from the schizont-laden liver of a polar bear distinguished it from all previously characterized species of Sarcocystis. We take this genetic signature as provisionally representative of S. canis, an assumption that should be tested with future sequencing of similar liver infections in other mammalian hosts. These findings further extend the uncharacteristically broad intermediate host range for S. neurona, which also causes a neurologic disease in cats, mink, raccoons, skunks, Pacific harbor seals, ponies, zebras, lynxes, and sea otters. Further work is necessary to delineate the causative agent(s) of other cases of canine sarcocystosis, and in particular to specify the attributes of S. canis, which corresponds morphologically to infections reported from wide range of terrestrial and marine mammals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Milne, K L</author><author>Hayes, H M Jr</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiologic features of canine hypothyroidism.</title><secondary-title>The Cornell veterinarian</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cornell veterinarian</full-title></periodical><pages>3-14</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypothyroidism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Myxedema</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1981</year></dates><accession-num>7226844</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study investigates the epidemiologic features of 3,206 dogs diagnosed with  hypothyroidism (including myxedema) from 1.1 million dogs seen at 15 veterinary teaching hospitals between March, 1964 and June, 1978. Nine breeds found to be at high-risk for hypothyroidism were: golden retrievers, Doberman pinschers, dachshunds, Shetland sheepdogs, Irish setters, Pomeranians, miniature schnauzers, cocker spaniels, and Airedales. Two breed with a significant deficit of risk were German shepherds and mixed breed (mongrel) dogs. Age risk was greatest among younger dogs of high-risk breeds, further suggesting a genetic component to the etiology of this disease. In contrast, low-risk dogs had increasing relative risk through nine years of age. Spayed female dogs displayed a significantly higher risk when compared to intact females. Though not statistically significant, male castrated dogs had 30% more hypothyroidism compared to their intact counterparts. Among the case series were 91 endocrine and hormone-related neoplasms and 198 other endocrine-related disorders. Further studies linking canine hypothyroidism to other conditions, particularly cancer, could provide valuable insight into human disease experience.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, F</author><author>Vohlídka, P</author><author>Kozený, J</author><author>Novák, T</author><author>Hrdlicka, J</author><author>Motlová, L</author><author>Cermák, J</author><author>Höschl, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Information Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme in Schizophrenia:  an extension of a mirror-design follow-up.</title><secondary-title>International journal of clinical practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of clinical practice</full-title></periodical><pages>1943-1946</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Informatics</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Secondary Prevention</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18795967</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01903.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>AIMS: Decreasing a number of hospital admissions is important for improving  outcomes for people with schizophrenia. The Information Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) programme enables early pharmacological intervention in psychosis by identification of prodromal symptoms of relapse using home telemonitoring via a phone-to-PC SMS platform. METHODS: This study was a 1-year extension of a previously published mirror-design follow-up evaluation of programme clinical effectiveness. In total, 73 patients with psychotic illness (45 patients from original sample and 28 newly added subjects) collaborating with 56 family members participated in the clinical evaluation. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant 77% decrease in the number of hospitalisations during the mean 396.8 +/- 249.4 days of participation in ITAREPS, compared with the same time period before participation in ITAREPS (Wilcoxon-signed ranks test, p &lt; 0.00001), as well as significantly reduced number of hospitalisation days when in the ITAREPS (2365 hospitalisation days before and 991 days after ITAREPS enrolment respectively, Wilcoxon-signed ranks test, p &lt; 0.003). CONCLUSION: The ITAREPS programme represents an effective tool in the long-term treatment of patients with psychotic disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Bakstein, Eduard</author><author>Anyz, Jiri</author><author>Hlinka, Jaroslav</author><author>Sieger, Tomas</author><author>Hrdlicka, Jan</author><author>Görnerová, Natálie</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relapse in schizophrenia: Definitively not a bolt from the blue.</title><secondary-title>Neuroscience letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuroscience letters</full-title></periodical><pages>68-74</pages><volume>669</volume><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prodromal Symptoms</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology</keyword><keyword>Secondary Prevention</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>27109788</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neulet.2016.04.044</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Detailed study of the period before schizophrenic relapse when early warning  signs (EWS) are present is crucial to effective pre-emptive strategies.

EWS history was obtained for 61 relapses resulting in hospitalization involving 51 patients with schizophrenia. Up to 20 weeks of EWS history per case were evaluated using a non-parametric bootstrap test and generalized mixed-effects model to test the significance and homogeneity of the findings. A statistically significant increase in EWS sum score was detectable 5 weeks before hospitalization. However, analysis of EWS dynamics revealed a gradual, monotonic increase in EWS score across during the 8 weeks before a relapse. The findings-in contrast to earlier studies-suggest that relapse is preceded by a lengthy period during which pathophysiological processes unfold; these changes are reflected in subjective EWS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Španiel, Filip</author><author>Horáček, Jiří</author><author>Tintěra, Jaroslav</author><author>Ibrahim, Ibrahim</author><author>Novák, Tomáš</author><author>Čermák, Jan</author><author>Klírová, Monika</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic variation in FOXP2 alters grey matter concentrations in schizophrenia  patients.</title><secondary-title>Neuroscience letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuroscience letters</full-title></periodical><pages>131-135</pages><volume>493</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenine Nucleotides</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Cytosine Nucleotides</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forkhead Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21334420</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neulet.2011.02.024</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>FOXP2, the first gene known to be involved in the development of speech and  language, can be considered to be, a priori, a candidate gene in schizophrenia, given the mounting evidence that the underlying core deficit in this disease could be a failure of structures relevant to normal language processing. To investigate the potential link between grey matter concentration (GMC) changes in patients with schizophrenia and the FOXP2 rs2396753 polymorphism previously reported to be associated with hallucinations in schizophrenia, we analysed high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance images of 40 genotyped patients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy controls, using optimised voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Here we show that the common SNP rs2396753 (C&gt;A) gene variant of the FOXP2 gene has significant effects on GMC in patients with schizophrenia, within regions of the brain known to be affected by this disease. Our data suggest that GMC reductions in schizophrenia may be driven by C allele carriers of the FOXP2 gene variant.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Kristensen, Annemarie T</author><author>Qvortrup, Karen</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of manual and automated methods for determining platelet counts in  dogs with macrothrombocytopenia.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</full-title></periodical><pages>167-170</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15053372</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/104063870401600215</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Platelet counts were performed in 43 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS, a  breed predisposed to macrothrombocytopenia) and in 10 control dogs using 3 automated systems and 3 manual methods (erythrocyte-lysing agents + counting chamber or evaluation of blood smear).

The current study aimed to investigate prevalence and risk factors for MCTs in dogs attending English primary-care veterinary practices. METHODS: Electronic patient records from practices participating in the VetCompass animal surveillance project between July 2007 and June 2013 were searched for MCT diagnosis. Various search terms and standard diagnostic terms (VeNom codes) identified records containing MCT diagnoses, which were evaluated against clinical criteria for inclusion to the study. MCT prevalence for the entire dataset and specific breed types were calculated. Descriptive statistics characterised MCT cases and multivariable logistic regression methods evaluated risk factors for association with MCT (P &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: Within a population of 168,636 dogs, 453 had MCT, yielding a prevalence of 0.27% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24% - 0.29%). The highest breed type specific prevalences were for the Boxer at 1.95% (95% CI 1.40% - 2.51%), Golden Retriever at 1.39% (0.98% - 1.81%) and Weimaraner at 0.85% (95% CI 0.17% to 1.53%). Age, insurance status, neuter status, weight and breed type were associated with MCT diagnosis. Of dogs of specific breed type, the Boxer, Pug and Staffordshire Bull Terrier showed greater odds of MCT diagnosis compared with crossbred dogs. Conversely, the German Shepherd Dog, Border Collie, West Highland White Terrier, Springer Spaniel and Cocker Spaniel had reduced odds of MCT diagnosis compared with crossbred dogs. No association was found between MCT diagnosis and sex. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights a clinically significant prevalence of MCT and identifies specific breed types with predisposition to MCT, potentially aiding veterinarian awareness and facilitating diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchis-Mora, S</author><author>Pelligand, L</author><author>Thomas, C L</author><author>Volk, H A</author><author>Abeyesinghe, S M</author><author>Brodbelt, D C</author><author>Church, D B</author><author>Thomson, P C</author><author>McGreevy, P D</author><author>O'Neill, D G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dogs attending primary-care practice in England with clinical signs suggestive of  Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>436</pages><volume>179</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Analgesics</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Insurance</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Primary Health Care</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27534983</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.103651</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia (CM/SM) in dogs describes a developmental  disorder that can cause pain and reduced quality of life. This retrospective study aimed to report the period prevalence, clinical signs and risk factors for diagnosis of symptomatic CM/SM in the veterinary primary-care setting using a cross-sectional design. The study population included all dogs within the VetCompass Programme (September 1, 2009-June 13, 2014). Overall, the period prevalence of symptomatic CM/SM was 0.05 per cent (95 per cent CI 0.04 per cent to 0.06 per cent) for all breeds. The period prevalence in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) was 1.6 per cent (95 per cent CI 1.2 to 2.06). Other breeds at increased odds included the King Charles Spaniel (KCS), Affenpinscher, Chihuahua and Pomeranian. Insured dogs had 4.6 times the odds (95 per cent CI 2.95 to 7.17) of having a diagnosis of CM/SM compared with uninsured dogs. Pain was the most commonly associated clinical sign (67 dogs, 72 per cent). Analgesics were prescribed to 72 (77.4 per cent) of the symptomatic dogs. Despite its low overall period prevalence, the high proportion of affected dogs identified with chronic pain suggests a significant welfare issue. Financial implications could impede the diagnostic process and lead to underestimation of the true prevalence. This study may help to inform clinicians about the clinical relevance and the need for improved awareness of clinical signs, particularly in high-risk breeds, to optimise the management of CM/SM in primary-care practice.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Batchelor, D J</author><author>German, A J</author><author>Shirazi-Beechey, S P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relevance of sodium/glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) to diabetes mellitus and  obesity in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Domestic animal endocrinology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Domestic animal endocrinology</full-title></periodical><pages>139-144</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport</keyword><keyword>Caco-2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Site-Directed</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Sodium-Glucose Transporter 1</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23375266</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.domaniend.2012.12.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Glucose transport across the enterocyte brush border membrane by sodium/glucose  cotransporter-1 (SGLT1, coded by Slc5a1) is the rate-limiting step for intestinal glucose transport. The relevance of SGLT1 expression in predisposition to diabetes mellitus and to obesity was investigated in dogs. Cultured Caco-2/TC7 cells were shown to express SGLT1 in vitro. A 2-kbp fragment of the Slc5a1 5' flanking region was cloned from canine genomic DNA, ligated into reporter gene plasmids, and shown to drive reporter gene expression in these cells above control (P &lt; 0.001). To determine the effect of the 3 known SNPs in this region on promoter function, new promoter/reporter constructs (all permutations of these 3 SNPs) were created by site-directed mutagenesis. No significant differences in promoter function were seen, suggesting that these SNPs do not have a significant effect on the constitutive transcription of SGLT1 mRNA in dogs. A search for novel SNPs in this region in dogs was made in 2 breeds predisposed to diabetes mellitus (Samoyed and cairn terrier), 2 breeds that rarely develop diabetes (boxer and German shepherd), and 2 breeds predisposed to obesity (Labrador retriever and cocker spaniel). The Slc5a1 5' flanking region was amplified from 10 healthy individuals of each of these breeds by high-fidelity PCR with the use of breed-labeled primers and sequenced by pyrosequencing. The sequence of the Slc5a1 5' flanking region in all individuals of all breeds tested was identical. On this evidence, variations in Slc5a1 promoter sequence between dogs do not influence the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus or obesity in these breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carrera, Ines</author><author>Hammond, Gawain J C</author><author>Sullivan, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomographic features of incomplete ossification of the canine humeral  condyle.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>226-231</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Developmental</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Joint Diseases</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radius</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>Ulna</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic  imaging</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18394068</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1532-950X.2008.00370.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To describe computed tomographic (CT) features of canine elbows with  incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle (IOHC) and investigate co-existing incongruence in the elbow joint. STUDY DESIGN: Case control study. ANIMALS: Dogs with IOHC (n=20; 38 elbows) and 25 normal elbows. METHODS: Elbows with IOHC and normal elbows were assessed by CT. Standardized dorsal and sagittal reconstructions were created at 3 levels using image analysis software to obtain single measurements of the humero-radial and humero-ulnar joint spaces. On dorsal plane reconstructions, joint space measurements were obtained at the center point of the humero-radial and humero-ulnar articulations. Joint incongruity was defined as the difference between the humero-radial and the humero-ulnar joint spaces. RESULTS: Nineteen dogs (95%), all Spaniel breeds, had either bilateral IOHC demonstrable as a saw-toothed intercondylar complete or incomplete hypoattenuating defect with hyperattenuating margins, or IOHC with contralateral humeral condylar fracture (HCF). Joint incongruity values for IOHC were compared with those of normal elbows. Significant differences were noted at the levels of the medial coronoid apex (P&lt;.0001) and base (P&lt;.004) indicative of humero-ulnar incongruence. Evidence of medial coronoid disease in 10 elbows (26%) and degenerative joint disease in 30 elbows (79%) was also found. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of elbow incongruence may be an underlying factor in failure of ossification centers to fuse leading to IOHC. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: IOHC is clearly defined by CT, and it should be considered in larger Spaniel breeds, with a chronic forelimb lameness or HCF.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walmsley, Gemma L</author><author>Arechavala-Gomeza, Virginia</author><author>Fernandez-Fuente, Marta</author><author>Burke, Margaret M</author><author>Nagel, Nicole</author><author>Holder, Angela</author><author>Stanley, Rachael</author><author>Chandler, Kate</author><author>Marks, Stanley L</author><author>Muntoni, Francesco</author><author>Shelton, G Diane</author><author>Piercy, Richard J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A duchenne muscular dystrophy gene hot spot mutation in dystrophin-deficient  cavalier king charles spaniels is amenable to exon 51 skipping.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e8647</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dystrophin</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20072625</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0008647</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which afflicts 1 in 3500 boys, is  one of the most common genetic disorders of children. This fatal degenerative condition is caused by an absence or deficiency of dystrophin in striated muscle. Most affected patients have inherited or spontaneous deletions in the dystrophin gene that disrupt the reading frame resulting in unstable truncated products. For these patients, restoration of the reading frame via antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach. The major DMD deletion &quot;hot spot&quot; is found between exons 45 and 53, and skipping exon 51 in particular is predicted to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in the greatest number of patients. Currently the mdx mouse is the most widely used animal model of DMD, although its mild phenotype limits its suitability in clinical trials. The Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model has a severe phenotype, but due to its large size, is expensive to use. Both these models have mutations in regions of the dystrophin gene distant from the commonly mutated DMD &quot;hot spot&quot;. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe the severe phenotype, histopathological findings, and molecular analysis of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy (CKCS-MD). The dogs harbour a missense mutation in the 5' donor splice site of exon 50 that results in deletion of exon 50 in mRNA transcripts and a predicted premature truncation of the translated protein. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 51 in cultured myoblasts from an affected dog restored the reading frame and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Given the small size of the breed, the amiable temperament and the nature of the mutation, we propose that CKCS-MD is a valuable new model for clinical trials of antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping and other therapeutic approaches for DMD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Legallet, Claire</author><author>Mankin, Kelley Thieman</author><author>Spaulding, Kathy</author><author>Mansell, Joanne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Granulomatous Inflammatory Response to a Microchip Implanted in a Dog for Eight  Years.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>227-229</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Identification Systems</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Granuloma</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28535132</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6418</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 8 yr old neutered male springer spaniel dog was referred to Texas A&amp;M  University, College of Veterinary Medicine for a large, firm, fixed mass, located in the dorsal cervical tissue.

As there is no agreement on the exact chemical arrangement of bone salts (13), the observed x-ray powder diffraction pattern may be taken as that corresponding to a calcium phosphate hydrated (14), a calcium phosphate of apatite structure (15), a pseudo-apatite (16), or a hydroxy apatite (17).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reimann, Maria J</author><author>Fredholm, Merete</author><author>Cremer, Signe E</author><author>Christiansen, Liselotte B</author><author>Meurs, Kathryn M</author><author>Møller, Jacob E</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Lykkesfeldt, Jens</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene and circulating concentrations of  neurotransmitters in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with myxomatous mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2596-2606</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Neurotransmitter Agents</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34599615</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16277</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) affects valvular degeneration  and dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) exhibit alterations in 5-HT signaling. In Maltese dogs, 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT transporter (SERT) gene are suggested to associate with MMVD. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Determine the association of SERT polymorphisms on MMVD severity and serum 5-HT concentration in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). Additionally, investigate the association between selected clinical and hematologic variables and serum 5-HT and assess the correlation between HPLC and ELISA measurements of serum 5-HT. ANIMALS: Seventy-one CKCS (42 females and 29 males; 7.8 [4.7;9.9] years (median [Q1;Q3])) in different MMVD stages. METHODS: This prospective study used TaqMan genotyping assays to assess SERT gene polymorphisms. Neurotransmitter concentrations were assessed by HPLC and ELISA. RESULTS: TaqMan analyses identified none of the selected SERT polymorphisms in any of the CKCS examined. Serum 5-HT was associated with platelet count (P &lt; .001) but not MMVD severity, age or medical therapy and did not correlate with serum concentration of the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The ELISA serum 5-HT correlated with HPLC measurements (ρ = .87; P &lt; .0001) but was lower (mean difference = -22 ng/mL; P = .02) independent of serum 5-HT concentration (P = .2). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Selected SERT SNPs associated with MMVD in Maltese dogs were not found in CKCS and only platelet count influenced serum 5-HT concentration. These SNPs are unlikely to be associated with MMVD pathophysiology or serum 5-HT concentration in CKCS. HPLC and ELISA serum 5-HT demonstrated good correlation but ELISA systematically underestimated 5-HT.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author><author>McFadyen, Angus K</author><author>Knower, Susan P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Behavioral and clinical signs of Chiari-like malformation-associated pain and  syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2138-2150</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pain</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31290195</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.15552</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation-associated pain (CM-P) or  clinically relevant syringomyelia (SM) is challenging. We sought to determine common signs. ANIMALS: One hundred thirty client-owned Cavalier King Charles spaniels with neuroaxis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosis of CM-P/SM. Dogs with comorbidities causing similar signs were excluded with exception of otitis media with effusion (OME). METHODS: Retrospective study of medical records relating signalment, signs, and MRI findings. Dogs were grouped by SM maximum transverse diameter (1 = no SM; 2 = 0.5-1.99 mm; 3 = 2-3.9 mm: 4 = ≥4 mm). Differences between all groups-groups 1 versus 2-4 and groups 1-3 versus 4-were investigated. Continuous variables were analyzed using 2-sample t-tests and analysis of variance. Associations between categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact or chi-square tests. RESULTS: Common signs were vocalization (65.4%), spinal pain (54.6%), reduced activity (37.7%), reduced stairs/jumping ability (35.4%), touch aversion (30.0%), altered emotional state (28.5%), and sleep disturbance (22%). Head scratching/rubbing (28.5%) was inversely associated with syrinx size (P = .005), less common in group 4 (P = .003), and not associated with OME (P = .977). Phantom scratching, scoliosis, weakness, and postural deficits were only seen in group 4 (SM ≥4 mm; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Signs of pain are common in CM/SM but are not SM-dependent, suggesting (not proving) CM-P causality. Wide (≥4 mm) SM is associated with signs of myelopathy and, if the dorsal horn is involved, phantom scratching (ipsilateral) and torticollis (shoulder deviated ipsilateral; head tilt contralateral).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barsotti, G</author><author>Vezzosi, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Keratoconjunctivitis sicca exacerbation in a dog treated with systemic atenolol.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>379-381</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atenolol</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27071733</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12477</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6-year-old, intact, male English cocker spaniel was referred for treatment of  chronic conjunctivitis and unilateral keratitis. The dog was diagnosed with bilateral immune-mediated keratoconjunctivitis sicca, treated with topical cyclosporine 0·2% ointment and sodium hyaluronate eye drops and improved considerably. After 2 months, pulmonic stenosis was diagnosed, and the dog commenced treatment with oral atenolol; the ophthalmological disease worsened dramatically within a few days. The ophthalmic signs rapidly improved after discontinuation of atenolol, and there was bilateral complete remission after 3 weeks. No oral β-blocker therapy was reintroduced, and thereafter, keratoconjunctivitis sicca was well-controlled with topical therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Min-Su</author><author>Kim, Dong Hoo</author><author>Choi, Ul Soo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Penile extramedullary plasmacytoma in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene</full-title></periodical><pages>e454-7</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Penile Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Plasmacytoma</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19919625</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1439-0531.2009.01555.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Penile tumours are rare in dogs. Reported herein is a case of a penile  extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) in a 5-year-old male cocker spaniel that was brought to a local hospital for an evaluation of a penile mass. The mass was approximately 1.3 cm in diameter at the time of presentation. In fine needle aspiration and histopathological examinations, the neoplastic cells showed eccentric round nuclei, a moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm, and a peri-nuclear clear zone, consistent with plasma cell morphology. There was nuclear pleomorphism with mononuclear giant cells and occasional bi-nucleation. Round cells on the periphery of the mass demonstrated plasmacytic differentiation. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells stained positive for MUM1 and light lambda chain. Based on the cytological and pathological observations, a diagnosis of penile EMP was established.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Knowler, S P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coexistence of occipital dysplasia and occipital hypoplasia/syringomyelia in the  cavalier King Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>603-606</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>17004953</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00048.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Concurrent occurrence of occipital dysplasia and occipital hypoplasia in two dogs  is described in this report. Occipital hypoplasia results in reduced volume of the caudal fossa, leading to overcrowding of the neural structures and, in severe cases, development of syringomyelia. In occipital dysplasia, there is a failure of complete ossification of the supraoccipital bone. When the two conditions occur concurrently, it is possible that syringomyelia may develop more slowly, resulting in presentation with clinical signs in middle to old age. This has implications for screening tests for early detection of syringomyelia, with a view to using the dog for breeding purposes, as dogs with an apparently mild phenotype for occipital hypoplasia/syringomyelia may actually have a more severe genotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Termote, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parotid salivary duct mucocoele and sialolithiasis following parotid duct  transposition.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>21-23</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</keyword><keyword>Mucocele</keyword><keyword>Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Parotid Diseases</keyword><keyword>Rupture, Spontaneous</keyword><keyword>Salivary Duct Calculi</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12570348</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00099.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 11-year-old, female neutered English springer spaniel presented with recurrent  episodes of mucopurulent discharge from the right eye, 17 months after parotid duct transposition, culminating in the development of a swelling over the infraorbital area.

ANIMALS: 134 healthy adult CKCS. METHODS: Ultrasound examinations were performed by trained observers in awake dogs. M-mode variables included left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, LV free wall and interventricular septal thicknesses at end-diastole and end-systole, and LV fractional shortening (FS%). The left atrium (LA) and aortic (Ao) diameters were measured using a 2D method, and the LA/Ao was calculated. Pulsed-wave Doppler variables included peak systolic aortic and pulmonary flow velocities, mitral E and A waves, and E/A ratio. Effects of BW, age, and gender on these 15 variables were tested using a general linear model, and RIs were determined by applying the statistical procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: A significant BW effect was observed for all variables, except LA/Ao, FS%, and mitral E/A ratio. A significant but negligible effect of gender and age was also observed for 5/15 and 4/15 of the tested variables, respectively. Only the BW effect on M-mode variables was considered as clinically relevant and the corresponding regression-based RIs were calculated. CONCLUSIONS: Body weight should be taken into account when interpreting echocardiographic values in CKCS, except for LA/Ao, FS%, and mitral E/A ratio.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Vohlídka, Pavel</author><author>Hrdlicka, Jan</author><author>Kozený, Jirí</author><author>Novák, Tomás</author><author>Motlová, Lucie</author><author>Cermák, Jan</author><author>Bednarík, Josef</author><author>Novák, Daniel</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ITAREPS: information technology aided relapse prevention programme in  schizophrenia.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia research</full-title></periodical><pages>312-317</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Antipsychotic Agents</keyword><keyword>Caregivers</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment, Health Care</keyword><keyword>Patient Compliance</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pilot Projects</keyword><keyword>Program Development</keyword><keyword>Program Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Remote Consultation</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenic Psychology</keyword><keyword>Secondary Prevention</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Telemedicine</keyword><keyword>Telephone</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>education</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>17920245</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.schres.2007.09.005</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>ITAREPS presents a mobile phone-based telemedicine solution for weekly remote  patient monitoring and disease management in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders in general. The programme provides health professionals with home telemonitoring via a PC-to-phone SMS platform that identifies prodromal symptoms of relapse, to enable early intervention and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. Its web-based interface offers the authorized physician a longitudinal analysis of the dynamics and development of possible prodromes. This work presents preliminary findings from a one-year mirror-design follow-up evaluation of the programme's clinical effectiveness in 45 patients with psychotic illness. There was a statistically significant 60% decrease in the number of hospitalizations during the mean 283.3+/-111.9 days of participation in the ITAREPS, compared to the same time period before the ITAREPS entry (sign test, p&lt;0.004). Variables significantly influencing the number of hospitalizations after the ITAREPS entry (medication compliance along with factors intrinsic to the ITAREPS, i.e. adherence to the programme and involvement of a family member) suggest a critical role of the programme in controlling the number of relapses and subsequent hospitalizations in psychosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoshimura, Aritada</author><author>Azakami, Daigo</author><author>Kishimoto, Miori</author><author>Ohmori, Takahiro</author><author>Hirao, Daiki</author><author>Morita, Shohei</author><author>Hasegawa, Shinogu</author><author>Morita, Tatsushi</author><author>Fukushima, Ryuji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A case of a dog with paragonimiasis after consumption of raw deer meat.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36948633</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1292/jvms.22-0443</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6-year-old castrated male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was referred to the  Animal Medical Center, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, for examination and treatment of recurrent pneumothorax.

Besides answering a questionnaire (husbandry and feeding of the puppies), the participation in this study included weekly weighing of the animals as well as exact documentation of the amount fed to the animals. Totally 67 dog breeders and 131 new owners of puppies participated. The weight development of the puppies was mostly parallel to the growth curve in the GS, Labradors and Shelties. There were some substantial differences to the ideal growth curve within the other breeds. The daily mean energy requirement was estimated too high, when including the growth curves. 80 - 90 % of the recommendations would be sufficient for most animals. The calcium supply was in the range of tolerance in all breeds. Nearly all breeders used commercially available complete food while raising the puppies. No breed-specific differences could be shown.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buijtels, J J C W M</author><author>Kroeze, E J B Veldhuis</author><author>Voorhout, G</author><author>Schellens, C J M M</author><author>van Nes, J J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Cerebellar cortical degeneration in an American Staffordshire terrier].</title><secondary-title>Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde</full-title></periodical><pages>518-522</pages><volume>131</volume><issue>14-15</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cerebellar Ataxia</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neurologic Examination</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Purkinje Cells</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16916197</accession-num><language>dut</language><urls/><abstract>Most diseases affecting the cerebellum are congenital and three groups can be  distinguished on pathogenetic grounds.

Histologically, the tumour consisted of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm forming acini and alveolar nests set within a loose fibrovascular stroma. The results of cell kinetic studies (AgNOR score 2.68, PCNA index 5.2%) were comparable with findings reported for benign human renal tumours.

In the axolemma adjacent to some of these processes there were paranode-like intramembranous specializations and node-like accumulations of E-face particles; in other instances, no special contacts formed between axons and the spiral processes. The outer surfaces of the spiral processes, which often apposed astrocytes, frequently contained gap junctions. Although many of the abnormalities identified in this dysmyelinating mutant by freeze-fracture electron microscopy are probably secondary to a more fundamental defect of myelin formation, the prominence of the spiral processes suggests that the encircling of axons by oligodendrocytes may be an independent state of ensheathment and not a passive effect of myelin formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wijnrocx, Katrien</author><author>Van Bruggen, Leonie W L</author><author>Eggelmeijer, Wieteke</author><author>Noorman, Erik</author><author>Jacques, Arnold</author><author>Buys, Nadine</author><author>Janssens, Steven</author><author>Mandigers, Paul J J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Twelve years of chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia scanning in Cavalier  King Charles Spaniels in the Netherlands: Towards a more precise phenotype.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0184893</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Artifacts</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Netherlands</keyword><keyword>Otitis Media with Effusion</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Quantitative Trait, Heritable</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28934242</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0184893</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CM), syringomyelia (SM) and middle ear effusion (also  called PSOM) are three conditions that frequently occur in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). Both CM and SM are currently screened in the Netherlands prior to breeding and are graded according to the British Veterinary Association's Kennel Club (BVA/KC) scheme. This study evaluated the prevalence and estimated genetic parameter of CM, SM and middle ear effusion from 12 years of screening results. For SM, the classical method using the BVA/KC scheme, was compared with exact measuring of the central canal dilation. For CM, the BVA/KC scheme was compared with a more detailed scheme. Next to this the presence of microchip artifacts was assessed. 1249 screening of 1020 dogs were re-evaluated. Results indicated the presence of CM in all dogs, suggesting it has become a breed-specific characteristic. And although different grades of CM were observed, the condition did not deteriorate over time. SM was present in 39% of the dogs and a clear age effect was demonstrated, with SM increasing with age. This emphasizes the importance of screening at appropriate age, since SM can worsen with increasing age. One alternative is to promote repeated measures. The presence of middle ear effusion in this study was 19%-21% for dogs younger than 3 years, and 32%-38% for dogs older than 3 years. In as much as 60%, microchip artifacts were noticed, leading to the recommendation to place microchips in another location in breeds that are susceptible to developing SM. Finally, this study estimated the heritability of CM in this population, due to the lack of phenotypic variance, to be very low at 0.02-0.03. The heritability for SM central canal dilatation to be 0.30, compared to 0.13 for the classical BVA/KC method, using a model including the age effect and the combined effect of veterinary clinic and year of the evaluation. Genetic correlations were rather small, ranging from 0.16-0.33. As a conclusion, screening for SM and CM in the entire population should be maintained, and a selection scheme against SM should be based on estimated breeding values for the exact measurement of the central canal dilatation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Španiel, Stanislav</author><author>Marhold, Karol</author><author>Passalacqua, Nicodemo G</author><author>Zozomová-Lihová, Judita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intricate variation patterns in the diploid-polyploid complex of Alyssum  montanum-A. repens (Brassicaceae) in the Apennine Peninsula: evidence for long-term persistence and diversification.</title><secondary-title>American journal of botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of botany</full-title></periodical><pages>1887-1904</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis</keyword><keyword>Brassicaceae</keyword><keyword>DNA, Chloroplast</keyword><keyword>Evolution, Molecular</keyword><keyword>France</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Genetics, Population</keyword><keyword>Italy</keyword><keyword>Phylogeography</keyword><keyword>Polyploidy</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22052961</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3732/ajb.1100147</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The Apennine Peninsula, one of the three peninsulas of the  European Mediterranean, is an important hotspot of genetic and species diversity, but studies devoted to plant evolution are still very scarce in this region. We studied the diploid-polyploid complex of Alyssum montanum-A. repens, focusing on Apennine and adjacent southwestern Alpine populations from southeastern France, with the aim of examining their taxonomic position and evolutionary patterns. METHODS: We employed AFLP markers and cpDNA sequences, along with cytotype determination using flow cytometry, and a multivariate morphometric approach. KEY RESULTS: The Italian and French populations formed two well-delimited groupings within the studied complex that were, in contrast to previous taxonomic treatments, clearly distinct from A. montanum. Populations from southeastern France represent A. orophilum, a previously described but abandoned species. Those from central and southern Italy correspond to A. diffusum, exhibiting high, geographically structured variation (central Apennines, Gargano, and southern Apennines/Calabria). This pattern coincides with hotspot refugial regions, in congruence with the &quot;refugia-within-refugia&quot; hypothesis, and is reflected here in the recognition of three subspecies within A. diffusum. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for the presence of Mediterranean refugia for the studied Alyssum montanum-A. repens complex located in central and southern Italy, which, however, did not contribute to the postglacial colonization of Central Europe. Past extinctions, genetic bottlenecks, and recent expansion were inferred in Central Europe, while long-term accumulation of diversity as well as polyploidization occurred in the Apennines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bond, R</author><author>Ferguson, E A</author><author>Curtis, C F</author><author>Craig, J M</author><author>Lloyd, D H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors associated with elevated cutaneous Malassezia pachydermatis populations  in dogs with pruritic skin disease.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>103-107</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermatomycoses</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Malassezia</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pruritus</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8683952</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.1996.tb02353.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The prevalences of breeds and concurrent diseases in a group of 40 dogs with  pruritic skin disease associated with elevated cutaneous Malassezia pachydermatis populations were compared with samples of a dermatological hospital population. The ages and genders of the affected dogs were comparable to those of the dermatology population. Basset hounds, cocker spaniels and West Highland white terriers were significantly overrepresented. Concurrent diseases were diagnosed in 27 dogs, of which 15 were atopic. However, the prevalences of atopic disease, primary keratinisation defects and endocrinopathies in dogs with elevated cutaneous M pachydermatis populations were comparable to those in the dermatology population as a whole. These results indicate that certain breeds are predisposed to the development of elevated cutaneous M pachydermatis populations and that concurrent skin diseases can frequently be identified in affected dogs. However, the relationship between these concurrent diseases and abnormal M pachydermatis populations remains unclear.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, S W</author><author>Alhadeff, J A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mammalian alpha-L-fucosidases.</title><secondary-title>Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

These enzymes are closely related structurally as indicated by immunochemical cross-reactivity and cloning studies. Mammalian fucosidases are sialoglycoproteins and the carbohydrate, particularly sialic acid, contributes to producing multiple isoforms which can differ in various species as well as in different tissues within a given species. alpha-L-Fucosidases exhibit maximal activity at pH values between 4 and 7, have similar kinetic properties with synthetic substrates (PNP-fucoside and 4-MU-fucoside), and exhibit broad substrate specificity on natural substrates. Numerous linkages (alpha 1-2, alpha 1-3, alpha 1-4, alpha 1-6), primarily to galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, can be hydrolyzed but preference is often seen for small mol. wt water-soluble substrates with fucose in alpha 1-2 linkage to galactose. The importance of alpha-L-fucosidase in mammalian metabolism is evidenced by deficiency or absence of its enzymatic activity leading to a fatal genetic disease, at least in humans and English Springer Spaniels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartley, W J</author><author>Canfield, P J</author><author>Donnelly, T M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A suspected new canine storage disease.</title><secondary-title>Acta neuropathologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta neuropathologica</full-title></periodical><pages>225-232</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Metabolic Diseases</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>Neuroglia</keyword><keyword>Neurons</keyword><keyword>Pancreas</keyword><keyword>Purkinje Cells</keyword><keyword>Vagus Nerve</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>7072491</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00690639</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This paper describes three cases of what is probably a new form of storage  disorder. The affected animals were English Springer Spaniels and they had developed progressive neurological signs when 2-3 years old. They had gross enlargement of the vagi and of the spinal nerves supplying the brachial plexus. By light microscopy in these nerves these were massive amounts of endoneurial loose fibrous tissue with dispersion of nerve fibres and many foamy phagocyte-like cells. In the central nervous system there was very severe cytoplasmic vacuolation of most neurones and neuroglia, perivascular phagocyte-like cells, loss of myelin, loss of Purkinje cells, numerous spheroids, hypertrophic astrocytes and fibrous astrocytosis. There was also foamy cytoplasmic vacuolation of renal convoluted tubules and pancreatic exocrine parenchyma and numerous foamy phagocyte-like cells in lymph node and lung. On ultrastructural examination membrane bound vacuoles were present in the cytoplasm of affected neurones and phagocyte-like cells. Most of the vacuoles were empty, some contained amorphous materials and some, in neurones, contained stacks of curved or straight lamellae. It is suggested that the stored material could be an oligosaccharide.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCartney, W T</author><author>Comiskey, D P</author><author>Mac Donald, B</author><author>Garvan, C B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fixation of humeral intercondylar fractures using a lateral plate in 14 dogs  supported by finite element analysis of repair.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>285-290</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Plates</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Finite Element Analysis</keyword><keyword>Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary</keyword><keyword>Fracture Healing</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>18038005</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Fourteen Spaniels that presented with an intercondylar fracture of the distal  humerus were managed using a lateral plate and an additional pin in twelve cases.

Of the 14 cases, two had poor results, one of which was a bilateral case, whilst the remaining 12 cases had good or very good results with only occasional stiffness or lameness. Finite element (FE) modelling of a distal humerus was generated, and loading of fracture repairs using a lateral plate and caudal plate was completed in a comparative study to determine which fixation method resisted micro-motion most effectively. Finite element analysis revealed that the lateral plate fixation provided significantly more resistance to micro movement at the fracture site that the caudal plate fixation, with 40% more micro-motion in the latter.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walter, J H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytokeratins in the canine epidermis.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>81-87</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Monoclonal</keyword><keyword>Blotting, Western</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Keratins</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>anatomy &amp; histology</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11360341</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-3164.2001.00219.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The purpose of this study was to characterize the cytokeratins (CKs) present in  the clinically normal skin of dogs. Skin samples from five German shepherds, five Boxers, five Cocker spaniels, five Yorkshire terriers and five mongrels were examined biochemically (using gel electrophoresis and western blotting) and immunohistochemically (using a alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique). Results indicated that the canine epidermis expressed the cytokeratins 1, 5, 6, 10/11, 14 and 16. There were no consistent differences in CK expression between the examined breeds with the exception of an individual polymorphism in CK1 and CK10/11. Immunohistochemical studies showed CK 14 labelling of the basal cell layer whereas CK10/11 staining was seen in the suprabasal cell layer of epidermis. Surprisingly, expression of CK6, known as 'stress' cytokeratin, was demonstrated in all epidermal samples. These results indicate that there is a striking consistency of cytokeratin expression in different breeds which should be useful in the investigation and characterization of canine skin diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gränitz, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Weak vision and blindness in the dog--a retrospective study].</title><secondary-title>Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift</full-title></periodical><pages>295-299</pages><volume>107</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blindness</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electroretinography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Vision Tests</keyword><keyword>Vision, Low</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7980378</accession-num><language>ger</language><urls/><abstract>Clinical-ophthalmological and electroretinographic results were found, compared  and evaluated in 73 dogs of 21 different breeds with signs of decreased vision or blindness.

Low erythrocyte PFK activity together with low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations and a high hemoglobin-oxygen affinity confirmed the diagnosis. The PFK deficiency is due to a single missense mutation in the muscle-type PFK M-PFK gene in English springer and American cocker spaniels, whippets, and mixed-breed dogs; however, these PFK-deficient Wachtelhunds do not have the same PFK mutation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wijnrocx, Katrien</author><author>François, Liesbeth</author><author>Goos, Peter</author><author>Buys, Nadine</author><author>Janssens, Steven</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the relative importance of health and conformation traits in the  cavalier king Charles spaniel.</title><secondary-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine genetics and epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29403647</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-017-0056-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The selection of a future breeding dog is a complicated task, in  which disease characteristics and different traits have to be combined and weighed against one another. Truncation selection, that is the exclusion of affected animals, may be very inefficient when selecting on a large number of traits, and may result in a reduction of the genetic diversity in a population or breed. Selection could be facilitated by the use of a selection index that combines multiple traits or breeding values into one score. This however requires a consideration of their relative value according to their economic weight, which is difficult to express in monetary units for health traits. The use of a choice experiment to derive non-market values might be a solution to this problem. This is a pilot study to assess the potential use of choice experiments to ascertain the public preference and relative importance attached to health- and conformation traits in the selection of a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The focus was on two prevalent disorders, mitral valve disease and syringomyelia, and on several important conformation traits such as muzzle length and eye shape. Based on available prior information, a Bayesian D-optimal design approach was used to develop a choice experiment and the resulting choice sets. RESULTS: Every participant (breeder or owner) in the choice experiment was presented with a total of 17 choice sets, in which at most four traits could vary to reduce the cognitive burden. A total of 114 respondents participated in the choice experiment and results showed that respondents (breeders/owners) current attitudes were directed towards health (syringomyelia and mitral valve disease), followed by eye shape and level of inbreeding. CONCLUSIONS: This approach identifies the value breeders and owners attach to certain traits in the breeding objective. The resulting relative weights, represented as the logworths obtained from the choice experiment, could be an alternative to economic weights. They could be implemented as a weight when breeding values are available, but more study on this topic will be necessary. A challenge in this approach is to scale up the experiment with additional traits. Moreover, for other traits, the genetic parameters and correlations should be known first, in order to include them in the health selection index as well.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Egenvall, A</author><author>Bonnett, B N</author><author>Shoukri, M</author><author>Olson, P</author><author>Hedhammar, A</author><author>Dohoo, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Age pattern of mortality in eight breeds of insured dogs in Sweden.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Distribution</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Insurance, Life</keyword><keyword>Mortality</keyword><keyword>Poisson Distribution</keyword><keyword>Proportional Hazards Models</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10854932</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0167-5877(00)00135-5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of this study was to use several methods to describe the age  patterns for risk of death in selected breeds of dogs insured for life in a Swedish animal-insurance company in 1996. Data on eight breeds were analyzed for age at death (including euthanasia). If dogs left the insurance for reasons other than death, they were regarded as censored. Dogs were only insured up to 10 years of age. Four analytical approaches were used. First, descriptive statistics of age distributions (e.g. breed-specific median ages at death, breed- and age-specific mortality risks) were computed. Second, age-specific estimates of survival were calculated using the formula: survival=(1-risk(age&lt;1 year))(1-risk(age 1&lt;2 year))... (1-risk(age 9&lt;1 0 year)). Third, Cox regression (proportional-hazards model) was used to estimate survival and hazard functions. Finally, hierarchically coded Poisson regression was used to determine age-specific cut-points in the risk of death. The hazards from Cox and the incidence-density rates from the hierarchically coded models were transformed to estimates of risk: risk=1-exp¿-(hazard)¿ or 1-exp¿-(incidence-density rate)¿. The breeds studied were Beagle, Bernese mountain dog, Boxer, Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Drever, German shepherd dog, Mongrel and Poodle, together representing over 50000 dogs each year. The yearly breed-specific mortality risk varied between 1.7% (Poodle) and 6.5% (Bernese mountain dog). In all breeds, the risk of death increased with age but the pattern varied by breed. The probability of survival at 5 years of age varied between 94% (Cavalier King Charles spaniel and Poodle) and 83% (Bernese mountain dog, Drever, German shepherd dog) and the survival at 10 years between 83% (Poodle) and 30% (Bernese mountain dog). The survival estimates from Cox and those derived using the combined-risk formula were similar. The cut-point risk estimates provided a simplified picture of when the risk of death changed significantly compared to previous age categories. As anticipated, breeds differed widely in survival up to 10 years of age and there were marked differences in age patterns of mortality. The implications of these findings should be considered in multivariable analyses, where the confounding effect of age is often controlled for using a single age variable common to several breeds.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Østergård Jensen, Sarah</author><author>Christen, Matthias</author><author>Rondahl, Veronica</author><author>Holland, Christopher T</author><author>Jagannathan, Vidhya</author><author>Leeb, Tosso</author><author>Giger, Urs</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EHBP1L1 Frameshift Deletion in English Springer Spaniel Dogs with  Dyserythropoietic Anemia and Myopathy Syndrome (DAMS) or Neonatal Losses.</title><secondary-title>Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Anemia</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Frameshift Mutation</keyword><keyword>Genetic Association Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Muscular Diseases</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36140701</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/genes13091533</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hereditary myopathies are well documented in dogs, whereas hereditary  dyserythropoietic anemias are rarely seen. The aim of this study was to further characterize the clinical and clinicopathological features of and to identify the causative genetic variant for a dyserythropoietic anemia and myopathy syndrome (DAMS) in English springer spaniel dogs (ESSPs). Twenty-six ESSPs, including five dogs with DAMS and two puppies that died perinatally, were studied. Progressive weakness, muscle atrophy-particularly of the temporal and pelvic muscles-trismus, dysphagia, and regurgitation due to megaesophagus were observed at all ages. Affected dogs had a non-regenerative, microcytic hypochromic anemia with metarubricytosis, target cells, and acanthocytes. Marked erythroid hyperplasia and dyserythropoiesis with non-orderly maturation of erythrocytes and inappropriate microcytic metarubricytosis were present. Muscle biopsies showed centralized nuclei, central pallor, lipocyte infiltrates, and fibrosis, which was consistent with centronuclear myopathy. The genome sequencing of two affected dogs was compared to 782 genomes of different canine breeds. A homozygous frameshift single-base deletion in EHBP1L1 was identified; this gene was not previously associated with DAMS. Pedigree analysis confirmed that the affected ESSPs were related. Variant genotyping showed appropriate complete segregation in the family, which was consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This study expands the known genotype-phenotype correlation of EHBP1L1 and the list of potential causative genes in dyserythropoietic anemias and myopathies in humans. EHBP1L1 deficiency was previously reported as perinatally lethal in humans and knockout mice. Our findings enable the genetic testing of ESSP dogs for early diagnosis and disease prevention through targeted breeding strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abed Alla, S</author><author>Locatelli, A</author><author>Losio, S</author><author>Allevi, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surgical removal of a sewing needle penetrated through the foramen lacerum into a  canine brain.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>78-81</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fluoroscopy</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Needles</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34109622</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13391</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An intracranial metallic foreign body (sewing needle) was diagnosed in an  11-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

METHODS: Formalin-fixed tissues were processed into paraffin wax and epoxy resin for light and transmission electron microscopy of variously stained tissue sections. RESULTS: Significant lesions relevant to the disease were found only in the brain. They consisted of hypoplasia of the cerebellum and the presence of large pale inclusions in the perikaryon of neurons in the neocortex and in macrophages. The inclusion material was not compartmentalised and did not stain for carbohydrate, mucopolysaccharide or lipid. This material displaced nuclei to the periphery of the cells where they were seen as basophilic distorted crescent-shaped structures. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusions were probably made of polymerised protein similar, though not identical, to those of Pick, Lewy and Collins bodies that characterise a variety of chronic neurodegenerative diseases of humans. A genetic basis to this disease was considered probable.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foster, Aiden P</author><author>Evans, Elle</author><author>Kerlin, Roy L</author><author>Vail, David M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with Sézary syndrome in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>188-192</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>12658584</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-165x.1997.tb00735.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 8-year-old female spayed Cocker Spaniel mix breed dog was presented with  generalized erythroderma, scaling and alopecia.

Similar cells were observed in the peripheral blood and in skin biopsies. The cells in the skin biopsies were epidermotropic, indicative of an uncommon cutaneous lymphoma termed cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), sometimes also called mycosis fungoides. Immunohistochemical staining of a skin biopsy was positive for the CD3 antigen demonstrating that the lymphocyte infiltrate was of a T-cell lineage. The presence of neoplastic lymphocytes in the epidermis and peripheral blood indicate that this is a rare variant of Cutaneous Epidermotropic Lymphoma (CEL) called Sézary syndrome based on nomenclature used in the human literature.

The CKCS is also a breed highly predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The aim of this study was to determine urine concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the major metabolite and excretion product of serotonin, in a population of CKCS with preclinical MMVD, and to evaluate whether urine 5-HIAA concentrations were associated with MMVD severity, dog characteristics, setting for urine sampling, platelet count, and serotonin concentration in serum and platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The study population consisted of 40 privately-owned CKCS (23 females; 17 males) with and without preclinical MMVD as follows: American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) group A (n = 11), ACVIM group B1 (n = 21) and ACVIM group B2 (n = 8). Urine 5-HIAA concentrations were not significantly associated with preclinical MMVD disease, platelet count or circulating concentrations of serotonin (in serum and PPP; P &gt; 0.05). Females had higher 5-HIAA concentrations than males in morning urine collected at home (females, 3.1 [2.9-3.7] μmol/mmol creatinine [median and quartiles]; males, 1.7 [1.2-2.2] μmol/mmol creatinine; P = 0.0002) and urine collected at the clinic (females, 3.5 [3.1-3.9] μmol/mmol creatinine; males, 1.6 [1.3-2.1] μmol/mmol creatinine; P &lt; 0.0001). Five-HIAA concentrations in urine collected at home and at the clinic were significantly associated (P = 0.0004; r = 0.73), and higher concentrations were found in urine collected at the clinic (P = 0.013). Urine 5-HIAA concentration was influenced by sex and setting of urine sampling. Urine 5-HIAA concentration was not associated with MMVD severity or circulating concentrations of serotonin in CKCS with preclinical disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Tintera, Jaroslav</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Dezortova, Monika</author><author>Hajek, Milan</author><author>Dockery, Colleen</author><author>Kozeny, Jiri</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Language lateralization in monozygotic twins discordant and concordant for  schizophrenia.

METHODS: Functional MRI was used to assess differences in cortical activation during a verbal task in Broca's area and its contralateral homologue in four pairs of right-handed monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant and concordant for schizophrenia with low and high familial loading for the illness and four healthy control MZ twin pairs. RESULTS: Pooled data from all subjects with schizophrenia showed increased activation in the right homologue of Broca's area in contrast to healthy individuals. Concordant twins (i.e. high familial loading group) showed prominent between co-twin differences in lateralization index within given region of interest. Intra-pair differences in lateralization index were significantly higher in concordant twins compared to the controls (0.69+/-0.4 vs. 0.13+/-0.13, P&lt;0.03), albeit no significant differences in the variable were shown between the discordant and control groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of reduced cerebral dominance for language processing in patients with schizophrenia. The findings further suggest the need for additional research on relative proportion of genetic and environmental factors underlying deviations of functional asymmetry in schizophrenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vuong, Kristina S</author><author>Aoki, Koji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-organ infection involving a left adrenal gland abscess in a diabetic dog.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>154-159</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Abscess</keyword><keyword>Adrenal Glands</keyword><keyword>Adrenalectomy</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33542554</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 14-year-old, intact male, American cocker spaniel dog was presented with a  5-day history of lethargy, inappetence, loose stools, abdominal pain, and hematuria.

Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan revealed diffuse left adrenomegaly, splenic nodules, prostatomegaly, bilateral testicular cysts, and a hepatic mass. The dog underwent an exploratory laparotomy and a left adrenalectomy. Histopathology of the left adrenal gland was consistent with an adrenal abscess.

The specific clinical signs in this specimen were miosis, ptosis, enophthalmos, and prolapsed nictitans for 2 days following sudden onset. According to history taking, ophthalmic, neurological, and radiological examination, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic Horner's syndrome. Manual acupuncture treatment was applied to the dog on local points two times in 2 days. The local acupoints were ST-4 (Di Chang) and GB-1 (Tong Zi Liao). The day after the initial acupuncture treatment, clinical signs related to idiopathic Horner's syndrome had almost disappeared. The day after the second treatment, specific clinical signs were completely absent. During this period, the dog did not receive any orthodox treatment. Thus, it is suggested that manual acupuncture might be an effective therapy for idiopathic Horner's syndrome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Platt, Simon</author><author>McGrotty, Yvonne L</author><author>Abramson, Carley J</author><author>Jakobs, Cornelis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Refractory seizures associated with an organic aciduria in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>163-167</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anticonvulsants</keyword><keyword>Bromides</keyword><keyword>Carnitine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drug Therapy, Combination</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glycine</keyword><keyword>Levetiracetam</keyword><keyword>Phenobarbital</keyword><keyword>Piracetam</keyword><keyword>Potassium Compounds</keyword><keyword>Seizures</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17473023</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/0430163</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6-month-old, female Cavalier King Charles spaniel exhibited seizures that were  difficult to control with standard anticonvulsants over a 12-month period.

Canine breeds with a predisposition to higher eosinophil counts or certain eosinophilic diseases include the Rottweiler, German Shepard, Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Two of the more common causes of canine hypereosinophilia are pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophils (PIE) and gastrointestinal disease. The highest eosinophil counts are expected in dogs with pneumonia or PIE. The most common cause of eosinophilia in cats is flea allergy. The greatest eosinophilia occurs in cats with flea allergy, feline asthma, and eosinophilic granuloma. Innovative recent treatments for human patients with asthma have been successful in reducing eosinophil numbers but have had a confusing and disappointing lack of reducing symptoms. The role of eosinophils in many eosinophilic diseases remains a mystery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Zyl, M</author><author>Hyman, W B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Desoxycorticosterone pivalate in the management of canine primary  hypoadrenocorticism.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the South African Veterinary Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the South African Veterinary Association</full-title></periodical><pages>125-129</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Addison Disease</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Desoxycorticosterone</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7595920</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Primary hypoadrenocorticism in dogs may be poorly responsive to oral  fluorocortisone treatment.

Patchy long-bone medullary sclerosis, nonregenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia, multiple acellular bone marrow aspirates, marked splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and acellular core bone marrow biopsy with areas of necrosis and fibrosis supported the diagnosis of myelofibrosis. Despite the medical and surgical management attempted, the dog was euthanatized because of signs of severe intractable bone pain.

In the canine models, skeletal dysplasia was progressive. Lesions were noted at 2 months of age and characterized by retarded endochondral ossification and osteoporosis. Older puppies had focal cartilage necrosis within lumbar vertebral epiphyses. At the cellular level, lesions were characterized by chondrocytic hypertrohy and lysosomal accumulation of storage compounds. Our studies illustrate that the skeletal lesions in both canine models are similar to those in a child with GM1-gangliosidosis. Furthermore, we proposed that the abnormal storage of partially degraded compounds in affected chondrocytes might explain, at least in part, the retarded bone formation noted in patients with GM1-gangliosidosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoon, J S</author><author>Park, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunohistochemical characterization of sebaceous epithelioma in two dogs.</title><secondary-title>Iranian journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Iranian journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>134-136</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27822240</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This report describes two cases of sebaceous epithelioma and its  immunohistochemical characterization with CK 14, CK18, p63, Ki67 and Bcl-2 immunostaining.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining showed that the nodules in both cases were irregular lobules comprised of epithelial cells around well-differentiated sebocytes. Neoplastic cells were positive for CK14 and p63 but were negative for CK18 cell marker. In addition, immunostaining for Ki67 proliferation marker showed 13.1% and 12.4% positive cells in the two cases, respectively. Furthermore, Bcl-2, which is highly expressed in human benign sebaceous tumors, was seen in basaloid cell nuclei and cytoplasm.

In the dog of this report, the extension of melting to nearly the entire corneal surface limited surgical options. Following surgery and later resection of the graft, the patient is visual with minimal corneal opacity. Numerous corneal grafting techniques have been described in companion animals, but require special materials and may not be possible when melting is extensive. Although older animals or animals with additional corneal pathology may have less ideal outcomes in terms of corneal clarity than the patient of this report, we believe that 360-degree conjunctival grafting offers a viable and cost-effective option for management of cases with extensive keratomalacia that may otherwise have resulted in enucleation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Galán, A</author><author>Martín-Suárez, E M</author><author>Molleda, J M</author><author>Raya, A</author><author>Gómez-Laguna, J</author><author>Martín De Las Mulas, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presumed primary uveal melanoma with brain extension in a dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>306-310</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Euthanasia, Animal</keyword><keyword>Eye Enucleation</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Intraocular Pressure</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Ocular Hypertension</keyword><keyword>Uveal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19527424</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00721.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 13-year-old, female, mixed, cocker spaniel was examined for a unilateral  exophthalmia and protruding mass in episcleral region of the right eye.

The clinical and ultrasonographic findings were consistent with aortic thromboembolism. Anti-thrombotic and vasodilative therapy was not helpful and the dog was euthanized 3 days after the onset of paraplegia. A thrombus in the aortic trifurcation, multiple thoracic and abdominal aneurysms and a distal mediastinal esophageal granuloma containing Spirocera lupi worms were found on necropsy.

Multifocal lesions were seen throughout the lungs, nasal turbinates, cerebral cortex, and the optic nerve of each eye. Microscopically, the multifocal lesions were granulomas consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and cryptococcal organisms. Infection may have originated in the nasal passages and extended directly through the ethmoid plate into the meninges of the CNS and optic nerves. Although the prognosis is poor in dogs with CNS involvement, various chemotherapeutic agents are available for use by clinicians.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Work, M</author><author>Allerton, F</author><author>Griffin, S</author><author>Kent, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Percutaneous-endoscopic rendezvous cholangiography with biliary stent placement  in a dog with extra-hepatic biliary duct obstruction.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>416-420</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cholangiography</keyword><keyword>Cholestasis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endoscopy</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Stents</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34658028</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.13442</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A middle-aged male springer spaniel was presented for investigation of acute  vomiting, lethargy and icterus. Marked distension of the gall bladder and common bile duct was evident at ultrasound due to obstruction by mineralised intraluminal material. After 48 hours of hospitalisation with intravenous fluid therapy, analgesia and antimicrobial therapy, intervention was deemed necessary to relieve the obstruction. A percutaneous-endoscopic rendezvous approach was used to achieve placement of a pigtail stent into the distal common bile duct, successfully relieving the obstruction. Serial biochemistry measurements postprocedure confirmed marked improvements in serum bilirubin. The patient remains clinically well 24 months postprocedure, and all hepatic enzyme activities have normalised.

The mass had a multilobular growth pattern and each individual lobule contained ductal epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells surrounding the ductal cells. Immunohistochemically, the ductal epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CAM5.2 and the myoepithelial cells were positive for α-smooth muscle actin and p63. Both types of cells were positive for CK14, a myoepithelial cell marker. Ultrastructurally, the ductal epithelial cells were attached by desmosomes and contained abundant intracytoplasmic tonofilaments. Some ductal epithelial cells contained myofilaments characteristic of myoepithelial cells. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma was made. It is presumed that the tumour originated from an intercalated duct in a parotid salivary gland.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeiss, Caroline J</author><author>Dubielzig, Richard R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A morphologic study of intravitreal membranes associated with intraocular  hemorrhage in the dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>239-243</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Vitreous Hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15200620</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2004.04033.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Abstract We aimed to characterize intravitreal membranes in dogs and determine,  if possible, associated predisposing conditions. Five globes in which intravitreal membranes were identified were evaluated. These originated from four Labrador Retrievers or Labrador-cross dogs and a Springer Spaniel. The ages of the dogs ranged from 4 to 11 years. Standard histology and immunohistochemical procedures for factor VIII-related antigen, smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were performed. Intravitreal membranes varied from loosely to highly organized. The extent of organization corresponded with increasing immunoreactivity for vimentin and GFAP, indicating their predominantly glial origin. They were never immunopositive for smooth muscle actin, nor were they vascularized. In all cases, they were associated with intravitreal hemorrhage. Additional common findings included epiretinal membranes, retinal neovascularization, preiridal fibrovascular membranes and glaucoma. Intravitreal membranes may be a sequelae of intravitreal hemorrhage. This in turn, may arise from new vessels associated with epiretinal or preiridial membranes, or hemorrhage associated with optic disc cupping or retinal neovascularization. All of these phenomena may accompany glaucoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boevé, M H</author><author>Stades, F C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Glaucoma in dogs and cats.

A review of case records at  the University of Utrecht Small Animal Clinic revealed that during a 4-year period glaucoma accounted for 8.6% of all ophthalmological diagnoses. Glaucoma is defined as an increased intraocular pressure, which sooner or later leads to loss of function of the eye. Primary and secondary types can be distinguished. In primary glaucoma an increased intraocular pressure exists in the absence of other primary eye disorders. By gonioscopy a discrimination can be made between open and narrow or closed anterior chamber angle forms of primary glaucoma. This requires a clear distinction between the definitions of chamber angle and filtration angle. In the Netherlands primary glaucoma is seen especially in the American Cocker Spaniel, Bouvier and Basset breeds. In secondary glaucoma an increased intraocular pressure occurs as a consequence of another primary eye disorder. Dislocation of the lens is the main cause for secondary glaucoma. Several-mainly small-terrier breeds are predisposed to this entity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duncan, I D</author><author>Griffiths, I R</author><author>Munz, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>'Shaking pups': a disorder of central myelination in the spaniel dog.

Astrocyte numbers were similar in both normal and affected pups. Axonal diameters were not reduced in the affected pups and there was no apparent correlation between myelination and axonal size in these animals.

The disease is most common in middle-aged female dogs, especially American cocker spaniels. The common clinical signs are associated with severe anemia and the resultant inflammatory response. There is no pathognomonic test for IMHA, but the following are suggestive of it: the presence of hemolytic anemia in a young adult or middle-aged dog of a predisposed breed, autoagglutination and/or spherocytosis, positive results from a direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test, elimination of any other underlying cause of anemia, and an appropriate response to immunosuppressive therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, Penny</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic pancreatitis in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Topics in companion animal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>133-139</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis, Chronic</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23148854</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.tcam.2012.04.006</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chronic pancreatitis used to be considered uncommon in dogs, but recent  pathological and clinical studies have confirmed that it is in fact a common and clinically significant disease. Clinical signs can vary from low-grade recurrent gastrointestinal signs to acute exacerbations that are indistinguishable from classical acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a significant cause of chronic pain in dogs, which must not be underestimated. It also results in progressive impairment of endocrine and exocrine function and the eventual development of diabetes mellitus or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or both in some affected dogs at end stage. The etiology is unknown in most cases. Chronic pancreatitis shows an increased prevalence in certain breeds, and recent work in English Cocker Spaniels suggests it is part of a polysystemic immune-mediated disease in this breed. The histological and clinical appearance is different in different breeds, suggesting that etiologies may also be different. Diagnosis is challenging because the sensitivities of the available noninvasive tests are relatively low. However, with an increased index of suspicion, clinicians will recognize more cases that will allow them to institute supportive treatment to improve the quality of life of the patient.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Granger, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine inherited motor and sensory neuropathies: an updated classification in 22  breeds and comparison to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>274-285</pages><volume>188</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20638305</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.06.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine inherited neuropathies form a group of degenerative diseases affecting  motor and/or sensory and autonomic peripheral nerves. There is now a large number of inherited motor and sensory neuropathies (IMSN) reported in the veterinary literature, for which clinical, electrophysiological, histopathological and mode of inheritance data are available. Their resemblance with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in humans is suggested, although direct comparison is difficult due to the small number of cases described in each breed and the lack of genetic knowledge in dogs. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease forms a wide group of hereditary neuropathies for which a genetic mutation is recognised in more than 70% of patients. In dogs, no genetic mutation has so far been identified and the knowledge available for human hereditary neuropathies may be useful to identify genetic mutations in dogs. This review provides an update on data available on inherited neuropathy in Leonberger dogs and three new degenerative neuropathies are briefly described in two Russian Black terriers, two Cocker Spaniels and a Podhale Shepherd dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baumworcel, Natasha</author><author>Soares, Ana M B</author><author>Helms, Gustavo</author><author>Rei, Paulo R L</author><author>Castro, Maria Cristina N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Three hundred and three dogs with cataracts seen in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>299-301</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19751489</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2009.00715.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the most common canine breeds affected with cataracts in  Rio de Janeiro. ANIMALS: Three hundred and three dogs were included in this retrospective study. Animal ages ranged from 6 months to 14.8 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All records of dogs seen by the Ophthalmology Service of Policlínica Veterinária Botafogo between January 2005 and June 2008 were reviewed. Animals with cataracts were separated, and breed and age were evaluated. RESULTS: Most of the dogs presented with cataracts were Toy Poodles with a mean age of 8.2 years, followed by Cocker Spaniels and Bichon Frises. The percentage of Toy Poodles affected with cataracts was 13.8% while 33.3% of Bichon Frise was diagnosed with cataracts. CONCLUSIONS: Toy Poodles are a popular breed in Rio de Janeiro. Without regulations on breeding, the prevalence of cataracts may increase rapidly. Furthermore, due to the relatively late onset of cataract formation in the Toy Poodle (mean 8.2 years of age), affected animals may have produced several litters of puppies. This study emphasizes the importance of screening for the presence of inherited ocular abnormalities such as cataracts prior to breeding.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Sullivan, E N</author><author>Jones, B R</author><author>O'Sullivan, K</author><author>Hanlon, A J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of 234 dog bite incidents in Ireland during 2004 and 2005.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>37-42</pages><volume>163</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Bites and Stings</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Euthanasia, Animal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interviews as Topic</keyword><keyword>Ireland</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18621994</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.163.2.37</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Information was obtained by telephone interview from 100 dog owners whose dog had  bitten a person, and from 134 victims of bites by a dog not owned by the victim. Three-quarters of the victims were female and aged from 21 to 60 years. The majority of the dogs were owned, male, two to six years old, over 10 kg in bodyweight and belonged to the popular breeds: collies, cocker/springer spaniels, terrier breeds, Jack Russell terriers, German shepherd dogs, golden retrievers and crossbreeds. The numbers of bites by the different breeds indicated that those that inflicted the most bites were the popular breeds rather than the breeds with any greater propensity to bite. Most attacks were rapid single bites and in 50 per cent of the cases, neither the owner nor the victim was able to identify any signal of the dog's intention to bite. Overall, 21 per cent of the incidents were rated as 'serious' and 2 per cent as 'life threatening'. One fifth of the dogs were euthanased as a result of the incident. Half the incidents required professional medical assistance for the victim. Almost half the incidents took place while the victim was walking or passing close to the dog's territory, or while the victim was interacting with the dog at home.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rowland, P H</author><author>Valentine, B A</author><author>Stebbins, K E</author><author>Smith, C A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cutaneous plasmacytomas with amyloid in six dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>125-130</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Amyloid</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Congo Red</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear, External</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulins</keyword><keyword>Lip</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Plasmacytoma</keyword><keyword>Potassium Permanganate</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Staining and Labeling</keyword><keyword>Toes</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year></dates><accession-num>1712141</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/030098589102800204</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cutaneous plasmacytomas associated with local deposition of amyloid were  diagnosed by light microscopy in a series of six older dogs (mean age 10.7 years) consisting of two Cocker Spaniels, a Poodle, a Weimeraner, and two mixed-breed dogs. The neoplasms occurred on the digits (2 dogs), forelimb (2 dogs), lip (1 dog), and ear (1 dog). In most cases, groups of neoplastic plasma cells were widely separated by large homogeneous islands of amyloid. The neoplastic cells had characteristic plasmacytoid features, but the degree of pleomorphism varied greatly between different neoplasms. In four of the six tumors, the diagnosis of plasmacytoma was confirmed by the demonstration of a monoclonal plasma cell population using immunofluorescent staining for anti-canine immunoglobulins. In these tumors, the neoplastic cells reacted with only one class of immunoglobulins (IgG). The amyloid did not react with any of the reagents used. The suspicion that the amyloid was of immunoglobulin origin (primary amyloid) was supported by its retention of birefringence under polarized light after treatment with potassium permanganate and staining with Congo red.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Jury</author><author>Ji, Dong-Beom</author><author>Takiyama, Naoaki</author><author>Bae, Jaehyun</author><author>Kim, Min-Su</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Corneal collagen cross-linking following superficial keratectomy as treatment for  corneal endothelial cell dystrophy in dogs: Preliminary clinical study.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>440-447</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Collagen</keyword><keyword>Combined Modality Therapy</keyword><keyword>Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary</keyword><keyword>Corneal Pachymetry</keyword><keyword>Cross-Linking Reagents</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Keratectomy</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Photosensitizing Agents</keyword><keyword>Riboflavin</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30109755</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vop.12611</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL)  combined with superficial keratectomy (SK) as treatment for corneal edema due to corneal endothelial dystrophy (CED) in dogs. ANIMALS STUDIED: Four eyes of four dogs (3 Shih Tzus and 1 English Cocker Spaniel) with corneal edema due to CED were treated with SK and CXL. Two were males, and two were females. PROCEDURE: Depending on corneal thickness, 500-700 μm of edematous cornea was removed by SK. Next, CXL was performed by irradiating the cornea with UVA (365 nm) at 3 mW/cm² irradiance for 30 min after soaking with 0.1% riboflavin in 20% dextran every three minutes for 30 minutes. One drop of riboflavin was instilled every three minutes during irradiation. Slit lamp biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography were used to examine the cornea during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The corneas had focal to diffuse edema, and the average corneal thickness was 1553 (1282-1900) μm. All corneas showed a significantly reduced corneal thickness and regained marked transparency immediately after treatment; however, the opacity increased as the corneal thickness increased during the follow-up period. Corneal vascularization (n = 4) disappeared within a month. Corneal pigmentation (n = 1) and bullae (n = 1) were observed. All cases showed marked reduction in corneal thickness; however, transparency was improved in only one case. CONCLUSION: Collagen cross-linking with SK has the potential to reduce the corneal thickness in CED cases; however, a lasting clinically significant improvement of corneal transparency seems unlikely. As the added benefit of CXL to the SK procedure is unclear based on the results of this study, combined treatment of CXL and SK for the treatment of corneal edema caused by CED is currently not recommended in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bearss, J J</author><author>Schulman, F Y</author><author>Carter, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of 27 mammary tumors in 18  male dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>602-607</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21441113</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0300985811402843</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Twenty-seven mammary tumors from 18 male (3 intact, 15 neutered) dogs were  collected. The average age at diagnosis was 9.2 years (range, 2-14 years). Seven of the dogs were Cocker Spaniels. Five dogs had multiple mammary tumors. All tumors were benign. Twenty-six were simple adenomas with mixed acinar and papillary patterns. The acinar pattern was predominant in 17 cases. One adenoma was complex with a prominent myoepithelial component. The myoepithelial component of 25 of the 25 tumors was immunohistochemically positive for calponin and p63. In the cases for which relevant clinical information was available, there was no reported history of obesity, testicular tumors, or sex hormone therapy. Surgery was the only reported treatment for these tumors. Only 1 dog was reported to have developed an additional mammary tumor. None of the dogs for which case outcome was known died or was euthanatized as a result of mammary tumor. Although uncommon, mammary tumors do occur in male dogs. Although mammary tumors may be quite cellular, the presence of an intact myoepithelium, which can be demonstrated with immunohistochemistry for calponin and p63, indicates benignancy, as the clinical behavior documents.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tidholm, A</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Borgarelli, M</author><author>Tarducci, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

The aetiology of the myocardial hypokineis is seldom known in the individual case of DCM, although several theories concerning genetic, nutritional, metabolic, inflammatory, infectious, or drug- or toxin-induced myocardial disease have been discussed. DCM is often referred to as being breed-specific for Boxers, Doberman Pinschers, English Cocker Spaniels and other breeds. Review of reports on histopathologic findings in canine DCM reveals two histologically distinct forms of DCM; (1) cardiomyopathy of boxers and of Doberman pinschers, corresponding to the &quot;fatty infiltration-degenerative&quot; type, and (2) the form seen in many giant, large- and medium-sized breeds, including some boxers and Doberman pinschers, which can be classified as the &quot;attenuated wavy fiber&quot; type of DCM. The classification of canine idiopathic DCM according to histologic findigns seems superior to classification suggesting breed-specific syndromes, as some breeds (i.e. boxers and Doberman pinschers) may be affected by both diseases. However, ante mortem aetiological diagnosis of DCM is difficult. DCM carries a poor prognosis in dogs, and few prognostic indicators have been identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abraham, D</author><author>Blakemore, W F</author><author>Dell, A</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author><author>Jones, J</author><author>Littlewood, J T</author><author>Oates, J</author><author>Palmer, A C</author><author>Sidebotham, R</author><author>Winchester, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The enzymic defect and storage products in canine fucosidosis.</title><secondary-title>The Biochemical journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Biochemical journal</full-title></periodical><pages>25-33</pages><volume>222</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Carbohydrate Metabolism</keyword><keyword>Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors</keyword><keyword>Chemical Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Chemistry</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, Gel</keyword><keyword>Chromatography, Thin Layer</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fucose</keyword><keyword>Glycoside Hydrolases</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen-Ion Concentration</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mass Spectrometry</keyword><keyword>Oligosaccharides</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6477509</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1042/bj2220025</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A marked deficiency of alpha-L-fucosidase and the accumulation of  fucose-containing glycoasparagines were found in the brains of two English Springer spaniels suffering from a progressive nervous disorder.

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between sexual hormones and mammary gland tumors in a male dog. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old, intact male Cocker Spaniel presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Kangwon National University, Republic of Korea, with an acute right ruptured caudal abdominal mass. Physical examination revealed a 14 × 14 cm ruptured mass in the right caudal abdomen, as well as a 1.5 × 1.5 cm mass in the first right mammary gland. The estrogen and progesterone concentrations in serum were within normal levels. Total mastectomy was done on the right side mammary glands. Following surgery, the site was fully recovered; however, a mass that had grown to 2 × 2 cm was found in the left fifth mammary gland and a testis tumor was also found over the period of 4 months. Mastectomy was performed on the left caudal mammary gland and castration was also performed. After the final surgery, the dog fully recovered. Histopathological examination of all three masses revealed high grade mammary adenocarcinoma in the mammary gland and the testis was diagnosed as Leydig cell adenoma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the estrogen and progesterone receptors were expressed on limited cells in mammary and testis tumors. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that mammary tumors and testes tumors can occur in male dogs without relationship to female sexual hormone.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christiansen, Liselotte B</author><author>Reimann, Maria J</author><author>Schou-Pedersen, Anne Marie V</author><author>Larsen, Steen</author><author>Lykkesfeldt, Jens</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Depleted Myocardial Coenzyme Q10 in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with  Congestive Heart Failure Due to Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease.</title><secondary-title>Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33499156</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/antiox10020161</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been associated with depleted myocardial  coenzyme Q10 (Q10) concentrations in human patients. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between myocardial Q10 concentrations and myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) severity in dogs. Furthermore, citrate synthase (CS) activity was analysed to determine if a reduction in myocardial Q10 was associated with mitochondrial depletion in the myocardium. Thirty Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) in MMVD stages B1 (n = 11), B2 (n = 5) and C (n = 14) according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines and 10 control (CON) dogs of other breeds were included. Myocardial Q10 concentration was analysed in left ventricular tissue samples using HPLC-ECD. CKCS with congestive heart failure (CHF; group C) had significantly reduced Q10 concentrations (median, 1.54 µg/mg; IQR, 1.36-1.94), compared to B1 (2.76 µg/mg; 2.10-4.81, p &lt; 0.0018), B2 (3.85 µg/mg; 3.13-4.46, p &lt; 0.0054) and CON dogs (2.8 µg/mg; 1.64-4.88, p &lt; 0.0089). CS activity was comparable between disease groups. In conclusion, dogs with CHF due to MMVD had reduced myocardial Q10 concentrations. Studies evaluating antioxidant defense mechanisms as a therapeutic target for treatment of CHF in dogs are warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knowler, Susan P</author><author>Kiviranta, Anna-Mariam</author><author>McFadyen, Angus K</author><author>Jokinen, Tarja S</author><author>La Ragione, Roberto M</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Craniometric Analysis of the Hindbrain and Craniocervical Junction of Chihuahua,  Affenpinscher and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dogs With and Without Syringomyelia Secondary to Chiari-Like Malformation.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0169898</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cephalometry</keyword><keyword>Cervical Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Discriminant Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Rhombencephalon</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Skull Base</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28121988</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0169898</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To characterize and compare the phenotypic variables of the hindbrain  and craniocervical junction associated with syringomyelia (SM) in the Chihuahua, Affenpinscher and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS). METHOD: Analysis of 273 T1-weighted mid-sagittal DICOM sequences of the hindbrain and craniocervical junction from 99 Chihuahuas, 42 Affenpinschers and 132 CKCSs. The study compared 22 morphometric features (11 lines, eight angles and three ratios) of dogs with and without SM using refined techniques based on previous studies of the Griffon Bruxellois (GB) using Discriminant Function Analysis and ANOVA with post-hoc corrections. RESULTS: The analysis identified 14/22 significant traits for SM in the three dog breeds, five of which were identical to those reported for the GB and suggest inclusion of a common aetiology. One ratio, caudal fossa height to the length of the skull base extended to an imaginary point of alignment between the atlas and supraoccipital bones, was common to all three breeds (p values 0.029 to &lt;0.001). Associated with SM were a reduced occipital crest and two acute changes in angulation i) 'sphenoid flexure' at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis ii) 'cervical flexure' at the foramen magnum allied with medulla oblongata elevation. Comparing dogs with and without SM, each breed had a unique trait: Chihuahua had a smaller angle between the dens, atlas and basioccipital bone (p value &lt; 0.001); Affenpinschers had a smaller distance from atlas to dens (p value 0.009); CKCS had a shorter distance between the spheno-occipital synchondrosis and atlas (p value 0.007). CONCLUSION: The selected morphometries successfully characterised conformational changes in the brain and craniocervical junction that might form the basis of a diagnostic tool for all breeds. The severity of SM involved a spectrum of abnormalities, incurred by changes in both angulation and size that could alter neural parenchyma compliance and/or impede cerebrospinal fluid channels.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ling, G V</author><author>Ruby, A L</author><author>Johnson, D L</author><author>Thurmond, M</author><author>Franti, C E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Renal calculi in dogs and cats: prevalence, mineral type, breed, age, and gender  interrelationships (1981-1993).</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>11-21</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Distribution</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Databases, Factual</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Kidney Calculi</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Minerals</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Sex Distribution</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>growth &amp; development</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9503355</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.1998.tb00491.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Three hundred seventeen specimens of urinary calculi of renal origin from 214  female dogs and 103 male dogs, and 71 specimens of urinary calculi of renal origin from 38 female cats and 33 male cats were submitted for mineral analysis between July 1, 1981, and December 31, 1993. Among dogs, 45 breeds were affected with renal calculi. Thirty-three breeds and a crossbred group were represented among females, but 8 breeds and the crossbred group accounted for 81% of the total. Among male dogs, 30 breeds and a crossbred group were represented, but 7 breeds and the crossbred group accounted for 69% of the total. Among cats, 10 breeds and a crossbred group were represented. Dogs and cats with renal calculi were older than those of 2 comparison population groups. More than one-half of the renal calculi in both dogs and cats were from the 1st known episode of urolithiasis. The risk of formation of renal calculi was found to be higher for cats than for dogs, when compared to other stone-forming cats and dogs (approximately 4.95 per 100 stone-forming cats and 2.88 per 100 stone-forming dogs). Among dogs, breeds at highest risk of developing renal calculi were Miniature Schnauzers, Shih Tzus, Lhasa Aposos, Yorkshire Terriers, and female Pugs. Also at high risk were male Dalmatians and male Basset Hounds. Among small dogs, females generally were at higher risk of developing renal calculi than were males. Regardless of size, terrier breed males generally were at higher risk of developing renal calculi. Breeds of dogs at low risk for development of renal calculi included crossbreds. German Shepherd Dogs, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and female Dachshunds. When only 1 kidney was involved, the risk of left renal calculus was greatest for both dogs and cats, but bilateral renal involvement was relatively common in both species (19% and 9%, respectively). Among dogs, specimens composed of 1 mineral substance (e.g., struvite) occurred more often in males (58.3%) than in females (37.9%). Female dogs formed renal calculi containing struvite or oxalate more often than did males; males formed calculi containing urate more often than did females. Calculi containing oxalate, apatite, or some combination of these minerals predominated among cats; only 1 specimen from 38 female cats and only 4 specimens from 33 male cats contained neither oxalate nor apatite. Crossbred cats were significantly less likely to have renal calculi than were other breeds. A single renal calculus specimen was identified in several uncommon breeds including Tonkinese and Birman cats, and Affenpinscher, Clumber Spaniel, English Shepherd, and Field Spaniel dogs. No significant differences were observed between male and female dogs or between male and female cats with regard to mineral type of the specimen and the presence of urinary tract infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sarenbo, Sirkku L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canines seized by the Swedish Police Authority in 2015-2016.</title><secondary-title>Forensic science international</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forensic science international</full-title></periodical><pages>101-109</pages><volume>296</volume><keywords><keyword>Aggression</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Behavior, Animal</keyword><keyword>Bites and Stings</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ownership</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>legislation &amp; jurisprudence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30711844</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.013</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The inspection protocols of the Swedish police, based on the Act (2007:1150) on  Supervision of Dogs and Cats, were used to examine the characteristics of 101 seized dogs, their owners, and the circumstances in which the attacks occurred. Most common reasons to seize a dog was that the dog owner was not following a previous order or ban, or that the dog had attacked and caused damage to humans or animals. The most common circumstances of the attacks involved dogs that escaped from gardens, unleashed dogs on walks and attacks by dogs on a leash. Bull breeds caused the highest number of injuries, the most serious injuries, and they were most often categorized as high risk, followed by Rottweilers and German Shepherds. Affenpinscher, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, Japanese Spitz, Pug, Shih Tzu, Shetland Sheepdog and Golden Retriever were identified as victim breeds.

The dog had two left forelimb paws, both originating from the carpus, with symmetrical duplication of metacarpal bones and phalanges. In addition, the left radial head was subluxated and asynchronous growth of the left radius and ulna was noted. The PS walkway demonstrated minimal weight-bearing of the extra (medial) paw and longer metacarpal pad contact of the affected limb. The radiographic changes and the weight-bearing pattern during gait suggested that more weight was loaded on the lateral paw of the affected limb. Treatment was not recommended because of the relatively good limb function and the absence of overt pain. This is the first reported case of canine dimelia and foot pressure patterns in a canine congenital musculoskeletal deformity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gnudi, G</author><author>Martini, F M</author><author>Zanichelli, S</author><author>Volta, A</author><author>Bertoni, G</author><author>Del Bue, M</author><author>Borghetti, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incomplete humeral condylar fracture in two English Pointer dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>243-245</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Screws</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Stress, Mechanical</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16594393</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Incomplete humeral condylar fracture was diagnosed by means of radiology, CT,  scintigraphy, arthroscopy and bone biopsy in two English Pointer dogs. In both cases an acute thoracic limb lameness, unrelated to a known episode of major trauma, was observed. Incomplete humeral condylar fracture, mainly described in the Spaniel breeds, has been recently diagnosed in Labrador retrievers, Rottweiler, German Wachtel and other breeds. The pathogenesis of the condition is still unknown, but incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle and mechanical stress, alone or associated, have to be considered. However, our clinical and histopathological data lead us to believe that in Pointers, high performance dogs, the mechanical stress can assume a critical ethiopathogenetic role.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horn, B</author><author>Irwin, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transient hypoparathyroidism following successful treatment of hypercalcaemia of  malignancy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>690-692</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypercalcemia</keyword><keyword>Hypoparathyroidism</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin</keyword><keyword>Parathyroid Hormone</keyword><keyword>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11098384</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2000.tb10407.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 4-year-old, entire female, English Cocker Spaniel was presented for treatment  of lymphosarcoma and secondary hypercalcaemia.

This study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics of repeated oral dosing of Q10 in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with spontaneous myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and to evaluate echocardiographic parameters, circulating cardiac biomarkers, and quality of life (QoL) after treatment. The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded crossover study. Nineteen CKCS with MMVD were randomized to receive 100 mg Q10 (ubiquinone) bi-daily for three weeks, then placebo (or in reverse order). Clinical examination, blood sampling, echocardiography, and QoL assessment were performed before and after each treatment phase. Q10 plasma concentrations were determined in plasma using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method using electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Eighteen CKCS were included in the analyses. Total plasma concentration of Q10 increased significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) from baseline (median, 0.92 µg/mL; interquartile range (IQR), 0.70-1.26) to after treatment (median, 3.51 µg/mL; IQR, 2.30-6.88). Thirteen dogs reached the threshold of a total plasma Q10 concentration of ≥2.0 µg/mL. The average half-life (T(1/2)) of Q10 was 2.95 days (IQR, 1.75-4.02). No significant differences were observed in clinical MMVD severity, and the owner perceived QoL between Q10 and placebo treatment. The solubilized Q10 formulation was well-tolerated in the dogs. Individual variation in plasma concentrations was observed following oral treatment. A long-term placebo-controlled trial is warranted in dogs with MMVD to determine long-term efficacy on the clinical severity of MMVD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graham, K J</author><author>Black, A P</author><author>Brain, P H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resolution of life-threatening dysphagia caused by caudal occipital malformation  syndrome following foramen magnum decompressive surgery.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>297-300</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Deglutition Disorders</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Occipital Bone</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22827623</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2012.00952.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was presented with acute onset, life-threatening  dysphagia suspected to be secondary to medulla oblongata compression caused by caudal occipital malformation syndrome. The patient required urgent tracheostomy tube placement to remain stable and was subsequently cured of the presenting neurological deficits by foramen magnum decompressive surgery. Neurogenic dysphagia is a relatively common presenting sign in human Chiari malformation syndromes, but has not been described as a major clinical sign in veterinary patients. Caudal occipital malformation syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis list for susceptible breeds presenting with dysphagia. Early recognition favours expeditious surgical intervention and a positive outcome in human patients, and this may also be the case in veterinary patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mylonakis, Mathios E</author><author>Kritsepi-Konstantinou, Maria</author><author>Vernau, William</author><author>Valli, Victor E</author><author>Pardali, Dimitra</author><author>Koutinas, Alexander F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presumptive pure erythroid leukemia in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</full-title></periodical><pages>1004-1007</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Leukemia</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22807506</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1040638712452731</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6.5-year-old, intact male Cocker Spaniel dog was referred with a history of  depression and anorexia of 1-week duration.

Bone marrow aspirate cytology indicated that individual particles were composed of approximately 60% hematopoietic cells and a monomorphic population of blast cells with perfectly round nuclei, consistent paranuclear clearing, and deeply basophilic cytoplasm devoid of granules dominating the marrow fields. The granulocytic lineage was severely decreased with a granulocytic-to-erythroid ratio of 0.15 and a blast cell percentage of at least 70% of all nucleated cells; the myeloblasts and monoblasts composed &lt;5% of nonerythroid cells. Bone marrow cytology slides were submitted for immunocytochemical immunophenotyping using antibodies to myeloperoxidase, cluster of differentiation (CD)3, CD79a, CD11b, CD45, and CD34.

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical report. ANIMALS: A 1-year-old, male castrated Springer spaniel dog. METHODS: With the dog in sternal recumbency, an extraoral (dorsal) approach to the nose was performed, and after surgical margins were outlined, a Y-shaped skin incision was made to remove redundant tissue and expose the bifid nasal cartilages. The cartilages were opposed and sutured together and the skin closed in 2 layers. The dog was repositioned in dorsal recumbency, and the 2 maxillary first incisor teeth were extracted. After tangential incision and undermining of the cleft defect, the mucosa was sutured in 1 layer. RESULTS: Healing was uneventful and there was an immediate return to normal function. At 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months function was excellent without further clinical signs. CONCLUSION: Bifid nose associated with a cleft of the primary palate can be surgically corrected.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riedinger, B</author><author>Albaric, O</author><author>Gauthier, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cholesterol granuloma as long-term complication of total ear canal ablation in a  dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>188-191</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ear Diseases</keyword><keyword>Ear, Middle</keyword><keyword>Granuloma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Osteotomy</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22122350</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2011.01157.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 13-year-old cocker spaniel presented with pain on opening the mouth.

The mite is living on the epidermal surface of auditory canal without burrowing into the tissue and feeding on tissue fluids and debris. In most of the cases they induce hypersensitivity reactions in the host. Four puppies; Siberian husky, Cocker spaniel, Terrier and mixed Pekignese with different genders and ages were referred to the Small Animal Hospital, Veterinary Faculty of Tehran University, Tehran, Iran for routine clinical examination just after they were imported from Thailand in a timeframe between June to August 2008.Clinical examinations showed an excessive dark brown discharge in both ears. No signs of other clinical situations were observed. White moving mites were seen during otoscopy examination, the specimen of ear discharge was sent to parasitology laboratory for precise identification of genus and species. Mites were identified as Otodectes cynotis and the presence of concurrent yeast and bacterial infection was showed by laboratory examinations. Topical Amitraz solution in combination with otic antibacterial and antifungal agents were administered as the treatment. Since, all the reported cases were imported from Thailand, careful clinical examination and quarantine strategies are highly recommended at the borders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schick, R O</author><author>Fadok, V A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Responses of atopic dogs to regional allergens: 268 cases (1981-1984).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1493-1496</pages><volume>189</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Allergens</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Atopic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Skin Tests</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><accession-num>3804851</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Responses of atopic dogs to intradermal challenge with 60 allergens were  determined and compared for 4 regions of the United States Twenty-seven allergens incited significantly higher responses in atopic dogs residing in northern Florida, when compared with dogs in Illinois; responses to 28 allergens were more significant in dogs residing in southern Florida vs Illinois.

Of the atopic dogs evaluated in Florida, 79% had a significant response to flea antigen, compared with only 9% of atopic dogs evaluated in Illinois.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reimann, M J</author><author>Møller, J E</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Martinussen, T</author><author>Zatrazemi, S S C</author><author>Svanholm, L</author><author>Nielsen, L B M</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitral Regurgitation Severity and Left Ventricular Systolic Dimension Predict  Survival in Young Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1008-1016</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Systole</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Dysfunction, Left</keyword><keyword>diagnostic  imaging</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28573754</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.14759</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Development and progression of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD)  in dogs are difficult to predict. Identification at a young age of dogs at high risk of adverse outcome in the future is desirable. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To study the predictive value of selected clinical and echocardiographic characteristics associated with MMVD obtained at a young age for prediction of long-term cardiac and all-cause mortality in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). ANIMALS: 1125 privately owned CKCS. METHODS: A retrospective study including CKCS examined at the age of 1-3 years. Long-term outcome was assessed by telephone interview with owners. The value of variables for predicting mortality was investigated by Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: Presence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.03, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.48-6.23, P = 0.0025) even intermittent moderate to severe MR (HR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.48-6.23, P = 0.039) on color flow Doppler echocardiography was significantly associated with increased hazard of cardiac death. An interaction between MR and sex was significant for all-cause mortality (P = 0.035), showing that males with moderate to severe MR had a higher all-cause mortality compared to males with no MR (HR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.27-4.49, P = 0.0071), whereas no difference was found between female MR groups. The risk of cardiac (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14-1.63, P &lt; 0.001) and all-cause (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.24, P = 0.016) mortality increased with increasing left ventricular end-systolic internal dimension normalized for body weight (LVIDS(N) ). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Moderate to severe MR, even if intermittent, and increased LVIDS(N) in dogs &lt;3 years of age were associated with cardiac death later in life in CKCS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mattox, Taylor A</author><author>Young, Martin E</author><author>Rubel, Carrie E</author><author>Spaniel, Carolyn</author><author>Rodríguez, Jessica E</author><author>Grevengoed, Trisha J</author><author>Gautel, Mathias</author><author>Xu, Zhelong</author><author>Anderson, Ethan J</author><author>Willis, Monte S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Erratum to: MuRF1 activity is present in cardiac mitochondria and regulates  reactive oxygen species production in vivo.</title><secondary-title>Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes</full-title></periodical><pages>281</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25515723</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10863-014-9597-1</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olivieri, Lara</author><author>Nardini, Giordano</author><author>Pengo, Graziano</author><author>Abramo, Francesca</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cutaneous progressive angiomatosis on the muzzle of a dog, treated by laser  photocoagulation therapy.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>517-521</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiomatosis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Laser Coagulation</keyword><keyword>Nose Diseases</keyword><keyword>Skin Diseases</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20456721</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-3164.2010.00883.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 10-year old, female, cocker spaniel was presented with a bleeding lesion on the  muzzle and nasal planum observed initially as a small raised nodule at 1 year of age. This became clinically more pronounced at 5 years of age, progressively enlarged thereafter and was diagnosed initially as a vascular tumour. On clinical examination, multiple confluent nodules of variable diameter (0.5-1.5 cm) deformed the outline of the nose. Histological examination revealed a progressive angiomatosis with multifocal infiltrative growth of increased dermal vascularization with different sized and type of anastomosing vessels lined by a monolayer of reactive endothelium, often arranged as papillary projections into the lumina. Partial nosectomy, the first therapeutic approach, was unsuccessful and the lesion relapsed within 6 months. However, subsequent laser photocoagulation therapy provided a good cosmetic outcome, no relapse 1 year later, and appeared to provide an effective alternative to ablation surgery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, Kechia M</author><author>Spaulding, Kathy A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imaging diagnosis: biliopleural fistula in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>70-72</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biliary Fistula</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gallbladder</keyword><keyword>Lung Injury</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pleural Effusion</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Tract Fistula</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>Wounds, Gunshot</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15005364</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2004.04011.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-year-old intact male Brittany Spaniel was admitted for thoracic gunshot  wounds. Despite continued supportive care, the dog's condition deteriorated. Thoracic/abdominal ultrasound revealed a biliopleural fistula. Following fistula repair, the dog made a complete recovery. This case represented a diagnostic challenge because of the uncommon clinical presentation of a severe bile pleuritis in the absence of significant bile peritonitis. Biliopleural fistula is a rare condition but should be considered as a differential diagnosis in trauma patients with pleural effusion, especially those with penetrating thoracic injuries. Ultrasonography can be used to diagnose this disorder preoperatively.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Garosi, Laurent S</author><author>Penderis, Jacques</author><author>Brearley, Malcom J</author><author>Brearley, Jacky C</author><author>Dennis, Ruth</author><author>Kirkpatrick, P J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intraventricular tension pneumocephalus as a complication of transfrontal  craniectomy: a case report.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary surgery : VS</full-title></periodical><pages>226-231</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Ventricles</keyword><keyword>Craniotomy</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fistula</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Meningeal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Meningioma</keyword><keyword>Pneumocephalus</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11994849</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/jvet.2002.32449</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To report the diagnosis and surgical treatment of a case of  intraventricular tension pneumocephalus in a dog after a transfrontal craniectomy for removal of a falx cerebri meningioma.

Medical dissolution of struvite uroliths with a Swedish calculolythic diet has been evaluated. The palatability of the diet was good and only two out of a total of 69 dogs in the study could not be maintained on the diet because of diarrhea. In 19 of 33 dogs medically treated, the uroliths were dissolved over a period of one to 6 months (mean time 2.5 months). In the remaining dogs uroliths were surgically removed, and calculolytic diet was postoperatively given. Consumption of the calculolytic diet was in most cases associated with a lowered specific gravity and pH of the urine. A representative case report of medical dissolution of struvite uroliths located in the urinary bladder of a 9 year-old female cocker spaniel with a history of recurrent urolithiasis is described. It is concluded that the Swedish calculolytic diet can be used successfully to dissolve struvite in adults dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strohmeier, Ulrike W</author><author>Harris, Karen P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Humeral intracondylar fissures in French bulldogs.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>e504</pages><volume>189</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34021603</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vetr.504</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: French bulldogs have previously been reported to be at an increased  risk of developing humeral condylar fractures (HCF). Humeral intracondylar fissures (HIF) are thought to be a predisposing factor for HCF occurrence in skeletally mature dogs particularly when the fracture occurs during normal activity. We hypothesised that HIF may be a predisposing factor for HCF in French bulldogs. METHODS: A retrospective case series of nine French bulldogs that had sustained HCF and where CT was performed prior to surgery. RESULTS: Five of the fractured humeri had sclerosis adjacent to the fracture site. Six of the contralateral intact humeri were diagnosed with HIF on the basis of a partial (2/6) or complete (4/6) hypoattenuating area extending between the distal articular surface and the supratrochlear foramen in the sagittal plane, with adjacent sclerosis (6/6). CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of sclerosis at the intracondylar fracture surface on CT can prompt suspicion that HIF preceded HCF. A predisposing HIF has potentially great clinical significance for this breed if we draw parallels with breeds such as the springer spaniel for whom HIF and HIF-associated condylar fracture is well documented.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mann, Thais R</author><author>Cadore, Gustavo C</author><author>Camillo, Giovana</author><author>Vogel, Fernanda S F</author><author>Schmidt, Claudete</author><author>Andrade, Cinthia M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine cutaneous neosporosis in Brazil.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>195-197</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26949109</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vde.12294</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The clinical signs of infection in dogs with Neospora caninum are usually  associated with neurological disorders and are seen in young dogs.

Infection with N. caninum was diagnosed on the basis of cytology and examination of skin tissues by PCR. The dog initially responded to treatment with clindamycin and then relapsed; the dog died. Infection with N. caninum may have been due in part to immune suppression due to hyperadrenocorticism; which either allowed for the development of a primary infection or reactivation of a latent infection by N. caninum with the occurrence of skin lesions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Armstrong, Pedro F</author><author>Sigler, Lynne</author><author>Sutton, Deanna A</author><author>Grooters, Amy M</author><author>Hitt, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fungal myelitis caused by Phialosimplex caninus in an immunosuppressed dog.</title><secondary-title>Medical mycology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical mycology</full-title></periodical><pages>509-512</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Amphotericin B</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antifungal Agents</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eurotiales</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunocompromised Host</keyword><keyword>Itraconazole</keyword><keyword>Myelitis</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22122265</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/13693786.2011.633106</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A bone marrow infection caused by Phialosimplex caninus was diagnosed in a  seven-year-old female spayed Cocker Spaniel that was receiving prednisone for autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

The dilated lymphatic channels were lined by a single layer of flattened, discontinuous endothelium with scattered intraluminal valves. Periodic acid-Schiff staining highlighted the discontinuous basement membrane and immunohistochemistry revealed strong cell membrane and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for CD31 and von Willebrand factor, respectively.

Ejaculates of semen collected from affected dogs had reduced total sperm output and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. A high proportion of ejaculated spermatozoa had midpiece droplets, bent tails and poor motility. Severely vacuolated epididymal epithelial cells were observed by light microscopy. Electron microscopic examination revealed membrane-bound vacuoles of variable size containing scanty amounts of granular to fibrillar material in epididymal epithelial cells, smooth muscle, myoid cells and Sertoli cells. Male infertility is believed to result from lysosomal storage of fucosyl-linked substrates in cells of the reproductive system. The extensive lesions in the epididymis may have interfered with maturation and transport of spermatozoa. Also, deficiency of alpha-L-fucosidase activity could have impaired the shedding of cytoplasmic droplets from spermatozoa and altered the surface glycoprotein composition of the sperm during epididymal transit.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eriksson, Anders S</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik Duelund</author><author>Hansson, Kerstin</author><author>Järvinen, Anna-Kaisa</author><author>Haukka, Jari</author><author>Kvart, Clarence</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increased NT-proANP predicts risk of congestive heart failure in Cavalier King  Charles spaniels with mitral regurgitation caused by myxomatous valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>141-154</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrial Natriuretic Factor</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Diseases, X-Linked</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal Studies</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Proportional Hazards Models</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25130405</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2014.05.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive value of plasma N-terminal pro-atrial  natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and nitric oxide end-products (NOx) as markers for progression of mitral regurgitation caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease. ANIMALS: Seventy-eight privately owned Cavalier King Charles spaniels with naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study comprising 312 measurements over a 4.5 year period. Clinical values were recorded, NT-proANP concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and NOx were analyzed colorimetrically. To predict congestive heart failure (CHF), Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates were constructed. RESULTS: The hazard ratio for NT-proANP (per 1000 pmol/l increase) to predict future CHF was 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-12.5; p &lt; 0.001). The median time to CHF for dogs with NT-proANP levels &gt;1000 pmol/l was 11 months (95% confidence interval, 5.6-12.6 months), compared to 54 months (46 - infinity) for dogs with concentrations ≤ 1000 pmol/l (p &lt; 0.001). Due to intra- and inter-individual variability, most corresponding analyses for NOx were insignificant but dogs reaching CHF had a lower mean NOx concentration than dogs not reaching CHF (23 vs. 28 μmol/l, p = 0.016). Risk of CHF increased with increase in heart rate (&gt;130 beats per minute) and grade of murmur (≥ 3/6). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CHF due to mitral regurgitation is increased in dogs with blood NT-proANP concentrations above 1000 pmol/l. Measurement of NT-proANP can be a valuable tool to identify dogs that may develop CHF within months.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pápa, Kinga</author><author>Máthé, Akos</author><author>Abonyi-Tóth, Zsolt</author><author>Sterczer, Agnes</author><author>Psáder, Roland</author><author>Hetyey, Csaba</author><author>Vajdovich, Péter</author><author>Vörös, Károly</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Occurrence, clinical features and outcome of canine pancreatitis (80 cases).</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</full-title></periodical><pages>37-52</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Pancreatitis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21354940</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1556/AVet.59.2011.1.4</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Medical records of 80 dogs diagnosed with acute pancreatitis during a 4-year  period were evaluated regarding history, breed predilection, clinical signs and additional examination findings. Cases were selected if compatible clinical symptoms, increased serum activity of amylase or lipase and morphologic evidence of pancreatitis by ultrasonography, laparotomy or necropsy were all present. Like in other studies, neutered dogs had an increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Although breed predilection was consistent with earlier reports, some notable differences were also observed. Apart from Dachshunds, Poodles, Cocker Spaniels and Fox Terriers, the sled dogs (Laikas, Alaskan Malamutes) also demonstrated a higher risk for pancreatitis according to our results. Concurrent diseases occurred in 56 dogs (70%), diabetes mellitus (n = 29, 36%) being the most common. Clinical signs of acute pancreatitis were similar to those observed in other studies. The study group represented a dog population with severe acute pancreatitis, having a relatively high mortality rate (40%) compared to data of the literature. Breed, age, gender, neutering and body condition had no significant association with the outcome. Hypothermia (p = 0.0413) and metabolic acidosis (p = 0.0063) correlated significantly with poor prognosis and may serve as valuable markers for severity assessment in canine acute pancreatitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charlesworth, T M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk factors for postoperative complications following bilateral closed anal  sacculectomy in the dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>350-354</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Anal Sacs</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Surgery, Veterinary</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24702484</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12217</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To report the complication rate for bilateral closed anal  sacculectomy in the dog and to evaluate potential risk factors for the development of postoperative complications. To identify breed groups at risk of requiring anal sacculectomy. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of dogs undergoing bilateral closed anal sacculectomy between 2003 and 2013. RESULTS: Sixty-two dogs were included in the study of which 32·3% developed mild and self-limiting complications including 14·5% dogs that experienced postoperative defaecatory complications. No dog developed permanent faecal incontinence. Dogs less than 15 kg bodyweight were more likely to develop postoperative complications. Dogs that used gel to distend the anal sac were more likely to have postoperative complications than those that did not. Previous abscess formation, recurrent disease and pretreatment with antibiotics had no significant effect on postoperative complication rates. Cavalier King Charles spaniels and Labrador-type dogs were over-represented within this study population. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Anal sacculectomy is a safe procedure with a relatively high rate of short-term but self-limiting, minor, postoperative complications. Smaller (&lt;15 kg) dogs are more likely to experience postoperative complications but the risk of permanent faecal incontinence is low.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarpataki, Noémi</author><author>Pápa, Kinga</author><author>Reiczigel, J</author><author>Vajdovich, P</author><author>Vörösi, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and features of canine atopic dermatitis in Hungary.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</full-title></periodical><pages>353-366</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis, Atopic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hungary</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Skin Tests</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>17020139</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1556/AVet.54.2006.3.6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Medical records of 600 dogs diagnosed with atopic dermatitis were reviewed and  evaluated with reference to history, geographical distribution, breed predilection, clinical signs and positive reactions to allergens as determined by intradermal skin testing (IDT) manufactured by Artuvetrin Laboratories. In 66.6% of dogs, the age of onset of atopic dermatitis was between 4 months and 3 years. Dogs living in the garden suburb of Budapest were more sensitive to house dust mites, fleas and moulds, and dogs from the western part of Hungary were more sensitive to weeds than to other allergens (p &lt; 0.01). Positive reactions were most common to Dermatophagoides farinae followed by human dander. The breed distribution found in the present study was consistent with that reported in the literature, except for the breeds Hungarian Vizsla, Pumi, French bulldog, Doberman Pinscher and Bobtail which were over-represented among atopic dogs compared to the breed distribution of the general dog population of a large city in Hungary. Breeds with verified adverse reaction to food were Cocker spaniels, French bulldogs, Bullmastiffs, Bull terriers, St. Bernards, Tervurens, West Highland White terriers and American Staffordshire terriers (p &lt; 0.05). The clinical signs of atopic dermatitis and their occurrence are in accordance with the data described in the literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saijonmaa-Koulumies, L E M</author><author>Myllys, V</author><author>Lloyd, D H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diversity and stability of the Staphylococcus intermedius flora in three bitches  and their puppies.</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and infection</full-title></periodical><pages>931-937</pages><volume>131</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Complications, Infectious</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>transmission</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>14596535</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s0950268803008938</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The study investigated the transfer and the stability of the S. intermedius flora  in three bitches and their puppies.

The isolates were genotyped with random amplified polymeric DNA-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RAPD-PCR) using two primers. Seventeen different genotypes of S. intermedius were identified. One or two of the genotypes were dominant in each of the bitches and their puppies. The rest were isolated only once or twice from the bitches or their puppies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis from 2009 to 2016 at six specialist referral centres were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The study included 49 dogs. Springer spaniels appeared to be over-represented (16 of 49 dogs). Young dogs (median age: 3 years and 9 months) and females (31 of 49) were frequently affected. Clinical presentation was variable, with pyrexia (39 of 49), lethargy (35 of 49) and anorexia (21 of 49) the most commonly reported clinical signs. Lymph node cytology or histopathology demonstrated neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous, granulomatous or necrotising lymphadenitis without a detectable underlying cause in all cases. Because a sterile immune-mediated aetiology was suspected, all dogs received prednisolone, which was followed by rapid resolution of clinical signs and lymphadenopathy in most cases. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis should be considered in dogs with pyrexia of unknown origin with inflammatory lymphadenopathy if no underlying cause can be found and often responds well to immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, L G</author><author>Tarnow, I</author><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Teerlink, T</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Body size, but neither age nor asymptomatic mitral regurgitation, influences  plasma concentrations of dimethylarginines in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>336-342</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arginine</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Creatinine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Linear Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16182327</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rvsc.2005.07.005</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a marker of various cardiovascular diseases  in man.

Seventy-six dogs were included (44 CKCS and 32 dogs of other breeds). The CKCS had various degrees of MR, whereas the remaining dogs had either no or minimal MR. Apart from cardiac murmurs, no dogs showed signs of cardiac or systematic disease. The degree of MR had no significant influence on ADMA (P = 0.33). Body weight was directly associated with ADMA (P = 0.0004) and creatinine was directly associated with SDMA (P&lt;0.0001).

S. intermedius showed significantly greater adherence to the head and neck compared with the dorsum, but adherence to the limb, axilla and groin did not differ from other sites. Furthermore, there was significantly greater adherence of S. intermedius to corneocytes from the dorsum, forelimb, axilla and groin of Boxers and Bull Terriers than Spaniels and Hounds. S. intermedius, and also Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibited abundant adherence, which was significantly greater than Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus canis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. In addition, S. intermedius adherence demonstrated a sigmoid dose-response curve with increasing bacterial concentration. These results suggest that S. intermedius adheres to canine corneocytes by a specific receptor-ligand interaction and adheres to the skin of some breeds more avidly than others. However, variations in adherence between body regions would not account for the predilection sites of canine bacterial pyoderma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrade, Larissa R</author><author>Caceres, Amanda M</author><author>Trecenti, Anelize S</author><author>Brandão, Claudia Valeria S</author><author>Gandolfi, Micaella G</author><author>Aguiar, Evian V</author><author>Andrade, Danilo G A</author><author>Borges, Alexandre S</author><author>Oliveira-Filho, Jose P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allele Frequency of the C.5G&gt;A Mutation in the PRCD Gene Responsible for  Progressive Retinal Atrophy in English Cocker Spaniel Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animals : an open access journal from MDPI</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31640229</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ani9100844</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) due to the c.5G&gt;A mutation in the progressive  rod-cone degeneration (PRCD) gene is an important genetic disease in English cocker spaniel (ECS) dogs. Because the prevalence of this disease has not been verified in Brazil, this study aimed to evaluate the allele frequency of the c.5G&gt;A mutation in the PRCD gene. Purified DNA from 220 ECS dogs was used for genotyping, of which 131 were registered from 18 different kennels and 89 were unregistered. A clinical eye examination was performed in 28 of the genotyped animals; 10 were homozygous mutants. DNA fragments containing the mutation region were amplified by PCR and subjected to direct genomic sequencing. The prcd-PRA allele frequency was 25.5%. Among the registered dogs, the allele frequency was 14.9%; among the dogs with no history of registration, the allele frequency was 41%. Visual impairment was observed in 80% (8/10) of the homozygous mutant animals that underwent clinical eye examination. The high mutation frequency found in this study emphasizes the importance of genotyping ECSs as an early diagnostic test, especially as part of an informed breeding program, to avoid clinical cases of PRA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bexfield, Nicholas H</author><author>Watson, Penny J</author><author>Aguirre-Hernandez, Jesús</author><author>Sargan, David R</author><author>Tiley, Laurence</author><author>Heeney, Jonathan L</author><author>Kennedy, Lorna J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DLA class II alleles and haplotypes are associated with risk for and protection  from chronic hepatitis in the English Springer spaniel.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e42584</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis, Infectious Canine</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class II</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>immunology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22870335</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0042584</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chronic hepatitis (CH) is common in dogs in the United Kingdom. An increased  prevalence of the disease is seen in the English Springer spaniel (ESS), and this breed suffer from a severe form with young to middle aged female dogs being predisposed. The disease shares histological features with those of human viral hepatitis, although the specific aetiological agent has not yet been identified. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II alleles and haplotypes are associated with susceptibility/resistance to CH in the ESS. Sequence-based genotyping of the polymorphic exon 2 from DLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 class II loci were performed in 66 ESSs with CH and 84 healthy controls. There was a significant difference in the distribution of the protective alleles DRB1*00501 (3.0% vs. 12.0%, odds ratio [OR] = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06-0.74) and DQB1*00501 (3.8% vs. 12.0%, OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09-0.85) between cases and controls. The haplotype DLA-DRB1*00501/DQA1*00301/DQB1*00501 was present in 11.9% of controls and 3.0% of cases and was significantly associated with protection against disease development (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.08-0.80). There was a significant difference in the distribution of the risk alleles DRB1*00601 (14.4% vs. 6.5%, OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.10-5.63) and DQB1*00701 (14.4% vs. 6.5%, OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.10-5.63) between cases and controls. A risk haplotype (DLA-DRB1*00601/DQA1*005011/DQB1*00701) was present in 14.4% of cases and 6.5% of controls and conferred an elevated risk of developing CH with an OR of 3.13 (95% CI = 1.20-8.26). These results demonstrate that DLA class II is significantly associated with risk and protection from developing CH in ESSs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thejll Kirchhoff, K</author><author>Goericke-Pesch, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in serum progesterone concentrations in Bernese mountain dogs and  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels during pregnancy.</title><secondary-title>Theriogenology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theriogenology</full-title></periodical><pages>1850-1855.e1</pages><volume>86</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy, Animal</keyword><keyword>Progesterone</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27402086</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.06.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progesterone (P4) concentrations during canine pregnancy follow a specific  pattern. Although the general pattern is similar, it is likely that breed-specific differences exist. Detailed knowledge about the physiological range of P4 concentrations may be helpful in cases of suspected hypoluteoidism. The aim of this study was to investigate P4 changes during pregnancy in a small and a large breed, to obtain reference values for specific intervals during pregnancy and to test for breed- or body weight-specific differences. We studied P4 concentrations in pregnancies from healthy Bernese mountain dogs (BMDs, n = 6) and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs, n = 6) with a normal reproductive history. Blood samples for P4 were taken to determine the day of ovulation and after confirmation of pregnancy in regular intervals from Days 23 to 29 to Days 60 to 64. Bernese mountain dogs delivered 6.2 ± 2.6 puppies (range: 3-9) 63.4 ± 1.5 (range: 61-65) days after ovulation (excluding data from one BMD with elective c-section) and CKCS delivered 3.3 ± 1.9 puppies (range: 1-5) 63.5 ± 1.1 (range: 62-65) days after ovulation. In general, the P4 concentrations of individual dogs continuously decreased from the first to the last sampling during pregnancy. Respective mean concentrations were Days 23 to 29: 19.2 ± 4.3/22.2 ± 3.9 ng/mL (BMD/CKCS), Days 30 to 34: 15.6 ± 2.3/17.7 ± 5.8 ng/mL, Days 35 to 39: 12.5 ± 2.8/14.1 ± 3.4 ng/mL, Days 40 to 44: 8.9 ± 1.4/11.8 ± 3.7 ng/mL, Days 45 to 49: 7.7 ± 1.6/8.9 ± 1.9 ng/mL, Days 50 to 54: 6.0 ± 1.3/8.7 ± 7.1 ng/mL, Days 55 to 59: 4.7 ± 1.2/5.3 ± 2.8 ng/mL, and Days 60 to 64: 3.69 ± 1.86/2.62 ± 0.42 ng/mL. ANOVA indicated significant differences over time within each breed when considered individually (P &lt; 0.0001 each), but not between breeds although mean P4 was slightly lower in BMD until Days 55 to 59. The present data clearly confirm the previously described P4 pattern during canine pregnancy with highest P4 concentrations obtained in the first interval (Days 23-29) and a subsequent decrease of P4. The lack of a significant rapid prepartal P4 drop might be related to methodological issues (time of last collection in regards to parturition). Other than expected, we failed to proof significant differences in P4 between CKCS and BMD. Further studies are required to confirm the results on a larger population of both breeds, but also other large-sized breeds to test for the hypothesis if BMD might have lower P4 concentrations and smaller litter size compared to other large breeds with larger litter size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Labrador, Jose</author><author>Witte, Philip Georg</author><author>Holdsworth, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of an extended CT scale reconstruction to diagnose metal implant failure in a  canine elbow.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>e63-e66</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Elbow</keyword><keyword>Fractures, Bone</keyword><keyword>Humerus</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32342576</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vru.12864</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A Cocker Spaniel presented for recurrence of right forelimb lameness 33 months  following transcondylar screw placement for a humeral intracondylar fissure.

Laboratory abnormalities included leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Gastroscopy and ultrasonography revealed multiple gastric masses and a possible pancreatic mass, respectively. Examination of tissues obtained at necropsy showed a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with hepatic metastasis, gastric hypertrophy, and multiple duodenal ulcers. Immunocytochemical staining of the neoplasia was positive for pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and insulin and negative for gastrin, calcitonin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serotonin, L-enkephalin, chromagranin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Subsequent serum gastrin and PP assays showed a fasting hypergastrinemia with a normal response of gastrin to provocative testing and extremely increased PP values. The high PP values may have resulted in the vomiting and gastrointestinal ulceration.

These general characteristics suggest etiological factors similar to those responsible for hormone-related neoplasms occurring in human beings. Perianal gland tumors appear to be androgen dependent. Male dogs show a 5.6-fold-increased risk compared with females; endogenous estrogens offer protection and the use of estrogenic hormones is conventional therapy for the benign lesion. Both sexes of the cocker spaniel breed show excessively high risk, suggesting that this dog family may be a model for genetic studies that could be relevant to familial aggregations of hormone-related tumors in men and women. Adrenocortical hormones may play a role in the development of the tumor in female dogs. Research into alterations of the biochemical pathways of steroidogenesis in affected female dogs may provide clues to similar conditions in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spaniel, Filip</author><author>Tintera, Jaroslav</author><author>Rydlo, Jan</author><author>Ibrahim, Ibrahim</author><author>Kasparek, Tomas</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Zaytseva, Yuliya</author><author>Matejka, Martin</author><author>Fialova, Marketa</author><author>Slovakova, Andrea</author><author>Mikolas, Pavol</author><author>Melicher, Tomas</author><author>Görnerova, Natalie</author><author>Höschl, Cyril</author><author>Hajek, Tomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Altered Neural Correlate of the Self-Agency Experience in First-Episode  Schizophrenia-Spectrum Patients: An fMRI Study.</title><secondary-title>Schizophrenia bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schizophrenia bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>916-925</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Connectome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gyrus Cinguli</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Motor Activity</keyword><keyword>Nerve Net</keyword><keyword>Perceptual Disorders</keyword><keyword>Prefrontal Cortex</keyword><keyword>Psychomotor Performance</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26685867</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/schbul/sbv188</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: The phenomenology of the clinical symptoms indicates that disturbance  of the sense of self be a core marker of schizophrenia. AIMS: To compare neural activity related to the self/other-agency judgment in patients with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (FES, n = 35) and healthy controls (HC, n = 35). METHOD: A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using motor task with temporal distortion of the visual feedback was employed. A task-related functional connectivity was analyzed with the use of independent component analysis (ICA). RESULTS: (1) During self-agency experience, FES showed a deficit in cortical activation in medial frontal gyrus (BA 10) and posterior cingulate gyrus, (BA 31; P &lt; .05, Family-Wise Error [FWE] corrected). (2) Pooled-sample task-related ICA revealed that the self/other-agency judgment was dependent upon anti-correlated default mode and central-executive networks (DMN/CEN) dynamic switching. This antagonistic mechanism was substantially impaired in FES during the task. DISCUSSION: During self-agency experience, FES demonstrate deficit in engagement of cortical midline structures along with substantial attenuation of anti-correlated DMN/CEN activity underlying normal self/other-agency discriminative processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Inai, Kiyohiko</author><author>Kitagawa, Keita</author><author>Murakami, Mami</author><author>Iwasaki, Toshiroh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lokivetmab improved pruritus in a dog with cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of veterinary medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>36-39</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies, Monoclonal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma</keyword><keyword>Pruritus</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>34866072</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1292/jvms.21-0346</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 13-year-old spayed female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with chronic  swelling and pruritus on the palmar aspect of the left forepaw and on the tail. Cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma (CEL) was diagnosed by histopathology and immunocytochemistry. Prednisolone was initially used alone as an alternative treatment for CEL. Despite long-term corticosteroid therapy, the patient's physiological (pruritus) and dermatological signs (alopecia, erythema, erosion, and ulceration with crust) progressed and showed no evidence of improvement. To address the worsening condition of pruritus, lokivetmab was started in combination with prednisolone. Once on lokivetmab, the pruritus steadily improved and was effective in resolving and maintaining remission. Further investigation on the critical role of IL-31 in the pruritus pathway of dogs with CEL is required.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sleeper, Meg M</author><author>Maczuzak, Meredith E</author><author>Bender, Susan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myocardial infarct associated with a partial thickness left atrial tear in a dog  with mitral insufficiency.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>229-236</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Atria</keyword><keyword>Heart Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Myocardial Infarction</keyword><keyword>Rupture</keyword><keyword>Thrombosis</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26263842</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2015.04.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 10-year-old male neutered cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a 1-year history  of degenerative mitral valve disease presented for dyspnea and severe weakness.

A 14-year-old female Cocker Spaniel was referred to the University of Extremadura Veterinary Clinic for clinical examination after suffering rapid deterioration, with chronic cough, anorexia and cachexia. One week after clinical examination, the dog died of right congestive heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia. Blood counts revealed lymphopenia and platelet depletion. The biochemistry profile was within normal limits, except for a drop in blood urea nitrogen. Cytological evaluation of liver and spleen biopsies revealed clustered anaplastic cells that lacked convincing tissue differentiation. Major findings at necropsy were enlarged spleen and multiple, beige to dark-red nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in diameter in the heart, lung, liver and spleen. At histological examination, multiple nests of anaplastic epithelioid cells were found in sections from all affected organs. Immunohistochemistry revealed widespread expression of CD31 and Factor VIII-related antigen. The neoplastic cells were negative for CD 18. The diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma, localized in the myocardium, lung, liver and spleen was made.

METHODS: Data on the numbers of litters born in the previous 10 years were available from a cross-sectional study of dogs belonging to breed club members (2004 Kennel Club/BSAVA Scientific Committee Purebred Dog Health Survey). In this survey 151 breeds were represented with data for households that had reported on at least 10 litters (range 10-14,15): this represented 13,141 bitches which had whelped 22,005 litters. The frequency of caesarean sections was estimated as the percentage of litters that were reported to be born by caesarean section (caesarean rates) and are reported by breed. The dogs were categorised into brachycephalic, mesocephalic and dolicocephalic breeds. RESULTS: The 10 breeds with the highest caesarean rates were the Boston terrier, bulldog, French bulldog, mastiff, Scottish terrier, miniature bull terrier, German wirehaired pointer, Clumber spaniel, Pekingese and Dandie Dinmont terrier. In the Boston terrier, bulldog and French bulldog, the rate was &gt; 80%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide evidence for the need to monitor caesarean rates in certain breeds of dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, A M</author><author>Gregory, S P</author><author>Murphy, S</author><author>McConnell, J F</author><author>Patterson-Kane, J C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the canine larynx.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>288-291</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</keyword><keyword>Disease-Free Survival</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Laryngeal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Plasmacytoma</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17425696</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00265.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused  by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skelly, B J</author><author>Sargan, D R</author><author>Herrtage, M E</author><author>Winchester, B G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The molecular defect underlying canine fucosidosis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>284-288</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Deletion</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Codon</keyword><keyword>DNA Mutational Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exons</keyword><keyword>Fucosidosis</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational</keyword><keyword>alpha-L-Fucosidase</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8730282</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/jmg.33.4.284</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Fucosidosis is a lysosomal storage disease which affects humans and English  springer spaniel dogs. The disease is recessively inherited in both species and results from a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase. We have recently cloned and sequenced the canine fucosidase gene (EMBL sequence admission number X92448 (cDNA) and X92671-X92678 (individual exonic data)). The gene spans 12 kb and consists of eight exons. SSCP based mutation analysis of affected animals was carried out on the coding region of this gene both with exonic primers, and intronic primer pairs for each exon. A 14 base pair deletion of the cDNA was identified at the 3' end of exon 1 in fucosidosis affected animals. Surprisingly, PCR based genomic cloning of DNA from these animals showed an identical deletion in this DNA, ending at the start of intron 1. This change causes a frameshift and, in consequence, 25 novel codons are transcribed in exon 2 before the first of two adjacent premature stop codons is encountered.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Arnorsdottir, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed differences in the plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone  concentration of dogs.</title><secondary-title>Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

All dogs were fed a low sodium diet for at least 3 days before blood sampling in a home setting. There was a significant difference between breeds with respect to both PRA (P = 0.0002), PAC (P = 0.002) and PRA/PAC ratio (P &lt; 0.0001). The highest PRA values were found in CKCS and Poodles, two breeds known to be predisposed to chronic valvular disease. Five CKCS had PRA values exceeding 3.0 ng/ml/h while this was the case in only one of the remaining 75 dogs. In contrast to the high PRA values, CKCS had low PAC values, and therefore much higher PRA/PAC ratios than the other breeds. In Irish wolfhounds, both the PRA and PAC values were low. In conclusion, considerable breed differences in PRA and PAC were found in the present study. Further studies are needed to determine if there is an association between developing chronic valvular disease and a high PRA in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lecoindre, A</author><author>Saade, D</author><author>Barthez, P</author><author>Cadoré, J L</author><author>Lecoindre, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital duodenocolic fistula in a dog.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>311-314</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Colonic Diseases</keyword><keyword>Diarrhea</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Duodenal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Fistula</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>28369893</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12677</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A one-year-old female cocker spaniel presented with a 6-month history of  persistent diarrhoea. Abdominal ultrasonographic examination revealed mild diffuse thickening of the intestinal wall coupled with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. A connection between the duodenum and the colon was observed during an endoscopic procedure and confirmed by computed tomography. Surgical resection of the communication allowed remission of the diarrhoea. Histology showed a normal duodenal epithelium and muscular layer. A duodenocolic fistula is an abnormal connection within the digestive tract, which in humans is usually considered a complication of a local pathological condition. Due to the absence of a predisposing cause and, in view of the dog's age and histological results, a congenital origin was suspected.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Welihozkiy, Anja</author><author>Pirie, Christopher G</author><author>Pizzirani, Stefano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scleral and suprachoroidal foreign body in a dog--a case report.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>345-351</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye</keyword><keyword>Eye Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Scleritis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21929614</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1463-5224.2011.00922.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 2-year-old male castrated Springer Spaniel with a 3-week history of waxing and  waning right sided exophthalmos, periorbital swelling, chemosis, and fundic changes was examined. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye revealed slight chemosis and nictitating membrane protrusion. Indirect ophthalmoscopy showed an approximately 8 mm peripapillary hyporeflective tapetal lesion with subretinal edema consistent with a bulbar/retrobulbar disease process. Inflammatory or neoplastic diseases were the main differential diagnoses. Ancillary diagnostics (ocular ultrasound and computed tomography) showed a focal, poorly defined dense tissue involving the caudomedial aspect of the right globe, adjacent to the optic nerve head without apparent orbital involvement. Considering the duration, location, and severity of the clinical findings, enucleation of the right globe was performed. Histopathology revealed focal thickening of the posterior wall with severe pyogranulomatous inflammation, surrounding a foreign body most consistent with plant material embedded between the sclera and the choroid (suprachoroidal). This report describes a rare case of a scleral/suprachoroidal foreign body (plant material), and outlines the difficulty of establishing an etiological diagnosis using standard ocular imaging.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacKillop, Edward</author><author>Schatzberg, Scott J</author><author>De Lahunta, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intracranial epidermoid cyst and syringohydromyelia in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>339-344</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain Stem Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Cranial Fossa, Posterior</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Cyst</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16863050</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2006.00150.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 5-year-old female Cocker Spaniel dog had a sudden onset of vestibular disease  that localized to the caudal fossa. Upon computed tomography of the brain, a large, hypoattenuating mass with a slight peripheral ring enhancement pattern was detected ventral to the cerebellum. A hypoattenuating region was also identified in the center of the C2 spinal cord segment, consistent with syringohydromyelia. Postmortem examination of the brain revealed a fluid filled, cystic mass located dorsal to medulla oblongata that caused severe compression of the overlying cerebellum. The histopathologic diagnosis was an epidermoid cyst. Extensive syringohydromyelia and obstructive hydrocephalus were identified, both thought to be secondary to overcrowding of the caudal fossa.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clements, D N</author><author>McGill, S</author><author>Beths, T</author><author>Sullivan, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tracheal perforation secondary to suture irritation in a dog following a ventral  slot procedure.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>313-315</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cervical Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Emphysema</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</keyword><keyword>Surgical Flaps</keyword><keyword>Sutures</keyword><keyword>Trachea</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12866929</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00160.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An eight-year-old springer spaniel was presented with acute-onset subcutaneous  emphysema of five days' duration. The dog had undergone ventral slot decompression of the C5-C6 intervertebral disc space eight weeks before presentation. Cervical tracheoscopy demonstrated perforation of the dorsal tracheal membrane of the distal cervical trachea. Perforation of the dorsal tracheal membrane secondary to suture knot irritation was confirmed by exploratory surgery. Repair of the perforation was performed by plication of the dorsal tracheal membrane. The dog was re-presented nine days after the initial surgery with acute recurrence of subcutaneous emphysema. Air leakage at the plicated dorsal tracheal membrane was observed at exploratory surgery, and a bipedicle sternothyroideus muscle flap was used to support the plicated membrane. Recovery was uneventful and 10 months postoperatively there had been no recurrence of clinical signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paik, Jooyae</author><author>Kang, Ji-Houn</author><author>Chang, Dongwoo</author><author>Yang, Mhan-Pyo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema in a Dog Following Initiation of Therapy for  Concurrent Hypoadrenocorticism and Hypothyroidism.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>378-384</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adrenal Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fludrocortisone</keyword><keyword>Glucocorticoids</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Hypothyroidism</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema</keyword><keyword>Thyroxine</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27685367</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6225</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 5 yr old intact female cocker spaniel dog weighing 7.8 kg was referred with  anorexia, vomiting, and depression. At referral, the dog was diagnosed initially with typical hypoadrenocorticism, and 2 d later, concurrent primary hypothyroidism was detected. Hormonal replacement therapies, including fludrocortisone, prednisolone, and levothyroxine, were initiated, but a few days later the dog became abruptly tachypneic, and thoracic radiographs indicated the development of pulmonary edema. Echocardiography showed that there were abnormalities indicating impaired left ventricular function, although the heart valves were normal. Following treatment with pimobendan and furosemide, the pulmonary edema resolved. The dog had no recurrence of the clinical signs after 10 mo of follow-up, despite being off all cardiac medications; consequently, the cardiac failure was transient or reversible in this dog. The case report describes the stepwise diagnosis and successful treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary edema after initiation of hormonal replacement therapy for concurrent hypoadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walton, M B</author><author>Mardell, E</author><author>Spoor, M</author><author>Innes, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lameness associated with tarsal haemarthrosis as the sole clinical sign of  idiopathic immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>491-495</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hemarthrosis</keyword><keyword>Lameness, Animal</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Purpura, Thrombocytopenic,  Idiopathic</keyword><keyword>Synovial Fluid</keyword><keyword>Tarsus, Animal</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25327981</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3415/VCOT-14-03-0041</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A four-year-old, male Cocker Spaniel was presented for investigation of pelvic  limb stiffness.

There were bilateral generalized increased lung sounds, bilateral episcleral hemorrhage, and systemic hypertension. Prolonged buccal mucosal bleeding time and elevated D-dimer concentrations were detected. Radiographically, there was a generalized moderate unstructured interstitial pattern. In thoracic CT images, there was a diffuse moderate hyperattenuating appearance of the bronchial walls and interstitium and diffuse areas of moderate bronchiectasis. The brain CT images were characterized by marked hyperattenuating well-defined masses. In addition, there were smaller hyperattenuating and hypoattenuating masses scattered throughout the cerebral and cerebellar parenchyma. A zinc sulphate flotation test confirmed large numbers of Angiostrongylus vasorum L1 larvae. Despite therapy the dog continued to deteriorate and underwent euthanasia.

These genes are candidates for hereditary nephritis (Alport syndrome) in several dog breeds (e.g. English Cocker Spaniel and Bull Terrier). Using RACE and PCR, the cDNA of both genes was cloned and sequenced. Both COL4A3 and COL4A4, as well as canine NPPC (Natriuretic Peptide Precursor C), were mapped to CFA25 using an RH panel. Conservation of the tight linkage of COL4A3 and COL4A4 as seen in human and mouse was verified in the dog. Intron-exon boundaries in both genes were determined by BLAST analysis of the Canis Familiaris Trace Archive. The elucidation of the cDNA sequences, genomic organization and the open reading frames of canine COL4A3 and COL4A4 provide the groundwork for screening these genes for mutations in hereditary nephritis in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Juneja, R K</author><author>Arnold, I C</author><author>Gahne, B</author><author>Bouw, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parentage testing of dogs using variants of blood proteins: description of five  new plasma protein polymorphisms.</title><secondary-title>Animal genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>297-310</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Alpha-Globulins</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Protein Electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Transferrin</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>2450490</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2052.1987.tb00773.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Plasma samples of 1126 dogs belonging to 21 different European breeds were  analysed by two-dimensional agarose gel (pH 5.4 or pH 8.6)--horizontal polyacrylamide gel (pH 9.0) electrophoresis, followed by general-protein staining of gels.

Three alleles are reported in the Prt1 and Prt2 systems and two alleles in the Prt2, Pa1 and Pa3 systems. While Prt2 variation was observed only in the cocker spaniel breed, each of the other four proteins showed a high degree of polymorphism in most of the breeds studied. Pa3 fractions were clearly observed only in samples stored at -20 degrees C for more than 2 years. Prt1, Pa1 and Pa2 proteins are additional useful markers for parentage control in dogs.

SM is a complex trait with a moderately high heritability. Selective breeding against SM is confounded by its complex inheritance, its late onset nature and high prevalence in some breeds. This study investigated the early outcome of existing SM breeding guidelines. Six hundred and forty-three dogs, 550 Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) and 93 Griffon Bruxellois (GB), were identified as having either one (454 dogs) or both parents (189 dogs) with MRI-determined SM status. Offspring without SM were more common when the parents were both clear of SM (SM-free; CKCS 70 per cent, GB 73 per cent). Conversely, offspring with SM were more likely when both parents had SM (SM-affected; CKCS 92 per cent, GB 100 per cent). A mating of one SM-free parent with an SM-affected parent was risky for SM affectedness with 77 per cent of CKCS and 46 per cent of GB offspring being SM-affected. It is recommended that all breeding dogs from breeds susceptible to SM be MRI screened; that the SM status at five years old is established; and all results submitted to a central database that can be used by dog breeders to better enable mate selection based on estimated breeding values.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rivera, Patricio</author><author>Melin, Malin</author><author>Biagi, Tara</author><author>Fall, Tove</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author><author>Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin</author><author>von Euler, Henrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mammary tumor development in dogs is associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>8770-8774</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes, BRCA1</keyword><keyword>Genes, BRCA2</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19887619</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1725</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Breast cancer is a major contributor to overall morbidity and mortality in women.  Several genes predisposing to breast cancer have been identified, but the majority of risk factors remain unknown. Even less is known about the inherited risk factors underlying canine mammary tumors (CMT). Clear breed predispositions exist, with 36% of English springer spaniels (ESS) in Sweden being affected. Here, we evaluate 10 human breast cancer genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ERBB2, FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, RCAS1, TOX3, and TP53) for association with CMTs. Sixty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; four to nine SNPs per gene) were genotyped by iPLEX in female ESS dogs, 212 CMT cases and 143 controls. Two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were significantly associated with CMT (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.005 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Borderline association was seen for FGFR2. Benign and malignant cases were also analyzed separately. Those findings supported the association to BRCA1 and BRCA2 but with a stronger association to BRCA1 in malignant cases. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 showed odds ratios of approximately 4. In conclusion, this study indicates that BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute to the risk of CMT in ESS, suggesting that dogs may serve as a good model for human breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCaw, D</author><author>Aronson, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital cardiac disease in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Modern veterinary practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Modern veterinary practice</full-title></periodical><pages>451-457</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiocardiography</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6738521</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is thought to be inherited and occurs twice as  often in females as in males, most commonly in Poodles, Collies, Cocker Spaniels and Shetland Sheepdogs. About half of untreated dogs develop left-sided heart failure by 8 months of age. Clinical signs include coughing, decreased exercise tolerance, pulmonary edema, a &quot;machinery&quot; murmur in the pulmonic-aortic region, and a bounding pulse. An ECG may reveal an increased amplitude of the R wave and a lengthened P wave. Plain LAT films reveal loss of the cranial and caudal cardiac waists, increased sternal contact of the heart, increased width and straightened caudal border of the cardiac silhouette, elevated carina, and an enlarged left atrium. Changes on plain DV films include an elongated cardiac silhouette, enlarged right ventricle, and 3 bulges on the left side of the cardiac silhouette. Nonselective angiocardiography can be used for a definitive diagnosis and to demonstrate a reverse right-to-left PDA, in which the ascending aorta, brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery are not opacified by contrast medium. Animals with a right-to-left shunt PDA are cyanotic in caudal body parts. Treatment of left-to-right shunt PDA involves ligation with 2 nonabsorbable sutures. A right-to-left shunt PDA should not be ligated but is treated by restricted exercise and periodic phlebotomy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bond, R</author><author>Varjonen, K</author><author>Hendricks, A</author><author>Chang, Y M</author><author>Brooks Brownlie, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and pathological features of hair coat abnormalities in curly coated  retrievers from UK and Sweden.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>659-667</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Alopecia</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hair Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>Surveys and Questionnaires</keyword><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27925662</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jsap.12605</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To gain information on hair loss amongst curly coated retrievers by  questionnaire and to define the clinical and pathological features of hair coat abnormalities in affected dogs in the United Kingdom and Sweden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by members of the Curly Coated Retriever Clubs. Fourteen dogs (six in the United Kingdom, eight in Sweden) were clinically examined and skin/hair samples collected for microscopy and histopathology. Blood was collected for haematological, biochemical and endocrine assays. RESULTS: Of 90 dogs surveyed, 39 had current or previous episodes of symmetrical, non-pruritic alopecia and or frizzy coat changes, usually affecting caudal thighs, axillae, dorsum and neck before 18 months of age; 23 dogs had a waxing/waning course. Examined dogs generally matched the pattern described in questionnaires. Hair shaft anomalies comprised occasional distorted anagen bulbs (10 dogs) and transverse fractures (8 dogs). Vertical histopathological sections showed infundibular hyperkeratosis (28 of 30 sections) and low-grade pigment clumping (17 of 30). Subtle telogenisation of hair follicles was unequivocally confirmed by transverse histomorphometric analyses. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The follicular dysplasia of curly coated retriever reported here is similar to that of Irish water spaniels and Chesapeake Bay retrievers but distinct from that of Portuguese water dogs. The genetic basis requires further assessment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yasue, S</author><author>Handa, S</author><author>Miyagawa, S</author><author>Inoue, J</author><author>Hasegawa, A</author><author>Yamakawa, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Difference in form of sialic acid in red blood cell glycolipids of different  breeds of dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1101-1107</pages><volume>83</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Group Antigens</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Erythrocyte Membrane</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>G(M3) Ganglioside</keyword><keyword>Gangliosides</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuraminic Acids</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Sialic Acids</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1978</year></dates><accession-num>659384</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a131999</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hematoside from dog erythrocyte membrane was previously considered to contain a  mixture of N-acetyl- and N-glycolyl- neuraminic acids. However, the hematoside preparation used in the previous study was obtained from pooled blood of several dogs, and individual variation in hematoside was not examined. In this work, hematosides of erythrocytes from 31 mongrel dogs and 108 dogs of 23 breeds were examined individually by thin-layer chromatography, and the component sialic acids were analysed by gas-liquid chromatography. Individual dogs had either NAN-hematoside or NGN-hematoside: dogs with N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid also had a trace of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, but dogs with N-acetyl-neuraminic acid had no detectable N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid. A few mongrel dogs, some Kai dogs, Kishu dogs, Japanese spaniels and most Shiba dogs had NGN-hematoside, whereas all European dogs had NAN-hematoside and no NGN-hematoside. From pedigrees of some families, inheritance of NGN-hematoside was found to be autosomal dominant. NGN-hematoside is possibly one of dog blood group substances. The sialic acid of delipidized ghost protein of dogs with NGN-hematoside was N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid, and that of dogs with NAN-hematoside was N-acetyl-neuraminic acid. The sialic acid of plasma protein was mainly N-acetyl-neuraminic acid in all dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishida, Miki</author><author>Kagawa, Yumiko</author><author>Mizukoshi, Takahiro</author><author>Mizuno, Masashi</author><author>Mizuno, Takeshi</author><author>Harada, Kayoko</author><author>Uechi, Masami</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Post-mortem evaluation of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) used in mitral  valve repair in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>307-312</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Valve Prosthesis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Polytetrafluoroethylene</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22361171</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2011.11.004</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Mitral valve repair is one of the treatment options for mitral regurgitation.  Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a polymer that has been widely used in cardiovascular surgery. In this case series, we report the autopsy and histological findings in 6 dogs that underwent cardiopulmonary bypass for mitral annuloplasty using ePTFE sheets and chordoplasty using ePTFE sutures. From May 2005 to October 2009, 3 female and 3 male dogs with severe mitral regurgitation underwent mitral valve repair. This case series included 3 Cavalier King Charles spaniels, 2 Maltese, and 1 Shih Tzu. The survival period after surgery was 19-72 (35 ± 19) months. In all the cases, autopsy revealed that the ePTFE sheets and sutures were not damaged and well integrated into the surrounding highly differentiated, connective tissues. Low-power microscopy revealed that in all cases, the tissues surrounding the ePTFE sheet in the mitral valve annulus had almost completely been covered by granulation tissue. No inflammatory infiltrate or thrombogenesis was observed around the ePTFE in any of the cases. There was no evidence of reactive changes in the region surrounding the ePTFE. These results suggest that ePTFE has excellent tissue compatibility and durability and can be effectively used for canine mitral valve repair.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Switonski, M</author><author>Payan-Carreira, R</author><author>Bartz, M</author><author>Nowacka-Woszuk, J</author><author>Szczerbal, I</author><author>Colaço, B</author><author>Pires, M A</author><author>Ochota, M</author><author>Nizanski, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hypospadias in a male (78,XY; SRY-positive) dog and sex reversal female (78,XX;  SRY-negative) dogs: clinical, histological and genetic studies.</title><secondary-title>Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology,  embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology,  embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation</full-title></periodical><pages>128-134</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cryptorchidism</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hypospadias</keyword><keyword>Karyotype</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Ovotesticular Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>Y Chromosome</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21893969</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000330921</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hypospadias is rarely reported in dogs. In this study we pre-sent 2 novel cases  of this disorder of sexual development and, in addition, a case of hereditary sex reversal in a female with an enlarged clitoris. The first case was a male Moscow watchdog with a normal karyotype (78,XY) and the presence of the SRY gene. In this dog, perineal hypospadias, bilateral inguinal cryptorchidism and testes were observed. The second case, representing the Cocker spaniel breed, had a small penis with a hypospadic orifice of the urethra, bilateral cryptorchidism, testis and a rudimentary gonad inside an ovarian bursa, a normal female karyotype (78,XX) and a lack of the SRY gene. This animal was classified as a compound sex reversal (78,XX, SRY-negative) with the hypospadias syndrome. The third case was a Cocker spaniel female with an enlarged clitoris and internally located ovotestes. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a normal female karyotype (78,XX) and a lack of the SRY gene, while histology of the gonads showed an ovotesticular structure. This case was classified as a typical hereditary sex reversal syndrome (78,XX, SRY-negative). Molecular studies were focused on coding sequences of the SRY gene (case 1) and 2 candidates for monogenic hypospadias, namely MAMLD1 (mastermind-like domain containing 1) and SRD5A2 (steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2). Sequencing of the entire SRY gene, including 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, did not reveal any mutation. The entire coding sequence of MAMLD1 and SRD5A2 was analyzed in all the intersexes, as well as in 4 phenotypically normal control dogs (3 females and 1 male). In MAMLD1 2 SNPs, including 1 missense substitution in exon 1 (c.128A&gt;G, Asp43Ser), were identified, whereas in SRD5A2 7 polymorphisms, including 1 missense SNP (c.358G&gt;A, Ala120Thr), were found. None of the identified polymorphisms cosegregated with the intersexual phenotype, thus, we cannot confirm that hypospadias may be associated with polymorphism in the coding sequence of the studied genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anýž, Jiří</author><author>Bakštein, Eduard</author><author>Dudysová, Daniela</author><author>Veldová, Karolína</author><author>Kliková, Monika</author><author>Fárková, Eva</author><author>Kopřivová, Jana</author><author>Španiel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No wink of sleep: Population sleep characteristics in response to the brexit poll  and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</title><secondary-title>Social science &amp; medicine (1982)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Social science &amp; medicine (1982)</full-title></periodical><pages>112-121</pages><volume>222</volume><keywords><keyword>Accelerometry</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mobile Applications</keyword><keyword>Politics</keyword><keyword>Sleep</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30623796</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.12.024</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Personal well-being, including people's sleep characteristics, is affected by a  variety of factors, one example of which is wide-ranging high-impact public events. In this study, we use a large sleep database obtained through a smartphone application for sleep tracking via anonymized time-sampled data to study the effect of two political events with a wide-ranging impact on people's sleep characteristics: the Brexit referendum in June 2016, and the presidential election of Donald Trump in November 2016 METHOD: Using Sleep as Android - an actigraphy-based sleep monitoring smartphone application - we collected 10.5 million geo-located sleep records from more than 69,000 users in Europe and North America. Population-based changes in sleep around each of these two events, in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America, were assessed using a non-parametric bootstrap test RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant reduction by 16 min and 21 s in the mean sleep duration of British people in the night after the Brexit poll (p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the analysis of the US presidential election revealed a significant 12 min 49 s drop in the mean sleep duration during the night following the event, in comparison with the whole studied region (p &lt; 0.001), and an increase by 5 min and 9 s in the subsequent night (p = 0.0328). Additional analysis comparing the election night to comparable days in preceding years revealed that the actual reduction in sleep length may have been even greater. There is also an increase in the proportion of subjects with very short sleep CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a significant impact of two specific major political events on population sleep characteristics. Our results further underline the potential of mobile applications and informatics approaches in general to provide data that enable us to investigate fundamental physiological variables over time and location.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plessas, I N</author><author>Volk, H A</author><author>Rusbridge, C</author><author>Vanhaesebrouck, A E</author><author>Jeffery, N D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of gabapentin versus topiramate on clinically affected dogs with  Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>288</pages><volume>177</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Amines</keyword><keyword>Analgesics</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Cross-Over Studies</keyword><keyword>Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fructose</keyword><keyword>Gabapentin</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neuralgia</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Quality of Life</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>Topiramate</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>gamma-Aminobutyric Acid</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26269418</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/vr.103234</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>To date there is no evidence-based data for efficacious treatment of neuropathic  pain in dogs with Chiari-like malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM). The objective of this prospective cross-over study was to compare the effect of gabapentin versus topiramate, as an add-on treatment to carprofen, on quality of life (QoL) of dogs experiencing signs of neuropathic pain due to CM/SM. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the QoL: (1) on day 0; (2) after 1 week of carprofen only; (3) after 2 weeks on carprofen and gabapentin; and (4) after 2 weeks on carprofen and topiramate. No significant difference was observed between VAS after gabapentin or topiramate (P=0.91). However, an improvement in QoL was observed when gabapentin was compared with baseline (P=0.009), but not for topiramate. In conclusion, the addition of gabapentin was more effective in improving QoL than carprofen alone, but the study failed to identify that gabapentin was more efficacious than topiramate. Perhaps the more favourable side effect profile of the former makes it more suitable for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with CM/SM but further placebo-controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy of these drugs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Go, D-M</author><author>Lee, S-H</author><author>Woo, S-H</author><author>Kim, D-Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intra-oral Sebaceous Gland Tumours in Two Dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>296-298</pages><volume>157</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Mouth Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Sebaceous Gland Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29169626</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.10.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 12-year-old female miniature schnauzer and a 12-year-old neutered female cocker  spaniel each had a grey-yellow nodular lesion arising from the gingiva.

MRI findings are available for only one of those cases. Herein the authors present an 11 yr old English springer spaniel diagnosed with pituitary metastasis of pancreatic origin with a 24 hr history of blindness and only a single lesion on MRI. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations localized the lesion to the optic nerves, optic tracts, or optic chiasm. MRI showed a single lesion characterized by a well-circumscribed pituitary mass with extrasellar extension, causing compression of the optic chiasm. Signal intensity was unusual as enhancement could not be appreciated after contrast administration. The dog was euthanized without further diagnostic tests. Histopathologic examination revealed a poorly differentiated exocrine pancreatic carcinoma with widespread metastasis involving the pituitary gland. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such case reported in a dog. Pituitary metastases should be included as a differential diagnosis for dogs presenting with acute-onset blindness and for single brain masses affecting the pituitary gland.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dandrieux, Julien R S</author><author>Timm, Katrin</author><author>Roosje, Petra J</author><author>Welle, Monika</author><author>Howard, Judith</author><author>Brühschwein, Andreas</author><author>Francey, Thierry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unusual systemic signs in a dog with sterile neutrophilic-macrophagic  lymphadenitis and nodular panniculitis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>117-121</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Inflammatory Agents</keyword><keyword>Blood Cell Count</keyword><keyword>Cyclosporine</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>Panniculitis, Nodular Nonsuppurative</keyword><keyword>Prednisolone</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21311075</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-5563</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7 mo old female English springer spaniel was presented with diarrhea, vomiting,  apathy, and hyperthermia.

The dog responded to prednisolone, but relapsed during medication tapering. Cyclosporine had to be added to control the disease. No further relapse had occurred 98 wk after the first presentation. This is an unusual presentation of a systemic sterile neutrophilic-macrophagic lymphadenitis with nodular panniculitis and vasculitis associated with gastrointestinal and pulmonary signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rizzi, Theresa E</author><author>Cowell, Rick L</author><author>Meinkoth, James H</author><author>Gilmour, Margi A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>More than meets the eye: subretinal aspirate from an acutely blind dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>111-113</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blindness</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Eye</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Infections</keyword><keyword>Prototheca</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16511801</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-165x.2006.tb00099.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 14-year-old, spayed female Cocker Spaniel was presented to the Boren Veterinary  Medical Teaching Hospital at Oklahoma State University with acute loss of vision in the right eye and a history of intermittent bloody diarrhea of unknown duration. Small, white, plaque-like lesions in the retina and subretina were visualized by direct ophthalmic examination, and aspirated with ultrasound-guidance. A direct smear of the subretinal fluid was highly cellular and contained large numbers of pleomorphic organisms consistent with Prototheca sp. The structures were round, oval, or elongated, 4-6 microm width and 8-16 microm in length and surrounded by a thin, clear cell wall. Small, central, pink to purple nuclei were observed in some organisms, but in most, the nuclei were obscured by a deeply basophilic, granular cytoplasm. Some organisms contained endospores. Negatively-stained structures of similar size and shape were considered to be empty casings (theca) of ruptured sporulating and nonsporulating forms of the organism. Protothecosis usually is a disseminated, fatal disease in dogs. The Prototheca organisms observed in this case showed characteristic morphology, illustrating the ability to diagnose protothecosis in cytologic samples.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fischer, J R</author><author>Smith, S A</author><author>Harkin, K R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glucagon constant-rate infusion: a novel strategy for the management of  hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic crisis in the dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>27-32</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gastrointestinal Agents</keyword><keyword>Glucagon</keyword><keyword>Hyperinsulinism</keyword><keyword>Hypoglycemia</keyword><keyword>Infusions, Intravenous</keyword><keyword>Insulinoma</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Seizures</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10667403</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/15473317-36-1-27</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A six-year-old, spayed female, cocker spaniel was presented for hypoglycemic  seizures. Hypoglycemia with concomitant hyperinsulinemia suggested an insulin-secreting tumor. Pancreatic masses were resected, and insulinoma was diagnosed. Six weeks later, the dog presented in hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic crisis (HHC). The dog was initially stabilized with intravenous dextrose boluses and infusions, but seizure activity recurred and persisted. A glucagon constant-rate infusion (GCRI) was initiated, and neurological signs quickly resolved. Dextrose was withdrawn over 24 hours, and euglycemia was maintained by GCRI alone. Despite aggressive medical management including the use of prednisone, diazoxide, bovine somatotropin, and streptozocin, the dog presented on two subsequent occasions in HHC and both times was rapidly stabilized with GCRI alone. In this dog, GCRI was a fast, safe, and effective method of achieving and maintaining euglycemia despite intractable hyperinsulinism. The clinical use of GCRI merits further investigation for management of HHC in veterinary species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ogawa, Mizuki</author><author>Miyakawa, Hirosumi</author><author>Hsu, Huai-Hsun</author><author>Miyagawa, Yuichi</author><author>Takemura, Naoyuki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A dog presenting with syncope due to two different etiologies.</title><secondary-title>Journal of advanced veterinary and animal research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of advanced veterinary and animal research</full-title></periodical><pages>440-446</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36382040</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5455/javar.2022.i612</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The treatment of syncope depends largely on its possible etiology.  Therefore, identifying the cause of syncope is very important in treatment planning. Herein, we report an etiology of syncope caused by pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with canine filariasis, followed by syncope due to bradyarrhythmia 1 year later. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 8-year-old male English Cocker Spaniel was referred to our hospital for a second opinion regarding syncope that the dog had started experiencing approximately 2 months prior. Based on the examination findings, we diagnosed that the fainting was due to heartworm disease and associated PH. After increasing the dose of pimobendan (0.50 mg/kg, q12h), the syncope subsided. However, syncope recurred on the 215th day of the first episode. RESULTS: The findings that differed from those during the initial examination were that cardiac arrest was observed for approximately 5 sec during auscultation, along with sinus arrest. Therefore, to further investigate for syncope, a Holter electrocardiograph was obtained for 3 days. Consequently, sinus arrest was identified as the etiology of the recurrent syncope, and the patient was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome, Rubenstein classification type II. Following cilostazol (10 mg/kg, q12h) administration, the syncope subsided. CONCLUSION: This case reports syncope in a dog, which typically occurs due to different etiologies. When a dog has PH, it may be important to think about the possibility of arrhythmias caused by a bigger right heart.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gardner, L</author><author>Silva, J</author><author>Novo Matos, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spontaneous closure of a traumatic acquired Gerbode defect in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>194-198</pages><volume>41</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrioventricular Block</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35413633</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2022.03.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A one-year-old female English Springer Spaniel with no previous history of  cardiac disease presented to the Queen's Veterinary School Hospital following a blunt traumatic incident with an acquired, direct Gerbode defect and associated third-degree atrioventricular block. Two months after the initial incident, follow-up echocardiography showed a nearly closed Gerbode defect with just trivial residual flow. A 24-h Holter monitor indicated second-degree atrioventricular block with occasional junctional tachycardia. A reassessment 22 months later confirmed spontaneous closure of the previously acquired traumatic Gerbode defect, with 2:1 second-degree atrioventricular block. The dog remained clinically asymptomatic, and free of treatment.

The dog responded well to the initial chemotherapy with nimustine for 3 months. Since recurrence of skin erosion and bladder wall thickening were observed, the dog was subsequently administered chemotherapy with other anticancer drugs, including chlorambucil, vincristine, doxorubicin, L-asparaginase, cytosine arabinoside, and cyclophosphamide.

However, this therapy was ineffective. At necropsy, neoplastic tissues were seen extending into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, liver, pancreas and kidneys as gross findings. A large mass was also identified occupying the caudal thorax. Histologic findings included infiltration in these organs and the mass by neoplastic lymphocytes.

OBJECTIVE: Describe a clinical syndrome in dogs similar to pituitary apoplexy in humans. ANIMALS: Four dogs exhibiting a sudden onset of neurologic signs. METHODS: A retrospective study was used, including clinical examination, computed tomography (CT), postmortem examination, and histopathology of the brain. Pituitary tissue from 3 of the dogs was subjected to immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Four dogs (2 Mongrels, 1 Bordeaux Dog, and 1 Cocker Spaniel; median age, 11 years; median body weight, 20.5 kg) presented with acute neurologic signs including depression (n = 3), behavioral changes (n = 1), vision loss (n = 1), seizures (n = 1), and collapse (n = 1). CT disclosed suprasellar infarction, hemorrhage, or both associated with a pituitary macroadenoma in 3 dogs and a frank hemorrhage in a nonadenomatous pituitary gland in 1 dog. CT findings were correlated with postmortem findings, and pituitary apoplexy was confirmed by histopathology and immunocytochemistry of the pituitary tissue. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study provides histopathologic evidence of pituitary apoplexy in dogs. The results are relevant for future diagnosis and treatment of pituitary disease in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kothapalli, K S D</author><author>Kirkness, E F</author><author>Vanwormer, R</author><author>Meyers-Wallen, V N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exclusion of DMRT1 as a candidate gene for canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>559-561</pages><volume>171</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genes, Homeobox</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Sex Determination Analysis</keyword><keyword>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</keyword><keyword>Testis</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16624726</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2004.12.013</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>DMRT1, which encodes a zinc finger-like DNA binding motif, is a well-conserved  gene that is involved in testis differentiation in a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. The objective of this study was to determine whether a DMRT1 microsatellite marker allele is associated with the affected phenotype in a pedigree of canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal generated from an American Cocker spaniel founder. Ten affected dogs and their parents and grandparents were genotyped. Four alleles at this locus and five different genotypes were found in this pedigree. All affected dogs inherited this trait from the foundation sire of this colony. Thus, the disease-causing mutation should be identical by descent in all affected dogs. Six affected dogs were found to have genotypes at this locus that were different from those of the founder sire. These results indicate that DMRT1 is an unlikely candidate gene for SRY-negative XX sex reversal in this model.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melniczek, J R</author><author>Dambach, D</author><author>Prociuk, U</author><author>Jezyk, P F</author><author>Henthorn, P S</author><author>Patterson, D F</author><author>Giger, U</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sry-negative XX sex reversal in a family of Norwegian Elkhounds.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>564-569</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>Genitalia, Male</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Sex Chromosome Aberrations</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10587257</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(1999)013&lt;0564:snxsri&gt;2.3.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Two related female Norwegian Elkhounds were evaluated at 6 and 8 months of age  for enlarged clitori.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 1,644 dogs. PROCEDURES: Medical records of dogs evaluated for behavioral problems were reviewed for breed, sex, reproductive status, consultation year, birth date, and diagnoses. RESULTS: Numbers of dogs with aggression, anxiety, and unruly behavior increased over the course of the study, as did the total number of dogs evaluated for behavioral problems. In general and for aggression, Dalmatians, English Springer Spaniels, German Shepherd Dogs, and mixed-breed dogs were evaluated more often than expected, whereas Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers were evaluated less often than expected. Labrador Retrievers were also underrepresented for anxiety, whereas mixed-breed dogs were overrepresented. Males were overrepresented except for interdog aggression, anxieties, and phobias, whereas females were overrepresented for phobias. Dogs with phobias were evaluated at a median age of 6.5 years, compared with dogs with other problems (median age, 2.5 years). A mean of 1.6 diagnoses/dog was observed, with certain diagnoses clustered. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that in dogs, behavioral problems changed over the course of the study; age, sex, and breed distributions varied among diagnoses; and certain diagnoses were likely to occur together.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Outerbridge, Catherine A</author><author>Marks, Stanley L</author><author>Rogers, Quinton R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasma amino acid concentrations in 36 dogs with histologically confirmed  superficial necrolytic dermatitis.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>177-186</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acids</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Syndrome</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12174180</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-3164.2002.00295.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured in 36 dogs diagnosed with  superficial necrolytic dermatitis (SND) via skin biopsy.

The ratio of branched chain amino acids to aromatic amino acids in the dogs with SND was 2.6, slightly lower than that in normal dogs. The mean plasma amino acid concentrations for dogs with SND were significantly lower than for dogs with acute and chronic hepatitis. A metabolic hepatopathy in which there is increased hepatic catabolism of amino acids is hypothesized to explain the hypoaminoacidaemia seen in SND.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cork, L C</author><author>Price, D L</author><author>Griffin, J W</author><author>Sack, G H Jr</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy: canine motor neuron disease.</title><secondary-title>Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche  veterinaire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche  veterinaire</full-title></periodical><pages>77-82</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Motor Neurons</keyword><keyword>Muscular Atrophy, Spinal</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year></dates><accession-num>2306675</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Motor neuron diseases, manifest as weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles,  occur in infancy, childhood, and adult life. Some forms of this disease are inherited. Motor neurons are selectively affected and exhibit cytoskeletal pathology, primarily enlargements of proximal axons by accumulations of transported neurofilaments. A motor neuron disease, hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy, has been discovered in Brittany spaniels. The disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant characteristic and shows striking clinical and pathological features in common with human motor neuron disease. The availability of this excellent animal model of the human condition has allowed neurobiological investigations of the dynamics of structural and chemical pathologies of vulnerable neurons.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danesi, Patrizia</author><author>Petini, Matteo</author><author>Falcaro, Christian</author><author>Bertola, Michela</author><author>Mazzotta, Elisa</author><author>Furlanello, Tommaso</author><author>Krockenberger, Mark</author><author>Malik, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pneumocystis Colonization in Dogs Is as in Humans.</title><secondary-title>International journal of environmental research and public health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of environmental research and public health</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Mammals</keyword><keyword>Plant Breeding</keyword><keyword>Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia, Pneumocystis</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35328882</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijerph19063192</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Pneumocystis is an atypical fungus that resides in the pulmonary parenchyma of  many mammals, including humans and dogs. Immunocompetent human hosts are usually asymptomatically colonised or show subtle clinical signs, but some immunocompromised people can develop florid life-threatening Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Since much less is known concerning Pneumocystis in dogs, we posit the question: can Pneumocystis colonization be present in dogs with inflammatory airway or lung disease caused by other pathogens or disease processes? In this study, Pneumocystis DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 22/255 dogs (9%) with respiratory distress and/or chronic cough. Although young dogs (&lt;1 year-of-age) and pedigree breeds were more often Pneumocystis-qPCR positive than older dogs and crossbreds, adult dogs with other infectious conditions and/or a history of therapy-resistant pulmonary disease could also be qPCR-positive, including two patients with suppression of the immune system. Absence of pathognomonic clinical or radiographic signs render it impossible to convincingly discriminate between overt PCP versus other lung/airway disease processes colonised by P. canis. It is possible that colonisation with P. canis might play a certain role as a co-pathogen in some canine patients with lower respiratory disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ekenstedt, Kari J</author><author>Patterson, Edward E</author><author>Minor, Katie M</author><author>Mickelson, James R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Candidate genes for idiopathic epilepsy in four dog breeds.</title><secondary-title>BMC genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>38</pages><volume>12</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epilepsy</keyword><keyword>Genetic Linkage</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Microsatellite Repeats</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21518446</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2156-12-38</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic epilepsy (IE) is a naturally occurring and significant  seizure disorder affecting all dog breeds. Because dog breeds are genetically isolated populations, it is possible that IE is attributable to common founders and is genetically homogenous within breeds. In humans, a number of mutations, the majority of which are genes encoding ion channels, neurotransmitters, or their regulatory subunits, have been discovered to cause rare, specific types of IE. It was hypothesized that there are simple genetic bases for IE in some purebred dog breeds, specifically in Vizslas, English Springer Spaniels (ESS), Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs (GSMD), and Beagles, and that the gene(s) responsible may, in some cases, be the same as those already discovered in humans. RESULTS: Candidate genes known to be involved in human epilepsy, along with selected additional genes in the same gene families that are involved in murine epilepsy or are expressed in neural tissue, were examined in populations of affected and unaffected dogs. Microsatellite markers in close proximity to each candidate gene were genotyped and subjected to two-point linkage in Vizslas, and association analysis in ESS, GSMD and Beagles. CONCLUSIONS: Most of these candidate genes were not significantly associated with IE in these four dog breeds, while a few genes remained inconclusive. Other genes not included in this study may still be causing monogenic IE in these breeds or, like many cases of human IE, the disease in dogs may be likewise polygenic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sevelius, E</author><author>Andersson, M</author><author>Jönsson, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatic accumulation of alpha-1-antitrypsin in chronic liver disease in the dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>401-412</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Immunoelectrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Liver Diseases</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>alpha 1-Antitrypsin</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7884057</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0021-9975(05)80098-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency has long been known to cause liver cirrhosis in  man, but whether it does so in the dog is uncertain. To investigate this point 57 dogs with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed chronic liver disease were examined. Isoelectric focusing of blood serum from these dogs and from 25 clinically healthy dogs revealed three different types of alpha-1 antitrypsin, designated F(fast), I(intermediate) and S(slow). They appeared in both homozygous and heterozygous forms, the F type being seen most frequently. The I type was more common in cocker spaniels than in other breeds. Immunostaining for alpha-1 antitrypsin revealed that 37 diseased dogs had alpha-1 antitrypsin in the cytoplasm of their hepatocytes. Of these, 21 dogs had globular alpha-1 antitrypsin inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating aggregated protein. Accumulated alpha-1 antitrypsin was found most frequently in dogs having the I and S types of alpha-1 antitrypsin, either homozygously or heterozygously. With a few exceptions, F-homozygotic dogs had no hepatocellular alpha-1 antitrypsin accumulation. As alpha-1 antitrypsin aggregation is lethal to hepatocytes and as cell death attracts mononuclear blood cells whose cytokines induce continued alpha-1 antitrypsin synthesis with subsequent risk of further alpha-1 antitrypsin accumulation, liver disease may thus be maintained. Whether alpha-1 antitrypsin aggregates actually initiate liver disease in dogs, as in man, remains to be elucidated by further biochemical investigation of the three canine alpha-1 antitrypsin types found.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aguirre, G D</author><author>Acland, G M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variation in retinal degeneration phenotype inherited at the prcd locus.</title><secondary-title>Experimental eye research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental eye research</full-title></periodical><pages>663-687</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Crosses, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electroretinography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Retina</keyword><keyword>Retinal Degeneration</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>3164273</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0014-4835(88)80055-1</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd) is a recessively inherited visual cell  disease. Neither the genetic abnormality nor the corresponding biochemical defect have yet been identified. Unique abnormalities of visual cell structure, function and renewal, however, characterize the disease phenotype and act as a marker for the prcd gene. The disease was first described in miniature poodle dogs (MP) but broadly similar retinal degenerations have been recognized, clinically, in other breeds. Crossbreeding experiments with prcd-affected MP and retinal degenerate English (ECS) and American (ACS) cocker spaniels now demonstrate that all the progeny are affected with a retinal degeneration indistinguishable from prcd in the MP. This indicates that the gene mutation in each breed is at the same (prcd) locus. In purebred prcd-affected ECS (prcd-ECS), however, the disease phenotype consistently differs from that in prcd-MP in its rate of progression and in the topographical distribution of disease within the retina. Ultrastructural variation in disease expression are also recognizable between the two phenotypes. These differences in disease phenotype may be ascribable to different genetic backgrounds in the two breeds, reflecting the effect of modifying genes, or may indicate separate, allelic, mutations at the same locus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Löscher, W</author><author>Schwartz-Porsche, D</author><author>Frey, H H</author><author>Schmidt, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of epileptic dogs as an animal model of human epilepsy.</title><secondary-title>Arzneimittel-Forschung</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arzneimittel-Forschung</full-title></periodical><pages>82-87</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anticonvulsants</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epilepsy</keyword><keyword>Evaluation Studies as Topic</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Half-Life</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year></dates><accession-num>4039156</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In 126 epileptic dogs with spontaneously recurring generalized tonic-clonic  (grand mal) seizures, epidemiological aspects and the efficacy of chronic oral treatment with common antiepileptic drugs were studied. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs in dogs was compared with the values known for man. As in man, idiopathic epilepsy appeared to be more common than symptomatic epilepsy in dogs. There was a preponderance of male vs. female animals. When the breeds of the epileptic dogs were compared to the distribution of breeds in the hospital population, breed-related differences in the prevalence of epilepsy were found. The highest prevalence was seen in Cocker spaniels, Miniature schnauzers, Collies and Bassets. The total prevalence of dogs with epilepsy was 0.55%. Comparison of pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs showed that some drugs were suited for maintenance therapy in dogs (primidone, phenobarbital, ethosuximide, trimethadione) whereas others appeared not to be ideally suited because of their short half-lives (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam). This was confirmed by the evaluation of antiepileptic drug efficacy in epileptic dogs. 46 dogs were treated with primidone at daily doses of 14-104 mg/kg for 6-60 months. During medication with primidone, effective plasma levels of its metabolite phenobarbital could be maintained. Complete control of seizures or a reduction of seizure frequency by at least 75% was achieved in 39% of the dogs at phenobarbital concentrations of 5-49 micrograms/ml. Similar figures were obtained during chronic treatment with phenobarbital at daily doses of 2.5-13 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phillips, V</author><author>Neves, J</author><author>Pedro, B</author><author>Linney, C</author><author>Griffin, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomography diagnosis of a caval-azygos communication in a dog with cor  triatriatum dexter.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-66</pages><volume>38</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cor Triatriatum</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34801805</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2021.10.002</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>An 18-month-old Springer Spaniel was presented for investigation of ascites,  exercise intolerance and suspected cor triatriatum dexter. Division of the right atrium into two separate chambers by an anomalous perforated membrane consistent with cor triatriatum dexter was confirmed during echocardiography. However, a routine agitated saline contrast (bubble) study yielded results that could not be explained by the congenital heart defect alone. Computed tomography angiography was performed and revealed a dilated ventral internal vertebral venous plexus and a short, dilated vessel in the midlumbar region redirecting blood flow away from the caudal vena cava and into the azygos vein. Balloon dilatation of the orifice within the cor triatriatum dexter membrane successfully reduced pressure within the caudal chamber of the right atrium and enhanced return via the caudal vena cava with subsequent resolution of clinical signs. This case report highlights the use of cross-sectional imaging in dogs with cor triatriatum dexter and unexpected contrast study results, as a means by which concurrent vascular anomalies may be identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burgess, Hilary J</author><author>MacDonald Dickinson, Valerie</author><author>Kerr, Moira</author><author>Bienzle, Dorothee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Marginal zone lymphoma in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>312-318</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32524625</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vcp.12874</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 13-year-old spayed female American Cocker Spaniel was presented for evaluation  of a cough and weight loss.

A narcolepsy-cataplexy episode with associated hypertension and bradycardia was triggered during examination. There was no evidence of arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the episode. Hematology, serum biochemistry, and thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable. MRI of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were compatible with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affecting the mesencephalon, pons and rostral medulla oblongata. The dog was started on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside, which was subsequently switched to cyclosporine. Narcolepsy-cataplexy episodes could initially still be triggered by offering food; however, they gradually became shorter and less frequent until they completely subsided along with all other clinical signs after 3 wk. No relapse occurred over a 32 mo follow-up period from the diagnosis. Repeated MRI revealed marked reduction in the lesion size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormalities. Although very rare, symptomatic narcolepsy/cataplexy can occur in dogs and can be secondary to brainstem encephalitis. Cardiovascular changes can occur in association with narcolepsy/cataplexy and should be considered when dealing with patients presenting with these specific clinical signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Espino, Luciano</author><author>Suarez, Maruska</author><author>Santamarina, German</author><author>Vila, Mónica</author><author>Miño, Natalia</author><author>Lopez-Peña, Mónica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First report of the simultaneous occurrence of choroid plexus papilloma and  meningioma in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</full-title></periodical><pages>389-397</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Meningioma</keyword><keyword>Papilloma, Choroid Plexus</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19635711</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1556/AVet.57.2009.3.5</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7-year-old spayed female English Cocker Spaniel was examined because of a  1-week history of lethargy, stumbling over objects and circling, and the presence of two tonic-clonic generalised seizures two days before presentation.

Computed tomography revealed the presence of two intracranial masses, one located inside the right lateral ventricle and the other located in the right frontal lobe attached to the falx cerebri. Because of the poor prognosis, the owner refused to continue with the therapy and the dog was euthanised. On postmortem examination one mass was diagnosed histologically as a meningioma and the other as a papilloma of the choroid plexus.

The focus of work in many models of veterinary behavioural medicine has predominantly been associated with reducing activation of the protective emotional systems; in particular, fear-anxiety. The management of the engaging emotional systems of desire-seeking, social play, care and lust has not traditionally been considered in the treatment of physiological health of veterinary species. This article reviews the literature in both veterinary and human fields on the relationship between emotional arousal of both protective and engaging emotional systems and physical health conditions. The current literature describing the regulatory control of sleep on emotional arousal is also discussed. An exemplary case report of a seven month old male entire Cocker Spaniel showing fly-snapping behaviour which had been non-responsive to leviteracetam (Keppra) is presented. The emotional health assessment and treatment of this case is described along with the short and long term (fourteen month follow up) outcomes to demonstrate that some patients presenting in this way can be effectively managed with an appropriate behavioural medicine treatment plan. The authors put forward the argument that an emotional health assessment should be considered an essential component of the work up of all such cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomas-Hollands, Alison</author><author>Shelton, G Diane</author><author>Guo, Ling T</author><author>Loughran, Kerry</author><author>Kaiman, Gregory</author><author>A Hutton, Tabitha</author><author>Walsh, Koranda A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital dyserythropoiesis and polymyopathy without cardiac disease in male  Labrador retriever littermates.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2409-2414</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Bone Marrow</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electromyography</keyword><keyword>Heart Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34227150</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16214</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Two Labrador retriever littermates were identified based on  incidentally noted marked microcytosis and inappropriate metarubricytosis. Muscle atrophy was noted and associated with distinctive pathological findings in biopsy samples from 1 dog studied. The disorder represents a rare clinical entity of suspected congenital dyserythropoiesis and polymyopathy. Clinicopathologic changes were similar to a previously reported syndrome of congenital dyserythropoiesis, congenital polymyopathy, and cardiac disease in 3 related English Springer Spaniel (ESS) dogs, but the dogs reported here did not have apparent cardiac disease. INTERVENTIONS: Bone marrow aspiration, electromyography, muscle biopsies, and an echocardiogram were performed on dog 1. Results supported dyserythropoiesis and congenital polymyopathy similar to reports in ESS dogs, but did not identify obvious cardiac disease. CONCLUSION: The clinicopathologic changes of dyserythropoiesis and polymyopathy provide an easily recognizable phenotype for what appears to be a low morbidity syndrome. Early recognition may decrease unnecessary testing or euthanasia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mcclaran, Janet Kovak</author><author>Pavia, Philippa</author><author>Fischetti, Anthony J</author><author>Donovan, Taryn A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Laparoscopic Resection of a Pancreatic β Cell Tumor in a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>338-345</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Insulin-Secreting Cells</keyword><keyword>Insulinoma</keyword><keyword>Laparoscopy</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</keyword><keyword>Pancreatectomy</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28892425</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6417</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Laparoscopic partial pancreatectomy has been performed in experimental canine  studies and has been evaluated in human medicine but has not been reported in a clinical veterinary case. The authors present a 9 yr old field spaniel with weakness and hypoglycemia with insulin levels and Amended Insulin: Glucose Ratio results equivocal for a pancreatic insulinoma. Multiple abdominal ultrasounds did not detect the tumor, yet dual-phase computed tomographic angiography revealed the presence of a focal hypoattenuating nodule in the left lobe of the pancreas. A 3-port laparoscopic approach to the abdomen confirmed a 1.5-cm mass in the mid-left limb of the pancreas, and resection of the mass was performed with a bipolar vessel-sealing device.

Final histopathology results revealed pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the β cells. Recurrence of hypoglycemia was noted 18 mo postoperatively; however, repeat computed tomographic angiography did not reveal pancreatic abnormalities and fine needle aspirates of liver nodules did not suggest metastatic disease. Medical management was elected and the patient was euthanized 28 mo after surgery due to refractory hypoglycemic seizures.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tong, L J</author><author>Bennett, S L</author><author>Thompson, D J</author><author>Adsett, S L</author><author>Shiel, R E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Right-sided congestive heart failure in a dog because of a primary intracavitary  myocardial lymphoma.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>67-71</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Heart Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25708789</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/avj.12289</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE REPORT: A 9-year-old female intact Cocker Spaniel was presented with a  history of acute-onset dyspnoea and abdominal distension of 3 days' duration. Ultrasonography revealed pleural, peritoneal and pericardial effusions. Abdominal fluid analysis was consistent with a modified transudate. Echocardiography revealed a large, hypoechoic space-occupying mass within the right atrium. The dog was euthanased and the postmortem examination showed a solid, 40 × 35 × 20 mm broad-based mass arising from the right atrial wall and occluding approximately 90% of the right atrial lumen. Histopathology revealed myocardial lymphoma. There were histologically similar, focal nodules in the lung parenchyma without involvement of other extracardiac sites. There was gross and histological evidence of hepatic congestion and marked distension of the caudal vena cava, consistent with secondary right-sided congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the need to consider lymphoma as a differential diagnosis for an intra-atrial mass and as a cause of congestive heart failure in the dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nekovarova, Tereza</author><author>Fajnerova, Iveta</author><author>Horacek, Jiri</author><author>Spaniel, Filip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bridging disparate symptoms of schizophrenia: a triple network dysfunction  theory.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>171</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24910597</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00171</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with variable  symptomatology, traditionally divided into positive and negative symptoms, and cognitive deficits. However, the etiology of this disorder has yet to be fully understood. Recent findings suggest that alteration of the basic sense of self-awareness may be an essential distortion of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In addition, extensive research of social and mentalizing abilities has stressed the role of distortion of social skills in schizophrenia.This article aims to propose and support a concept of a triple brain network model of the dysfunctional switching between default mode and central executive network (CEN) related to the aberrant activity of the salience network. This model could represent a unitary mechanism of a wide array of symptom domains present in schizophrenia including the deficit of self (self-awareness and self-representation) and theory of mind (ToM) dysfunctions along with the traditional positive, negative and cognitive domains. We review previous studies which document the dysfunctions of self and ToM in schizophrenia together with neuroimaging data that support the triple brain network model as a common neuronal substrate of this dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vrabelova, D</author><author>Silvestrini, P</author><author>Ciudad, J</author><author>Gimenez, J C</author><author>Ballesteros, M</author><author>Puig, P</author><author>Ruiz de Gopegui, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of 2735 canine uroliths in Spain and Portugal.

The results of quantitative analysis from Minnesota Urolith Center (MUC) were compared with that from other countries and interrelations of mineral composition, age, breed, and gender were determined. The most frequent calculus was calcium oxalate (38.1%) followed by struvite (32.9%). Eighty-three breeds plus crossbreeds (25%) were identified. In all of them, but Dalmatians, calcium oxalate and struvite accounted for 71-78%. The mean age of urolith appearance was 7.6 years. There was a significant difference in the frequency of different uroliths composition among the six most common breeds presenting urolithiasis in Spain and Portugal (Yorkshire terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, Cocker Spaniel, Poodle, Shih Tzu and Dalmatian). This is the first report on xanthine urolithiasis found in Spain. Prevalence of cystine calculi was significantly lower (3.2%) than that reported previously in parts of Spain (26%).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Munday, J S</author><author>French, A F</author><author>MacNamara, A R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The development of multiple cutaneous inverted papilloma following  ovariohysterectomy in a dog.</title><secondary-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Zealand veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>168-171</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hysterectomy</keyword><keyword>Ovariectomy</keyword><keyword>Papilloma, Inverted</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20514092</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00480169.2010.67519</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE HISTORY: Ovariohysterectomy was performed on an adult Cavalier King Charles  Spaniel. The skin that had been clipped for surgery was noticed to be erythematous 8 days later. CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Poorly defined patches containing multiple papules were visible bilaterally within the clipped skin. These became larger over the following 2 weeks, and samples were collected for histology. Seven days later, the lesions were multiple raised masses, up to 5 cm in diameter. Histology revealed numerous cup-shaped epidermal proliferations extending into the dermis. The presence of keratinocytes with increased quantities of blue-grey cytoplasm, and koilocytosis suggested papillomaviral infection; Canis familiaris papillomavirus (CfPV-2) DNA was amplified from two separate samples. Complete regression was observed 8 weeks after the lesions had been initially observed. DIAGNOSIS: Multiple inverted papilloma confined to skin that had been clipped for surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the first time that the development of canine cutaneous papillomas has been associated with surgery. The nature of the association between surgery and development of the papillomas is uncertain. However, it is possible that damage to superficial skin could promote the formation of papillomas. This is the first identification of CfPV-2 in New Zealand.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riegel, Casey M</author><author>Stockham, Steven L</author><author>Patton, Kristin M</author><author>Thomas, Casey L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is your diagnosis?

The fluid was yellow, cloudy, and slightly gelatinous, and had a total protein concentration of 2.8 g/dL, a total nucleated cell concentration of 1.1 x 10(3)/microL, and a triglyceride concentration of 177 mg/dL. A cytocentrifuged preparation contained a mixed inflammatory cell population with a predominance of small lymphocytes and abundant mucinous material in the background. The dog died 3 days later and a mass was found within the lumen and wall of the right auricle of the heart at necropsy. Histopathologic sections of the mass contained a population of anaplastic spindle cells diffusely suspended in a pale basophilic matrix, consistent with myxosarcoma. The cells were positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, desmin, and von Willebrand factor VIII-related antigen. A myxoid matrix was confirmed by positive staining with Alcian blue. Myxosarcoma is a rare cardiac tumor in dogs that should be considered, along with mucus-producing carcinomas and bile, as a cause of muculent effusion.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Naughton, James F</author><author>Tucker, Russell L</author><author>Bagley, Rodney S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Radiographic diagnosis--paraspinal abscess in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary radiology &amp; ultrasound : the official journal of the American College  of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association</full-title></periodical><pages>23-26</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Abscess</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Lumbar Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Compression</keyword><keyword>Spinal Diseases</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15693554</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1740-8261.2005.00004.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A two-year-old intact male Brittany Spaniel was admitted for evaluation of  progressive spinal pain. Previous treatment had been initiated for suspected lumbosacral intervertebral disk disease, however there was poor response to therapy. On presentation the dog was laterally recumbent and neurological examination revealed hyperesthesia over the lumbar vertebral segments. On survey radiography there was loss of detail in the sublumbar fascial planes and inconclusive lumbar vertebra proliferation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to better evaluate the lumbar spine and surrounding tissues, which revealed extensive paralumbar cellulitis, abscessation and osteomyelitis with extradural compression of the spinal cord. MR imaging allowed delineation of the abscessed area, and distinct visualization of its extension into and involvement of the surrounding tissues including muscle, fat, and retroperitoneal structures. In this case, MR imaging was instrumental in defining the extent of the infection and determining whether medical or surgical management of the diseased tissue was necessary. If available, MR may be the imaging method of choice for evaluation of paraspinal abscesses yielding a better insight to the spinal structures involved and facilitating medical or surgical intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pullium, J K</author><author>Dillehay, D L</author><author>Webb, S</author><author>Pinter, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital bilateral ureteral stenosis and hydronephrosis in a neonatal puppy.</title><secondary-title>Contemporary topics in laboratory animal science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contemporary topics in laboratory animal science</full-title></periodical><pages>34-36</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Animals, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Histocytochemistry</keyword><keyword>Hydronephrosis</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Ureter</keyword><keyword>Ureteral Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Urothelium</keyword><keyword>Weight Gain</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11040873</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Three days after an uneventful parturition, a Brittany spaniel/beagle puppy  (Canis familiaris) was nursing but not gaining weight as rapidly as were its littermates. Although its diet was supplemented, the puppy died 10 days after birth. The renal pelves were enlarged and filled with urine. Both ureters were thin throughout their length, and urine could not be expressed from either kidney into its respective ureter. The bladder contained no urine and was firmly embedded in the umbilicus. Histologically, both kidneys were hydronephrotic and contained hypoplastic collecting tubules. The diameter of the right (0.55 mm) and left (0.57 mm) ureters at the uteropelvic junction were narrower than those of an age-matched control of the same breed (1.03 mm and 1.02 mm) and were lined by hypoplastic urothelium. Trichrome staining of the ureters revealed excessive collagen and disorganized smooth muscle fibers; in contrast, the control had predominantly circular smooth muscle fibers and less fibrous tissue. Although neither blood nor aqueous humor could be evaluated for urea nitrogen, we suspect that the puppy died from uremia. The congenital bilateral ureteral stenosis and hydronephrosis of the described puppy is similar to a form of uteropelvic obstruction in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owen, Jennifer L</author><author>Harvey, John W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hemolytic anemia in dogs and cats due to erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary clinics of North America.

In addition, erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies are uncommon or rare, so they are generally not seriously considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia until common causes of anemia have been excluded. However, unique clinical and/or laboratory findings like sporadic hemoglobinuria in English Springer spaniels (PFK deficiency) may quickly point to the possibility of an inherited erythrocyte enzyme defect. The ability to diagnose deficient or carrier animals allows for the possibility of eliminating these undesirable traits in future breeding. Continued research is needed to document additional enzyme deficiencies that likely occur and to develop additional DNA-based assays that are especially important in the recognition of heterozygous or carrier animals that have no clinical signs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hansson, K</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Kvart, C</author><author>Lord, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reader performance in radiographic diagnosis of signs of mitral regurgitation in  cavalier King Charles spaniels.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>44-53</pages><volume>50 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiomegaly</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Observer Variation</keyword><keyword>ROC Curve</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Reference Standards</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19765219</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00669.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To measure accuracy and variability of diagnosis by radiography of  heart enlargement (HE) and heart failure (HF) in mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS: Sixteen readers representing four levels of experience evaluated 50 sets of radiographs with varying severity of MR for presence or absence of HE, left atrial enlargement (LAE) and HF. The performance of the readers was compared with a reference standard, using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The interreader agreement value kappa (K) was calculated. A subset of difficult cases of HF was analysed before and after removing an outlying reader from each group. RESULTS: AUC for HE was 0.89, for LAE it was 0.93 and for HF it was 0.92. Experience increased certainty of diagnosis but not accuracy. K ranges were HE, 0.53 to 0.67; LAE, 0.61 to 0.69 and HF, 0.49 to 0.58. When only difficult cases of HF were read, accuracy decreased and experienced readers performed better than inexperienced. When outlying readers were excluded, the differences between experienced and inexperienced readers increased. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: LAE, not HE, should be used to evaluate the heart size and indirectly the severity of MR on radiographs. For HF, agreement among individual readers was only moderate. Studies of reader accuracy should consider the effects of interreader variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, J P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>C3-like activity in C3-deficient dog serum.</title><secondary-title>Complement (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Complement (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><pages>53-60</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Complement C3</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Edetic Acid</keyword><keyword>Hemolytic Plaque Technique</keyword><keyword>Hot Temperature</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Methylamines</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>deficiency</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>3105954</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000463007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A complete absence of the third component of complement has been demonstrated in  a colony of Brittany spaniels. The deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is clinically characterized by an increased susceptibility to infection and renal disease. Despite having no detectable antigenic C3, C3-deficient dog serum has approximately 10% of normal serum C3 hemolytic activity. This report characterizes the nature of the C3-like activity in C3-deficient dog serum. The activity is inhibited by heating serum to 56 degrees C for 30 min and by incubation in 0.01 M EDTA. The activity is also sensitive to both methylamine and D-76, in a dose-dependent fashion. The lytic activity in C3-deficient dog serum appears to be complement mediated. Furthermore, lysis of EAC1,4,oxy2 cells by deficient dog serum is inhibited by methylamine. Although lysis is boosted by the addition of purified C5, a greater boost is obtained in the absence of methylamine. Therefore, there exists a methylamine-sensitive protein other than C4 in C3-deficient dog serum which interacts with C5. It is possible that this protein may be a newly discovered complement protein for which appropriate conditions for its detection have not previously been available.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adler, E</author><author>Tidholm, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of mitral valve regurgitation in 102 asymptomatic Chinese Crested  dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>55-61</pages><volume>46</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>37058906</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2022.09.006</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the main features of myxomatous  mitral valve disease (MMVD), which is the most common heart disease in dogs. Myxomatous mitral valve disease affects many small breed dogs, and some breeds such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Dachshunds, Yorkshire terriers, and Miniature Schnauzers have been studied more in detail. Breed-specific information regarding MMVD is valuable for providing appropriate advice on management and breeding. Data, based on insurance statistics in Sweden, show that Chinese Crested dogs (CCD) are twice as likely to visit the veterinarian for a heart-related problem than other breeds. ANIMALS: One-hundred two privately owned, healthy CCD were recruited via the Swedish CCD club. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, in which clinical examinations, blood pressure measurements, and echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were performed in all dogs. Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging was performed in 87 dogs. RESULTS: Mitral regurgitation was present in 39 (38%) dogs, whereas a systolic murmur was present in 35 (34%) dogs. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 32 (31%) dogs. Tricuspid regurgitation was found in 29 (28%) dogs. Dogs in the MR group were older (median 9.5 years), and males were overrepresented compared with the non-MR group. Differences were also found between groups regarding left atrial size and transmitral E wave velocity. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MR in CCD is similar to reports in other small breeds. Whether the MR detected in these dogs is a sign of MMVD is unknown.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarnow, I</author><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Jensen, M B</author><author>Pedersen, K-M</author><author>Pedersen, H D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determinants of weak femoral artery pulse in dogs with mitral valve prolapse.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>113-120</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aorta</keyword><keyword>Blood Flow Velocity</keyword><keyword>Blood Pressure</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography, Doppler</keyword><keyword>Electrocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Femoral Artery</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Prolapse</keyword><keyword>Platelet Count</keyword><keyword>Pulse</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography, Doppler</keyword><keyword>Videotape Recording</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>14672853</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rvsc.2003.10.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In three substudies encompassing 247 dogs from two breeds predisposed to  myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), femoral artery pulse strength was palpated and related to potential explanatory factors, including quantitative echocardiographic measures of MMVD, aortic and femoral artery diameter and wall thickness and blood pressure. In addition, in 109 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (of which 61 were included in the three substudies mentioned above), the relation between femoral artery pulse strength and presence of thrombocytopenia was investigated. In 26% of the dogs, a pulse &lt;/=50% of normal strength was detected; six dogs (2.0%) had an absent pulse unilaterally or bilaterally. Mitral valve prolapse severity, degree of obesity, heart rate and age all influenced femoral artery pulse strength negatively. Weak femoral artery pulses were not related to clinical signs or to decreased pulse pressure or stroke volume. A weak femoral artery pulse reflected reduced artery diameter and/or distension rather than occlusion.

SAMPLE POPULATION: Medical records from 283 dogs with confirmed CPV enteritis and from 834 age-matched control dogs that were healthy or had been admitted with nonenteric illness. PROCEDURE: Effects of season, breed, sex, and neutering on the risk of developing CPV enteritis were examined by calculation of unadjusted odds ratios and performance of multivariate analysis. Stratified and contingency table analyses were performed to identify interactions and confounding among variables. RESULTS: Rottweilers, American Pit Bull Terriers, Doberman Pinschers, and German Shepherd Dogs were at increased risk and Toy Poodles and Cocker Spaniels were at decreased risk for developing CPV enteritis, compared with that for mixed-breed dogs. For dogs more than 6 months old, sexually intact males were twice as likely as intact females to develop CPV enteritis. Dogs were 3 times more likely to be admitted with CPV enteritis in July, August, and September, compared with the rest of the year. Dogs were 12.7 times more likely to be admitted with CPV enteritis if they had not been currently vaccinated. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Lack of vaccination is a significant risk factor for development of CPV enteritis. Seasonal, sex, and breed predispositions for the development of CPV enteritis also exist.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knowler, Susan P</author><author>Cross, Chloe</author><author>Griffiths, Sandra</author><author>McFadyen, Angus K</author><author>Jovanovik, Jelena</author><author>Tauro, Anna</author><author>Kibar, Zoha</author><author>Driver, Colin J</author><author>La Ragione, Roberto M</author><author>Rusbridge, Clare</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of Morphometric Mapping to Characterise Symptomatic Chiari-Like Malformation,  Secondary Syringomyelia and Associated Brachycephaly in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0170315</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cephalometry</keyword><keyword>Cervical Vertebrae</keyword><keyword>Craniosynostoses</keyword><keyword>Discriminant Analysis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foramen Magnum</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Observer Variation</keyword><keyword>Olfactory Bulb</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Rhombencephalon</keyword><keyword>Skull</keyword><keyword>Skull Base</keyword><keyword>Syringomyelia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28122014</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0170315</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To characterise the symptomatic phenotype of Chiari-like malformation  (CM), secondary syringomyelia (SM) and brachycephaly in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel using morphometric measurements on mid-sagittal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) of the brain and craniocervical junction. METHODS: This retrospective study, based on a previous quantitative analysis in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB), used 24 measurements taken on 130 T1-weighted MRI of hindbrain and cervical region. Associated brachycephaly was estimated using 26 measurements, including rostral forebrain flattening and olfactory lobe rotation, on 72 T2-weighted MRI of the whole brain. Both study cohorts were divided into three groups; Control, CM pain and SM and their morphometries compared with each other. RESULTS: Fourteen significant traits were identified in the hindbrain study and nine traits in the whole brain study, six of which were similar to the GB and suggest a common aetiology. The Control cohort had the most elliptical brain (p = 0.010), least olfactory bulb rotation (p = 0.003) and a protective angle (p = 0.004) compared to the other groups. The CM pain cohort had the greatest rostral forebrain flattening (p = 0.007), shortest basioccipital (p = 0.019), but a greater distance between the atlas and basioccipital (p = 0.002) which was protective for SM. The SM cohort had two conformation anomalies depending on the severity of craniocervical junction incongruities; i) the proximity of the dens (p &lt;0.001) ii) increased airorhynchy with a smaller, more ventrally rotated olfactory bulb (p &lt;0.001). Both generated 'concertina' flexures of the brain and craniocervical junction. CONCLUSION: Morphometric mapping provides a diagnostic tool for quantifying symptomatic CM, secondary SM and their relationship with brachycephaly. It is hypothesized that CM pain is associated with increased brachycephaly and SM can result from different combinations of abnormalities of the forebrain, caudal fossa and craniocervical junction which compromise the neural parenchyma and impede cerebrospinal fluid flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Talbot, Cindy</author><author>Kearns, Shawn</author><author>Mouser, Pamela J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treatment of Superficial Necrolytic Dermatitis with Copper Chelationina Dog with  Copper-Associated Hepatitis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1-6</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Copper</keyword><keyword>Dermatitis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Hepatitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Skin Diseases</keyword><keyword>Trientine</keyword><keyword>chemically induced</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><accession-num>36584317</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7217</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 7 yr old castrated male Cavalier King Charles spaniel presented for evaluation  of liver enzyme elevations. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small liver with mixed echogenicity, small hypoechoic nodules, and an irregular surface. Histologic examination and copper quantification of the liver obtained by laparoscopy diagnosed copper-associated hepatitis. One month later the dog developed hyperkeratosis of all four foot pads and ulcerations of feet, legs, and rectum. Punch biopsies confirmed superficial necrolytic dermatitis. After a total of 2 mo of chelation with no changes to medications, skin lesions began to improve, continuing over the following 6 wk to almost complete resolution. At this point the skin lesions returned and had minimal response to four amino acids infusions. The dog was switched from penicillamine to trientine. Zinc acetate was initiated 6 wk after the switch to trientine, and skin improvement was noted soon thereafter. At the time of death, skin lesions were improving and the dog was clinically comfortable. Copper-associated hepatitis should be considered as a possible etiology for superficial necrolytic dermatitis. Treatment of superficial necrolytic dermatitis is often unrewarding, and copper chelation, when copper-associated hepatitis has been confirmed, represents another therapeutic option.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slaughter, Sarah A</author><author>Eitzer, Andrew D</author><author>Tolliver, Sara E</author><author>Holman, Sarah N</author><author>Colopy, Sara A</author><author>Hoey, Seamus E</author><author>Loeber, Samantha J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computed tomography of testicular torsion in a juvenile dog with unilateral  cryptorchidism.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>515-520</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cryptorchidism</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Spermatic Cord Torsion</keyword><keyword>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</keyword><keyword>Ultrasonography</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35502260</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 14-week-old male unilaterally cryptorchid Clumber spaniel was presented for  acute lethargy. Physical examination revealed abdominal pain, and a single testis was palpated in the scrotum. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) revealed a poorly vascularized, ovoid structure immediately caudal to the left kidney with scant regional peritoneal effusion. Left intra-abdominal testicular torsion was confirmed at surgery, and routine cryptorchidectomy was performed. The patient recovered uneventfully from anesthesia and surgery. Key clinical message: The most common CT characteristics of testicular torsion were present in this case and correlated well with sonographic findings to allow for rapid, accurate diagnosis and surgical planning of unilateral, non-neoplastic, intra-abdominal cryptorchid testicular torsion in a juvenile dog. Contrast enhanced CT facilitated accurate localization of the undescended testis and evaluation of testicular perfusion and may be a useful alternative to ultrasound for diagnosing testicular torsion, especially in indeterminate cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Araki, Ryuji</author><author>Iwanaga, Koji</author><author>Ueda, Kazunori</author><author>Isaka, Mitsuhiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnosis of Isolated Cleft of the Anterior Mitral Leaflet in a Dog: A Case Study  Using Real-Time Three-Dimensional Echocardiography.</title><secondary-title>Case reports in veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Case reports in veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>6610526</pages><volume>2021</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33575059</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2021/6610526</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Isolated cleft of the anterior mitral leaflet (ICAML) in dogs without a septal  defect is a rare pathological condition. Until now, only one paper has contributed to the detailed understanding of canine ICAML. Reports have confirmed that 3-dimensional echocardiography (3-DE) is a simple and fast imaging technique that is useful for the diagnosis of ICAML and morphological evaluation of the mitral valve in humans. However, to our knowledge, no studies have provided details about the effectiveness of 3-DE in ICAML diagnosis in dogs. Thus, we aimed to determine the usefulness of a diagnostic technique using 3-DE in a 2-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with ICAML that exhibited mild mitral valve regurgitation. ICAML was initially assessed by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography. A diagnosis of congenital mitral regurgitation due to ICAML and understanding of the morphological structure of the valve was established based on the 3-DE findings.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saitoh, Yuya</author><author>Aikawa, Takeshi</author><author>Miyazaki, Yuta</author><author>Nishimura, Masaaki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-Term Outcome After Surgical Resection of a Spinal Choroid Plexus Tumor in a  Dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association</full-title></periodical><pages>37-41</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Choroid Plexus Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Glioma</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Spinal Cord Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33260214</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6982</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 6 yr old castrated male Clumber spaniel was referred for evaluation of acute  paraplegia. MRI of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated an intradural-extramedullary mass lesion at the level of T12 and extradural spinal cord compression at L1-L2. A hemilaminectomy was performed to achieve gross total resection of the mass lesion and removal of extruded disc material. A diagnosis of spinal choroid plexus tumor (CPT) and intervertebral disc extrusion was made. At 4 mo postoperatively, MRI demonstrated a mass lesion at the right lateral aperture of the fourth ventricle. Spinal drop metastasis from a primary intracranial CPT was suspected. The dog was ambulating independently and neurologically normal at that time. At 17 mo postoperatively, a third MRI was performed owing to decreased postural reactions in both hind limbs and vision loss in the right eye, and it demonstrated an increase in size of the intracranial mass lesion. These two additional MRI studies of the entire central nervous system showed no other metastatic lesions nor any evidence of local recurrence. At 25 mo postoperatively, the dog died at home. This is the first case report of surgical intervention and antemortem histopathological diagnosis of a spinal CPT in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ortinau, Nora</author><author>Vitale, Samantha</author><author>Akin, Erin Y</author><author>Beasley, Michaela</author><author>Shores, Andy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Foramen magnum decompression surgery in 23 Chiari-like malformation patients  2007-2010: outcomes and owner survey results.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne</full-title></periodical><pages>288-291</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arnold-Chiari Malformation</keyword><keyword>Decompression, Surgical</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25750451</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Chiari-like malformation (CLM) with syringomyelia (SM) in dogs is particularly  prominent in the Cavalier King Charles spaniel breed, but has also been reported in several other small breed dogs. Over a period of 3 years, 23 canine patients were treated surgically for CLM-SM. Surgery consisted of foramen magnum decompression, durotomy, duraplasty, and free autogenous adipose tissue grafting (fat graft). All patients were re-evaluated clinically at least 1 month after surgery and some up to 3 years after surgery. Improvement was noted on all clinical evaluations. A questionnaire was mailed to all 23 owners after a period of at least 1 year after surgery. Seventeen surveys were returned. No patient has required additional surgery to date, 94% (16/17) had some improvement in quality of life after surgery, and none were judged to deteriorate to less than the pre-surgical status. The authors conclude that this surgical procedure, combined with medical therapy, resulted in favorable long-term outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pliusnin, A Z</author><author>Nolandt, O V</author><author>Kuznetsova, E V</author><author>Briantseva, E A</author><author>Fridman, E A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Molecular hybridization of nucleic acids as a method for the laboratory  diagnosis of influenza in model experiments on cell cultures and in research on nasopharyngeal smears obtained from patients].</title><secondary-title>Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii i immunobiologii</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii i immunobiologii</full-title></periodical><pages>19-23</pages><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cells, Cultured</keyword><keyword>Chick Embryo</keyword><keyword>DNA Probes</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Influenza A virus</keyword><keyword>Influenza, Human</keyword><keyword>Methods</keyword><keyword>Nasopharynx</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Hybridization</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral</keyword><keyword>Virus Cultivation</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>microbiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>2461622</accession-num><language>rus</language><urls/><abstract>DNA probes containing the nucleotide sequences of the conservative genes of  influenza A virus (matrix, nucleoprotein and acidic polymerase genes) show their specificity with respect to the RNA of influenza A viruses in mammal tissue cell cultures (continuous spaniel kidney cell culture and primary calf kidney cell culture).

METHODS: Relapse-prone outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to the active (n=75) or control group (n=71). In the active arm, according to the protocol, investigators were prompted to increase the antipsychotic dose upon occurrence of a pharmacological inter vention requiring event (PIRE) detected by ITAREPS. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis found no between-group difference in the hospitalization-free survival rate at 12 months. However, the trial suffered from high non-adherence of investigators in the active group, with no antipsychotic dose increase in 61% of PIREs. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis showed a 11-fold increased risk of hospitalization in the absence of pharmacological intervention following a PIRE (hazard ratio [HR]=10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-80.0; p=0.002). Therefore, a post-hoc as-treated analysis was performed, which demonstrated a nine-fold reduction in the risk of hospitalization in ITAREPS Algorithm-Adherers (IAAs, n=25) compared with the ITAREPS Non-interventional group (INIs, n=70; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, HR=0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.28, p=0.009; number needed to treat [NNT]=4, 95% CI 3-10). A significant difference in favor of the IAA group was seen in the number of inpatient days (p&lt;0.05) and costs (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Future ITAREPS trials should target the underlying mechanisms that cause low investigator adherence to the program.

The second dog's fecal incontinence was associated with the anal mass. In both dogs, reconstruction of the external anal sphincter was required to gain fecal continence. Especially in the dog with an anal mass, the whole musculature involved in fecal continence was removed with the affected anorectum. Conventional surgical treatments for fecal incontinence have limitations in terms of muscle flap length and complexity of the surgical procedure. A modified surgical technique using the semitendinosus muscle was devised in the present study to overcome these limitations. The distal part of the semitendinosus muscle was bifurcated to make two muscle bundles, used to completely encircle the anorectum. These muscle bundles were sutured to the surrounding rectal muscle and the pelvic diaphragm to simulate the function of the external anal sphincter. Three months after surgery, both dogs showed significantly improved fecal continence without severe complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or lameness of the limb where the semitendinosus muscle was harvested. The outcomes of the two dogs supported the acceptability of the bifurcated muscle flap for anal sphincter augmentation. In addition, this report showed the possibility of more diverse applications of semitendinosus muscle in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carrozza, Rossella</author><author>Lenihan, Emer</author><author>Hamzianpour, Negar</author><author>Linn-Pearl, Rose</author><author>Heinrich, Christine</author><author>Walsh, Karen</author><author>Grundon, Rachael A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lower lid entropion in dogs: A modified technique of the combined Hotz-Celsus and  wedge resection procedure.</title><secondary-title>The Veterinary record</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Veterinary record</full-title></periodical><pages>e1383</pages><volume>190</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Entropion</keyword><keyword>Eyelids</keyword><keyword>Operative Time</keyword><keyword>Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Surgical Wound</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35092709</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/vetr.1383</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe a modification of the combined  Hotz-Celsus and wedge resection technique for the treatment of lower lid entropion in dogs and evaluate its success rate. METHODS: To reduce tissue trauma, facilitate tissue handling and shorten the surgical time, shortening of the eyelid was performed by excising a rectangular piece of the eyelid margin only, in the central section, extending to but not below the first Hotz-Celsus incision. The eyelid margin surgical wound was then sutured before excision of the Hotz-Celsus crescent which had been surgically scored at the start of surgery. Records of 31 dogs were reviewed for signalment, outcome, need for further surgery, and follow up from 6 to 48 months after surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-one eyes with lower lid entropion were treated. The most common breeds were English bulldog and English cocker spaniel and the median age was 16 months. The success rate for a single entropion correction surgery was 98.4%. One eyelid required a second surgical correction and four eyelids of three large breed dogs had wound breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: This modified technique is successful at correcting lower eyelid entropion associated with overlong eyelid length in dogs while being technically easier to perform.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Furukawa, Sho</author><author>Meguri, Natsuko</author><author>Koura, Kazue</author><author>Koura, Hiroyuki</author><author>Matsuda, Akira</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Case of Canine Polyglandular Deficiency Syndrome with Diabetes Mellitus and  Hypoadrenocorticism.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33800028</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/vetsci8030043</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This report describes the first clinical case, to our knowledge, of a dog with  polyglandular deficiency syndrome with diabetes mellitus and hypoadrenocorticism. A six-year-old female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with a history of lethargy and appetite loss. The dog was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis based on hyperglycemia and renal glucose and ketone body loss. The dog's condition improved on intensive treatment of diabetes mellitus; daily subcutaneous insulin detemir injection maintained an appropriate blood glucose level over half a year. However, the dog's body weight gradually decreased from day 207, and on day 501, it presented with a decreased appetite; the precise cause could not be determined. Based on mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, hypoadrenocorticism was suggested; the diagnosis was made using an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. Daily fludrocortisone with low-dose prednisolone oral administration resulted in poor recovery of the blood chemistry abnormalities; however, monthly desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) subcutaneous injection with daily low-dose prednisolone oral administration helped in the significant recovery of the abnormalities. Therefore, clinicians should consider the possibility of coexistence of hypoadrenocorticism in dogs with diabetes mellitus presenting with undifferentiated weight loss. Additionally, DOCP (not fludrocortisone) may be useful in treating dogs with diabetes mellitus complicated with hypoadrenocorticism.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butty, Emmanuelle Marie</author><author>Hahn, Shelley</author><author>Labato, Mary Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presumptive malignant transformation of chronic polypoid cystitis into an apical  transitional cell carcinoma without BRAF mutation in a young female dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1551-1557</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Transitional Cell</keyword><keyword>Cystitis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33739477</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvim.16107</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 3-year-old spayed female English Springer Spaniel was presented twice 4 months  apart for investigation of hematuria and pollakiuria without urinary tract infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two examiners performed gonioscopy in 98 eyes of 49 Welsh springer spaniel dogs and estimated the percentage circumference of iridocorneal angle affected by pectinate ligament abnormality to the nearest 5%. Percentage scores assigned to each eye by the two examiners were compared. Inter-examiner agreement was assessed following assignment of the percentage scores to each of four grading schemes by Cohen's kappa statistic. RESULTS: There was a strong positive correlation between the results of the two examiners (R=0·91). In general, Examiner 1 scored individual eyes higher than Examiner 2, especially for eyes in which both examiners diagnosed pectinate ligament abnormality. A &quot;good&quot; level of agreement could only be achieved with a gonioscopy grading scheme of no more than three categories and with a relatively large intermediate bandwidth (κ=0·68). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A three-tiered grading scheme might represent an improvement on hereditary eye disease schemes which simply classify dogs to be either &quot;affected&quot; or &quot;unaffected&quot; for pectinate ligament abnormality. However, the large intermediate bandwidth of this scheme would only allow for the additional detection of those dogs with marked progression of pectinate ligament abnormality which would be considered most at risk of primary closed-angle glaucoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vieitez, Verónica</author><author>Martín-Cuervo, María</author><author>López-Ramis, Víctor</author><author>Ezquerra, Luis Javier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acute upper airway obstruction due to retropharyngeal hematoma in a dog with  Anaplasma species: a case study.</title><secondary-title>BMC veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>257</pages><volume>11</volume><keywords><keyword>Anaplasmosis</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hematoma</keyword><keyword>Pharyngeal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Pharynx</keyword><keyword>Thrombocytopenia</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26452479</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12917-015-0574-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Retropharyngeal hematoma is a rare condition that is difficult to  diagnose and may progress rapidly to airway obstruction. The authors report the first known case of acute upper airway obstruction resulting from retropharyngeal hematoma in a dog. Documented causes in human medicine have included coagulopathic states, trauma, infection, parathyroid adenoma rupture, and foreign body ingestion. Vague symptoms in humans such as sore throat, shortness of breath, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling may precede lethal airway obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors report a case of an 18-month-old, intact female water spaniel with thrombocytopenia that developed a massive retropharyngeal hematoma and symptoms of airway compromise. The dog required tracheal intubation followed by surgical tracheostomy. Lateral cervical radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was consistent with a retropharyngeal hematoma compromising the airway. The retropharyngeal hematoma was managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: Retropharyngeal hematoma should be considered in patients presenting with abrupt respiratory distress. Magnetic resonance imaging allowed specific diagnosis of a rare condition that is otherwise difficult to diagnose.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jakab, Csaba</author><author>Balka, Gyula</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First report of a malignant collision skin tumour with malignant melanoma and  anaplastic sarcoma components in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Hungarica</full-title></periodical><pages>245-255</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bile Duct Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Claudin-5</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Sarcoma</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22609995</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1556/AVet.2012.021</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This paper describes the occurrence of a rare skin tumour that has been removed  surgically from the upper lip of a 13-year-old Tibetan spaniel. The tumour was 0.5 cm in diameter and macroscopically appeared as a single dermal mass, but histopathological analysis identified it as a biphasic collision mixed tumour. In the anatomically uniform tumour, 70% (4 mm in diameter) of the total parenchyma was formed by a high-grade sarcoma (with the presence of giant cells), and about 30% of it (1 mm in diameter) was a malignant melanoma (again with the presence of giant cells). The histologically distinct, but anatomically uniform tumour parts were separated by a macroscopically invisible, non-neoplastic epithelial process originating from the overlying hyperplastic epidermis. The two malignant components did not infiltrate the peritumoural vessels and each other's substance. In the sarcoma part, the mitotic and apoptotic indexes were 32 and 8, respectively, whereas in the melanoma part the same parameters were 10 and 6, respectively. During the immunohistochemical investigations anti-α-SMA, anticytokeratin AE1-AE3, anti-Melan-A, anti-Ki-67 and anti-claudin-5 antibodies were applied. In conclusion, this is the first report of a primary cutaneous malignant biphasic collision mixed tumour formed by an anaplastic sarcoma with giant cells and a malignant melanoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klosterman, Emily S</author><author>Heng, Hock Gan</author><author>Freeman, Lynetta J</author><author>Childress, Michael O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transdiaphragmatic extension of a retroperitoneal lipoma into the intrathoracic  extrapleural space via the lumbocostal trigone in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>978-982</pages><volume>240</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Lipoma</keyword><keyword>Retroperitoneal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22471827</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.240.8.978</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old 12.2-kg (26.9-lb) spayed female American Cocker  Spaniel was referred for evaluation of abdominal discomfort and a suspected intra-abdominal lipoma with possible invasion into the thorax. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Physical examination revealed a tense abdomen, and the margins of a large abdominal mass could be appreciated. Abdominal imaging revealed a mass of fat opacity in the abdominal and thoracic cavities. Computed tomography with precontrast and postcontrast peritoneograms was used to determine whether the masses connected via a diaphragmatic defect. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Exploratory laparotomy revealed a retroperitoneal lipomatous mass that had focally invaded the hypaxial musculature and had extended across the dorsolateral aspect of the diaphragm via the lumbocostal trigone into the intrathoracic extrapleural space. Surgical resection required transdiaphragmatic thoracotomy. Histologic examination of excised tissue confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of a lipoma. The dog recovered from surgery with no complications and had no disease recurrence for at least 32 months after surgical resection. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The defect of the lumbocostal trigone is also called the foramen of Bochdalek in humans, and it is recognized as a common location for congenital diaphragmatic hernia. A lumbocostal trigone hernia may be considered as a differential diagnosis for bicavitary masses in dogs, particularly in the absence of a history of trauma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elliott, Joshua M</author><author>Mayhew, Philipp D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnostic challenges and treatment options of a suspected pericardial metallic  projectile foreign body in a dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)</full-title></periodical><pages>684-691</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Foreign-Body Migration</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Metals</keyword><keyword>Pericardial Effusion</keyword><keyword>Pericardium</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Washington</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>injuries</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22316263</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1476-4431.2011.00690.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of a suspected pericardial metallic projectile  foreign body in a dog with a history of trauma to the left shoulder and to review the literature regarding the management of cardiac and intracardiac foreign bodies. CASE SUMMARY: A 3-year-old male, neutered Brittany spaniel presented with a 10-day history of decreased activity and partial anorexia. Serial thoracic radiographs identified a migrating pericardial metallic projectile foreign body and an echocardiogram diagnosed pericardial effusion and abdominal ultrasound identified the presence of ascites. Concern for a possible effusive-constrictive pericarditis prompted a subphrenic pericardectomy performed via thoracoscopy. The foreign body was not recovered. Six months postsurgery, the dog remained asymptomatic. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: Considering the high rate of complications that develop in human patients where the foreign bodies are not removed, veterinarians should be aware of risks associated with long standing pericardial foreign bodies even when no clinical signs are present. Guidelines from the human literature may be considered for investigation of, and treatment options for, cardiac and intracardiac metallic projectile foreign bodies in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holland, C T</author><author>Holland, J T</author><author>Rozmanec, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unilateral facial myokymia in a dog with an intracranial meningioma.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>357-361</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electromyography</keyword><keyword>Facial Nerve Diseases</keyword><keyword>Facial Paralysis</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Histocytochemistry</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Meningeal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Meningioma</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20726972</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.2010.00598.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 23-month-old castrated male Cavalier King Charles spaniel was evaluated because  of a 6-month history of unusual rippling/undulating movements of the right facial muscles that were continuous and persisted during sleep. Neurological examination revealed narrowing of the right palpebral fissure and unilateral right-sided facial myokymia that was characterised by myokymic, and to a lesser degree, neuromyotonic discharges on concentric needle electromyographic examination. After persisting unchanged for almost 2.5 years from its onset, the facial myokymia gradually disappeared over a 6-month period concomitant with the emergence of a persistent ipsilateral facial paralysis and head tilt. At 5 years and 9 months after the first examination, signs of ipsilateral lacrimal, pharyngeal and laryngeal dysfunction became evident and the dog was euthanased. Postmortem examination identified a malignant (WHO grade III) meningioma in the right cerebellopontomedullary angle that compressed the ventrolateral cranial medulla, effaced the jugular foramen and internal acoustic meatus and extended into the facial canal of the petrous temporal bone. Novel findings were the unique observation of isolated unilateral facial myokymia preceding diagnosis of a meningioma affecting facial nerve function within the caudal cranial fossa and the remarkably long duration of neurological signs (75 months) attributable to the neoplasm.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alroy, J</author><author>Orgad, U</author><author>Ucci, A A</author><author>Schelling, S H</author><author>Schunk, K L</author><author>Warren, C D</author><author>Raghavan, S S</author><author>Kolodny, E H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neurovisceral and skeletal GM1-gangliosidosis in dogs with beta-galactosidase  deficiency.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>470-472</pages><volume>229</volume><issue>4712</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Diseases, Metabolic</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>G(M1) Ganglioside</keyword><keyword>Gangliosidoses</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lactose Intolerance</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neurons</keyword><keyword>Oligosaccharides</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Vacuoles</keyword><keyword>enzymology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year></dates><accession-num>3925555</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.3925555</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Beta-galactosidase-deficient siblings in two litters of English springer spaniel  puppies showed a progressive neurological impairment, dwarfism, orbital hypertelorism, and dysostosis multiplex.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 152 dogs evaluated for oral tumors of possible odontogenic origin at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital of the University of California-Davis between 1995 and 2005. PROCEDURES: Information was collected from records, including dog breed, age, reproductive status, and location of lesion in the oral cavity. Histologic slides pertaining to each dog were reviewed by 3 investigators. Data regarding clinicopathologic features of the 3 most common lesions (canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma [CAA], peripheral odontogenic fibroma [POF], and FFH) were summarized. RESULTS: 152 dogs with odontogenic tumors or FFH were identified. Sixty-eight (45%) dogs had CAA, 47 (31 %) had POF, 24 (16%) had FFH, and 13 (9%) had other odontogenic tumors. Canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma was present most commonly in the rostral aspect of the mandible, with POF and FFH more common in the rostral aspect of the maxilla. Males and females were equally represented among dogs with CAA and FFH. Castrated males were overrepresented among dogs with POF. Golden Retrievers, Akitas, Cocker Spaniels, and Shetland Sheepdogs were overrepresented among dogs with CAA. No breed predisposition was detected for FFH or POF. Dogs with FFH had a greater mean age at initial evaluation than did dogs with CAA or POF. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CAA, POF, and FFH have distinct clinical patterns that may help clinicians and pathologists identify such lesions more readily.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moesgaard, S G</author><author>Holte, A V</author><author>Mogensen, T</author><author>Mølbak, J</author><author>Kristensen, A T</author><author>Jensen, A L</author><author>Teerlink, T</author><author>Reynolds, A J</author><author>Olsen, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of breed, gender, exercise and white-coat effect on markers of  endothelial function in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Research in veterinary science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in veterinary science</full-title></periodical><pages>409-415</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arginine</keyword><keyword>Biomarkers</keyword><keyword>Color</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Hair</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Physical Conditioning, Animal</keyword><keyword>Sex Characteristics</keyword><keyword>analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand Factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17092526</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rvsc.2006.09.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study examines how systemic biomarkers of endothelial function and nitric  oxide metabolism are affected by exercise in dogs. Furthermore, breed variation and white-coat effect have been tested by sampling three different dog breeds both in their home and in a clinical setting. Short-term exercise increased plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx) and von Willebrand factor (vWf). There was significant difference between Pointers and the small dog breeds Cairn Terriers and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the general plasma levels of vWf and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). NOx and vWf were significantly higher when the sample was taken in the laboratory cf. at home, whereas ADMA and L-arginine were significantly lower. In conclusion, both short-term exercise and white-coat effect influence several plasma markers of endothelial function depending also on the breed and gender of the dogs. These findings should be considered in future studies concerning endothelial function in dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leppänen, M</author><author>Saloniemi, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controlling canine hip dysplasia in Finland.</title><secondary-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preventive veterinary medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>121-131</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Finland</keyword><keyword>Hip Dysplasia, Canine</keyword><keyword>Mass Screening</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10551430</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0167-5877(99)00059-8</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The aim of the study was to evaluate the Finnish Kennel Club's hip-dysplasia  screening and control programs. As a retrospective study, records of hip-dysplasia screening of 69,349 dogs in 22 breeds that were born in 1988-1995 were analyzed and compared to data from prior to 1988. In most breeds, no significant changes in dysplasia prevalence could be found. In English cocker spaniels, golden and Labrador retrievers and Rottweilers a significant decrease - but in boxers, Dobermans, German Shepherd dogs and rough collies a significant increase - in prevalence was detected. In flat-coated retrievers overall prevalence increased - but the prevalence of severe hip-dysplasia decreased significantly during the study period. The present control program has not resulted in fast progress. Selecting against hip-dysplasia cannot be expected to be very effective, when based only on mass selection on phenotypic observations. Predicted breeding values based on progeny testing would probably give better results. Also, breeders' compliance and commitment to programs is not always high and other selection criteria in breeding are thought to be more important. Modern society has high demands for animal welfare and consumer issues, and breeders and kennel societies should pay more attention to health issues in breeding pedigreed dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trivedi, Sameer R</author><author>Sykes, Jane E</author><author>Cannon, Matthew S</author><author>Wisner, Erik R</author><author>Meyer, Wieland</author><author>Sturges, Beverly K</author><author>Dickinson, Peter J</author><author>Johnson, Lynelle R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical features and epidemiology of cryptococcosis in cats and dogs in  California: 93 cases (1988-2010).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>357-369</pages><volume>239</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Cryptococcosis</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21801050</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.239.3.357</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical features of cryptococcosis among cats and dogs in  California, determine whether the distribution of involved tissues differs from distribution reported previously in a study in southeastern Australia, and identify Cryptococcus spp isolated from the study population. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 62 cats and 31 dogs with cryptococcosis. PROCEDURES: Medical records of cats and dogs with cryptococcosis were reviewed. Information collected included geographic location, species, signalment, and tissues or organs involved. Cryptococcosis was confirmed via serology, cytology, histology, or microbial culture, and molecular typing was performed. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine significant associations among variables. Other comparisons were evaluated via χ(2) or unpaired t tests. RESULTS: American Cocker Spaniels were overrepresented, compared with other dog breeds. Serum cryptococcal antigen test results were positive in 51 of 53 cats and 15 of 18 dogs tested. Cryptococcus gattii was more commonly detected in cats (7/9 for which species identification was performed), and Cryptococcus neoformans was more commonly detected in dogs (6/8). Six of 7 C gattii isolates from cats were molecular type VGIII. Distribution of involved tissues was different between cats and dogs in California and between populations of the present study and those of the previously reported Australian study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strains of Cryptococcus spp appeared to have host specificity in dogs and cats. Differences in lesion distribution between geographic locations may reflect strain differences or referral bias. Antigen assays alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis of cryptococcosis in cats and dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Minor, Katie M</author><author>Patterson, Edward E</author><author>Keating, Marguerite K</author><author>Gross, Stephanie D</author><author>Ekenstedt, Kari J</author><author>Taylor, Susan M</author><author>Mickelson, James R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presence and impact of the exercise-induced collapse associated DNM1 mutation in  Labrador retrievers and other breeds.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>214-219</pages><volume>189</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Dynamin I</keyword><keyword>Gene Frequency</keyword><keyword>Muscle Weakness</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Physical Conditioning, Animal</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21782486</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.022</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The impact of the mutation causing dynamin 1 (DNM1)-associated exercise-induced  collapse (d-EIC) was determined in a retrospective genetic survey. The frequency of DNM1 mutant allele carriers in Labrador retrievers from conformation show, field trial/hunt test, pet or service lines ranged from 17.9% to 38.0% and the frequency of homozygous mutant (EE genotype) individuals ranged from 1.8% to 13.6%; 83.6% of these EE Labradors were reported to have collapsed by 4 years of age. DNM1 mutation carriers and EE dogs with a collapse phenotype were also detected in Chesapeake Bay retrievers, Curly-coated retrievers, Boykin spaniels, Pembroke Welsh corgis and mixed breed dogs thought to be Labrador retriever crosses. The DNM1 mutation was not identified in Golden, Flat-coated, or Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers, or 15 other non-retrieving breeds. Veterinarians and breeders should be aware that the DNM1 EE genotype is not completely penetrant and that d-EIC is a widespread health concern in several very popular breeds, as well as breeds whose genetic similarity to retrievers is not obvious.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gastrointestinal foreign bodies in dogs and cats: a retrospective study of 208  cases.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>576-583</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Digestive System Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19814770</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00783.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To establish predilection sites of obstruction and to investigate  clinical factors associated with a poor outcome. METHODS: A retrospective study of 208 consecutive cases over a 48-month period from first-opinion practice. RESULTS: Overall, 91 per cent of cases recovered with higher survival rates from discrete foreign bodies (94 per cent in dogs and 100 per cent in cats) as opposed to linear foreign bodies (80 per cent in dogs and 63 per cent in cats). English bull terriers, springer spaniels, Staffordshire bull terriers, Border collies and Jack Russell terriers were over-represented. In dogs, 63 per cent of obstructions occurred in the jejunum but foreign objects were encountered at all points along the gastrointestinal tract. A longer duration of clinical signs, the presence of a linear foreign body and multiple intestinal procedures were associated with significantly increased mortality. Neither the degree of obstruction (partial or complete) nor the location of the foreign body was shown to have a significant influence on survival. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Prompt presentation, diagnosis and surgical intervention improve the outcome of gastrointestinal obstruction by foreign bodies. At surgery, the minimal number of intestinal procedures should be performed to restore the integrity of the alimentary tract.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dennis, Michelle M</author><author>Ehrhart, Nicole</author><author>Duncan, Colleen G</author><author>Barnes, Ashley B</author><author>Ehrhart, E J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Frequency of and risk factors associated with lingual lesions in dogs: 1,196  cases (1995-2004).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1533-1537</pages><volume>228</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glossitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mouth Diseases</keyword><keyword>Mouth Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16677121</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.228.10.1533</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To categorize histologic lesions affecting the tongue, determine the  frequency with which they develop, and identify risk factors associated with their development in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 1,196 dogs. PROCEDURES: Diagnostic reports of lingual biopsy specimens from dogs evaluated from January 1995 to October 2004 were reviewed. RESULTS: Neoplasia comprised 54% of lingual lesions. Malignant tumors accounted for 64% of lingual neoplasms and included melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. Large-breed dogs, especially Chow Chows and Chinese Shar-Peis, were at increased risk for melanoma. Females of all breeds and Poodles, Labrador Retrievers, and Samoyeds were more likely to have squamous cell carcinomas. Hemangiosarcomas and fibrosarcomas were commonly diagnosed in Border Collies and Golden Retrievers, respectively. Benign neoplasms included squamous papilloma, plasma cell tumor, and granular cell tumor. Small-breed dogs, especially Cocker Spaniels, were at increased risk for plasma cell tumors. Glossitis accounted for 33% of diagnoses; in most cases, the inciting cause was not apparent. Whereas large-breed dogs were more likely to have lingual neoplasia, small-breed dogs were more likely to have glossitis. Calcinosis circumscripta accounted for 4% of lingual lesions and predominately affected young large-breed dogs. The remaining submissions consisted mostly of various degenerative or wound-associated lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The frequency of lingual lesions was not evenly distributed across breeds, sexes, or size classes of dogs. Veterinarians should be aware of the commonly reported lingual lesions in dogs so that prompt diagnosis and appropriate management can be initiated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Serfass, Pierre</author><author>Chetboul, Valérie</author><author>Sampedrano, Carolina Carlos</author><author>Nicolle, Audrey</author><author>Benalloul, Thierry</author><author>Laforge, Hervé</author><author>Gau, Christophe</author><author>Hébert, Carole</author><author>Pouchelon, Jean-Louis</author><author>Tissier, Renaud</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrospective study of 942 small-sized dogs: Prevalence of left apical systolic  heart murmur and left-sided heart failure, critical effects of breed and sex.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society  of Veterinary Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>11-18</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>19083332</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvc.2005.10.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: The main goals of this study were (1) to carry out a retrospective  study of the prevalence of left apical systolic heart murmurs, which are considered to clinically reflect the presence of MVD, in the 6 small canine breeds most popular in France, i.e., Yorkshire Terrier, Bichon Maltese, Dachshund, Poodle, Lhassa Apso and Shi Tzu and (2) to compare the results with those obtained in a recent report published by our group on MVD in 451 CKC. BACKGROUND: Mitral valvular disease (MVD) has been extensively studied in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKC) but seldom studied and compared in other small-breed dogs. The first clinical sign of MVD is the early appearance of a left apical systolic heart murmur. ANIMALS: Nine hundred and forty-two adult dogs were included in the present study (mean+/-SD, age=6.5+/-4.4 years, weight=6.2+/-2.6kg). RESULTS: The average total prevalence of left apical systolic heart murmur was 14.4% compared with 40.6% in CKC. It was significantly more prevalent in males (18.5%) than in females (9.8%). Shi Tzu and Dachshunds were the most affected breeds investigated. Most (81%) of the dogs with left apical systolic murmur were classified in ISACHC heart failure class I. CONCLUSION: This large retrospective study suggests that the prevalence of MVD is higher in CKC than in the 6 small breeds investigated. Moreover, most of the dogs do not develop congestive heart failure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Capak, D</author><author>Simpraga, M</author><author>Maticić, D</author><author>Bali, R</author><author>Janoska, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence of foreign-body-induced ileus in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift</full-title></periodical><pages>290-296</pages><volume>114</volume><issue>7-8</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Croatia</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foreign Bodies</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Obstruction</keyword><keyword>Intestines</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Seasons</keyword><keyword>Sex Distribution</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11505803</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>While playing or simply because of avidity, dogs may ingest a variety of foreign  bodies. Ingested foreign bodies, which are not stopped in the mouth or oesophagus, enter into the stomach. Once a foreign body has passed through the pylorus, jejunum and ileum appear to be the most common sites of the small intestine obstruction. The records of 103 cases, treated at the Clinic for Surgery, Orthopaedics and Ophthalmology of the Veterinarian Faculty, University of Zagreb from January 1981 till December 1998 were analysed. The analysis included the incidence of ileus caused by foreign bodies and the distribution of patients by sex, age, breed, duration of illness, site of obstruction, types of foreign bodies and the interrelation between these parameters. The results of our research show that the number of patients with foreign body induced ileus is increasing. Males ingested foreign bodies more often than females. Foreign body induced ileus was more frequently found in animals below 2 years of age. Foreign bodies were mostly ingested by mongrels, but also by popular dog breeds such as Dobermanns, Poodles, Cocker Spaniels and Rottweiler. Most of these ileus cases were found in March and October and the predominant clinical signs included anorexia, dehydration, abdominal tenderness and absence of defecation. The most common site of small intestine obstruction by foreign bodies was the jejunum, and the most effective treatment was enterotomy. Dogs mostly ingested stones, plastic and rubber objects. The treatment was more successful in dogs below 2 years of age. Patients that died post-surgically, died mostly the first day after surgery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Gaag, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The histological appearance of large intestinal biopsies in dogs with clinical  signs of large bowel disease.</title><secondary-title>Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche  veterinaire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche  veterinaire</full-title></periodical><pages>75-82</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrophy</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Colitis</keyword><keyword>Colon</keyword><keyword>Colonic Diseases</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Colonoscopy</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fibrosis</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Rectum</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year></dates><accession-num>3349403</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Colonic and rectal forceps and excision biopsies of 355 dogs with clinical signs  of large bowel disease were investigated. Five percent of the forceps biopsies were unsuitable for examination; all excision biopsies were of good quality. Forceps biopsies were obtained from one to eight sites, up to 60 cm cranial from the anus, while excision biopsies, mostly from tumors, were from the rectoanal region. Slight to severe colitis and/or proctitis was found in 192 dogs (54%). A single type of colitis was seen in 160 dogs; in 53 cases the lesions were local, in 107 cases multiple. A combination of different types of colitis was found in 32 dogs. Atrophic colitis, diffuse colitis and canine histiocytic ulcerative colitis were the most prominent findings, followed by ulcerative, superficial and eosinophilic colitis. Follicular, hypertrophic and aspecific granulomatous colitis were found in only a few cases. Tumors were diagnosed in 57 dogs (16%). Of these tumors 50 were of epithelial and seven were of mesenchymal origin. A high percentage (61%) of the epithelial tumors consisted of adenomas of the rectoanal region. In ten other dogs (3%) a differential diagnosis of lymphosarcoma or colitis had to be made. Colitis and colorectal tumors were more prevalent in Boxers, German Shepherds, Poodles, Great Danes and Spaniels. In the Boxers simple chronic colitis, as well as canine histiocytic ulcerative colitis were more frequently found, the latter especially in females. Other biopsy findings were edema, crypt cysts, hemorrhages, an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and an increased or decreased number of goblet cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marmor, M</author><author>Willeberg, P</author><author>Glickman, L T</author><author>Priester, W A</author><author>Cypess, R H</author><author>Hurvitz, A I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epizootiologic patterns of diabetes mellitus in dogs.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>465-470</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Castration</keyword><keyword>Cataract</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Complications</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mammary Glands, Animal</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Seasons</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>7073062</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A case-control study of spontaneous diabetes mellitus in dogs was undertaken,  using 2 veterinary data bases. The Veterinary Medical Data Program (VMDP) contained records of 1,019 cases of canine diabetes from 14 university-affiliated veterinary hospitals. The Animal Medical Center (AMC), a private veterinary hospital which has not participated in the VMDP, contained records of 449 diabetes cases. Each data base was analyzed separately, control groups being chosen from all admissions, excluding diabetic animals. Summary odds ratios by sex adjusted for age and breed indicated significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated risks for entire females and neutered females compared with that for entire males. The VMDP data indicated a significantly elevated risk for castrated males, whereas the risk derived from AMC data was not significantly different from 1. Analysis of risks by breed adjusting for age and sex identified Poodles as being at significantly excess risk, and German Shepherd Dogs, Cocker Spaniels, Collies, and Boxers at significantly decreased risk in both data sets. The male-female risk ratio changed with age from 1 at less than 1 year of age to a predominance of females at older ages. In the AMC data base, diabetes was significantly associated with cataracts in dogs of both sexes combined. Diabetes was also significantly associated with benign mammary tumors in female dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Teixeira, Leandro B C</author><author>Pinkerton, Marie E</author><author>Dubielzig, Richard R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Periocular extracranial cutaneous meningiomas in two dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the  American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc</full-title></periodical><pages>575-579</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Meningeal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24803575</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1040638714533116</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Cutaneous meningiomas are rare tumors in human beings and animals. Two canine  cases of cutaneous meningiomas affecting the eyelid are described in the current study: the first from a 5-week-old female Springer Spaniel dog with an 8 cm in diameter congenital mass expanding the left upper eyelid and medial canthus; the second from a 10-year-old female spayed Maltese-Poodle mix dog with 3 firm subcutaneous nodules affecting the right upper eyelid. All masses were removed surgically. Histologically, tumors were composed of spindle-to-epithelioid cells arranged in small lobules forming solid concentric whorls. Neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin and S100 and negative for pancytokeratin, glial fibrillar acid protein, and neurofilament. Transmission electron microscopy revealed meningothelial cells with convoluted interdigitating processes, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes, and moderate numbers of cytoplasmic microfilaments. None of the cases presented a primary neuroaxial meningioma. The first case presents clinicopathological features consistent with human type I (congenital) cutaneous meningioma. The second case is consistent with a type II (acquired ectopic) tumor, and both are hypothesized to arise from ectopic arachnoid cells displaced during development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valentine, B A</author><author>Bildfell, R J</author><author>Cooper, B J</author><author>Giger, U</author><author>Fischer, K A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Complex polysaccharide inclusions in skeletal muscle adjacent to sarcomas in two  dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>278-280</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Amylopectin</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Femoral Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Joint Diseases</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron</keyword><keyword>Muscle, Skeletal</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Polysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Sarcoma, Synovial</keyword><keyword>Stifle</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12009068</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1354/vp.39-2-278</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Inclusions of periodic acid-Schiff-positive, amylase resistant material were  found within skeletal muscle fibers adjacent to an osteosarcoma in the proximal femur of an 8-year-old intact female Cocker Spaniel dog (dog No. 1) and adjacent to a synovial cell sarcoma of the stifle joint in a 7-year-old spayed female Bouvier des Flandres dog (dog No. 2). Inclusions were pale blue-gray with hematoxylin and eosin stain and formed irregular inclusions, replacing up to approximately 80% of the fiber diameter. Inclusions from dog No. 2 were of non-membrane-bound granular to filamentous material that occasionally formed discrete, elongate electron-dense masses. The features of these inclusions were similar to those of materials previously described as complex polysaccharide, polyglucosan bodies, amylopectin, and Lafora bodies.

Histopathological examination of mucosal pinch biopsies collected from the mass confirmed a diagnosis of adenomatous tubulopapillary polyp. Some evidence of malignant transformation was observed. Palliative treatment with piroxicam suppositories at a dose of 1.4 mg/kg administered rectally every third day was instituted. On re-evaluation, 47 days after starting medical therapy, the owner reported a significant reduction in haematochezia and tenesmus; however, frequency of defecation had remained unaltered.

Furthermore, it may help to improve treatment and prevention of urolithiasis. In this study, 7866 uroliths (44.5% feline and 55.5% canine) from veterinary practitioners in the Netherlands between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. Between 2014 and 2020 the distribution over the different types of uroliths remained similar over time. Female cats, obese cats, Domestic Shorthair cats, female dogs, and large breed dogs had an increased risk for struvite. Neutered cats, all cat breeds except Domestic Shorthair, neutered dogs, male dogs, intact male dogs, and small breed dogs had an increased risk for calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Cystine and urate were found predominantly in male dogs. Dalmatians were at highest risk for urate urolithiasis. The findings of this study in the Netherlands were similar to findings in previous studies from different countries. However, urate urolithiasis in the English Cocker Spaniel and cystine urolithiasis in the Yorkshire Terrier were new associations. Body condition score, information about recurrence of urolithiasis, medical history, and diet history should be included in submission sheets in the future to explore other possible associations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Takagi, Hidefumi</author><author>Azuma, Kazuo</author><author>Osaki, Tomohiro</author><author>Itoh, Norihiko</author><author>Nakazumi, Shinichi</author><author>Taura, Yasuho</author><author>Okamoto, Yoshiharu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High temperature hyperthermia treatment for canines exhibiting superficial  tumors: A report of three cases.</title><secondary-title>Oncology letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology letters</full-title></periodical><pages>2055-2058</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25295089</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ol.2014.2496</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>High temperature hyperthermia (HTH) treatment has previously been demonstrated to  suppress tumor growth in a tumor-bearing rat model. In the present study, the effects of HTH therapy for the treatment of spontaneous tumors in canines was evaluated. In case 1, an 18-year-old female Papillon presented with a right forelimb rhabdomyosarcoma. Case 2 was a 13-year-old male English Cocker Spaniel with a right external auditory canal ceruminous adenocarcinoma and case 3 was a 14-year-old male Golden Retriever that exhibited a perianal gland adenocarcinoma, which surrounded the anus. HTH treatment was performed in all three cases for 10 min at 45-65°C with or without the inhalation of isoflurane. In case 1, the tumor disappeared four weeks following HTH treatment. In case 2, the tumor volume had decreased by day 21, and in case 3, HTH was performed three times and the tumor disappeared following the third procedure. HTH is considered to be a simple procedure with no severe side effects. Consequently, this treatment modality is hypothesized to become a useful alternative therapy for superficial tumors in companion animals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, X</author><author>Miller, A B</author><author>Lepine, A J</author><author>Scott, J D</author><author>Murphy, K E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) for identifying genetic  markers associated with canine hip dysplasia.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>99-103</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Hip Dysplasia, Canine</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>9987913</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/90.1.99</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine hip dysplasia is a heritable developmental disease resulting, in part,  from increased laxity in hip joints and is a precursor to degenerative joint disease. Identification of genetic markers linked to joint laxity would foster development of more accurate diagnostic methods, facilitate identification of the disease gene(s), and supplement efforts to establish physical/genetic maps of the canine genome. Work presented here describes analysis of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA in the search for markers which cosegregate with increased joint laxity in Canis familiaris, the domestic dog. The Boykin spaniel, a highly inbred breed afflicted with an extremely high incidence of hip dysplasia, served as a model for study of canine hip dysplasia. Only 5% of 200 random primers revealed significant polymorphisms within this breed. However polymorphisms were detected in seemingly nonpolymorphic amplification products when digested with restriction enzymes. Restriction digestion revealed polymorphisms in 15% of the monomorphic amplification products. Among the primers that revealed polymorphisms, one primer correctly identified 9 of 12 dogs with regard to joint laxity. However, extensive evaluation is required before any assertion can be made regarding linkage of this marker to joint laxity. Of interest, another primer amplified a genomic segment unique to the canine Y chromosome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fletcher, J L</author><author>Taylor, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associations between neurologic dysfunction and lesions in canine fucosidosis.</title><secondary-title>Genes, brain, and behavior</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes, brain, and behavior</full-title></periodical><pages>420-428</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Disease Models, Animal</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fucosidosis</keyword><keyword>Nervous System Diseases</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26711085</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gbb.12282</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine fucosidosis in English Springer spaniels is the only animal model of the  neurovisceral lysosomal storage disease fucosidosis available for preclinical therapeutic trials. For this reason, it is crucial to identify critical time points in disease progression, and if there are particular lesions associated with specific aspects of neurologic dysfunction. Historical records of 53 canine fucosidosis cases from 1979 to 2009 containing a neurologic dysfunction score assessing motor, behavioral and sensory dysfunction were interrogated by statistical analysis. Motor and behavioral dysfunction scores assessing gait deficits and apprehensive behavior first significantly increased at 12-17 months, and increased at each 6-month interval thereafter. Sensory dysfunction scores, assessing hearing loss, balance and vision deterioration, did not significantly increase until 18-23 months, and coincided with a rapid decline in neurologic function. Regression analysis incorporating published neuropathology data, measured by image analysis, identified neuroinflammation and apoptotic cell death as significant informative predictors of increasing neurologic dysfunction. These findings indicate that the level of neuropathology required to induce consistent and conspicuous clinical signs in canine fucosidosis is reached by approximately 12 months of age in the absence of other disease processes. Significant association between neuroinflammation and apoptotic cell death also suggests that specifically targeting these lesions combined with enzyme replacement in future studies may reduce disease burden in fucosidosis. Overall, examining this historical clinical data to identify associations between the extent of neuropathology and degree of clinical dysfunction provides a useful reference tool for monitoring disease and evaluating therapeutic trials conducted in canine fucosidosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Contreary, Caitlin L</author><author>Outerbridge, Catherine A</author><author>Affolter, Verena K</author><author>Kass, Philip H</author><author>White, Stephen D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canine sterile nodular panniculitis: a retrospective study of 39 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary dermatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary dermatology</full-title></periodical><pages>451-8, e104-5</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Panniculitis</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26283563</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/vde.12247</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Canine sterile nodular panniculitis (SNP) is an inflammatory disease  of the panniculus that is typically managed with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments. It has been reported to be a cutaneous marker of an underlying systemic disease. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To assess the presence or absence of concurrent systemic diseases associated with canine SNP and to document breed predispositions. ANIMALS: Thirty nine dogs presented to a veterinary teaching hospital from 1990 to 2012 which met inclusion criteria. METHODS: Inclusion in this retrospective study required a diagnosis of SNP via histopathological analysis and negative special stains for infectious organisms. Breed distributions of affected dogs were compared to all other dogs examined at this hospital during the study period. Correlations between the histological pattern of panniculitis and the histological presence of dermatitis, clinical presentation of lesions, dog breed and therapeutic outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Australian shepherd dogs, Brittany spaniels, Dalmatians, Pomeranians and Chihuahuas were significantly over-represented, but correlations between inflammatory patterns of panniculitis and other histological and clinical factors were not identified. Based on the information available in medical records, 32 dogs (82.1%) had no concurrent systemic diseases identified. Four dogs had concurrent polyarthritis, which may be related to SNP through unknown mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS/CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study identified several novel breed predilections for SNP; it failed to find any clear correlations with associated systemic diseases other than polyarthritis. The histological inflammatory pattern of SNP does not predict therapeutic outcome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gill, Jennifer L</author><author>Tsai, Kate L</author><author>Krey, Christa</author><author>Noorai, Rooksana E</author><author>Vanbellinghen, Jean-François</author><author>Garosi, Laurent S</author><author>Shelton, G Diane</author><author>Clark, Leigh Anne</author><author>Harvey, Robert J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A canine BCAN microdeletion associated with episodic falling syndrome.</title><secondary-title>Neurobiology of disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neurobiology of disease</full-title></periodical><pages>130-136</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Brevican</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>Genome-Wide Association Study</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Muscle Hypertonia</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21821125</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.nbd.2011.07.014</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Episodic falling syndrome (EFS) is a canine paroxysmal hypertonicity disorder  found in Cavalier King Charles spaniels. Episodes are triggered by exercise, stress or excitement and characterized by progressive hypertonicity throughout the thoracic and pelvic limbs, resulting in a characteristic 'deer-stalking' position and/or collapse. We used a genome-wide association strategy to map the EFS locus to a 3.48 Mb critical interval on canine chromosome 7. By prioritizing candidate genes on the basis of biological plausibility, we found that a 15.7 kb deletion in BCAN, encoding the brain-specific extracellular matrix proteoglycan brevican, is associated with EFS. This represents a compelling causal mutation for EFS, since brevican has an essential role in the formation of perineuronal nets governing synapse stability and nerve conduction velocity. Mapping of the deletion breakpoint enabled the development of Multiplex PCR and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) genotyping tests that can accurately distinguish normal, carrier and affected animals. Wider testing of a larger population of CKCS dogs without a history of EFS from the USA revealed that carriers are extremely common (12.9%). The development of molecular genetic tests for the EFS microdeletion will allow the implementation of directed breeding programs aimed at minimizing the number of animals with EFS and enable confirmatory diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of affected dogs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnsen, Devin A J</author><author>Maggs, David J</author><author>Kass, Philip H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of risk factors for development of secondary glaucoma in dogs: 156  cases (1999-2004).</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1270-1274</pages><volume>229</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Glaucoma</keyword><keyword>Lens Subluxation</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phacoemulsification</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>Uveitis</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>17042730</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.229.8.1270</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To determine the immediately antecedent cause of secondary glaucoma  and the prevalence of secondary glaucoma with anterior uveitis or lens dislocation in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 156 dogs with secondary glaucoma. PROCEDURES: Cause of glaucoma was determined from records. Breed, age, sex, and neuter status of all dogs with secondary glaucoma were compared with the general hospital population. The prevalence of secondary glaucoma in dogs with a primary diagnosis of lens dislocation or anterior uveitis during the same period was determined. RESULTS: Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed in 156 of 2,257 (6.9%) dogs examined because of ophthalmic disease and was bilateral in 33 (21.2%) of those dogs. In 31 (94%) bilaterally affected dogs, the antecedent cause was the same in both eyes. Common causes of secondary glaucoma were non-surgical anterior uveitis (44.9%), anterior uveitis associated with prior phacoemulsification (15.8%), and lens dislocation (15.2%). Parson Russell Terriers, Poodles, Boston Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and Australian Cattle Dogs had diagnoses of secondary glaucoma more often than expected, compared with the reference population. Age, sex, neuter status, and laterality were not associated with secondary glaucoma. The prevalence of secondary glaucoma in dogs with lens dislocation or uveitis was 15% or 17%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Glaucoma develops secondary to many intraocular diseases, particularly uveitis and lens dislocation. Diagnosis of these diseases should prompt frequent monitoring of intraocular pressure, regardless of signalment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoppe, A</author><author>Denneberg, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cystinuria in the dog: clinical studies during 14 years of medical treatment.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>361-367</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Cystinuria</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drug Administration Schedule</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Records</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tiopronin</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11467594</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The purpose of this study was to summarize 14 years of clinical experience with  medical treatment of 88 cystinuric dogs. Of special interest was evaluation of recurrence rate of cystine uroliths and adverse effects during long-term tiopronin treatment. Twenty-six different breeds were recognized, and the most common breeds were Dachshunds, Tibetan Spaniels, and Basset Hounds. In 76 of 88 treated dogs (86%), re-formation of cystine uroliths was prevented. Recurrence rate of cystine uroliths changed from 7 months before to 18 months during tiopronin treatment. On 28 occasions, bladder stones were found, and in about 60% of the dogs, the uroliths dissolved. Quantitative measurement of the urinary excretion of cystine showed a significantly (P &lt; .03) higher excretion of cystine in dogs with recurrent urolith formation than in dogs with only 1 urolith episode. Another finding was a significant (P = .02) decrease in urinary cystine excretion in older (&gt;5 years) than in younger (&lt;5 years) dogs. Adverse effects were found in 11 dogs, and the most severe signs were aggressiveness and myopathy. All signs disappeared when tiopronin treatment was stopped. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of an individual strategy for lifelong treatment of cystinuria. In addition to increasing water intake, chemical modification of the cysteine molecule into a more soluble form by means of tiopronin is useful. In dogs with re-formed cystine uroliths, dissolution may be induced by increasing the tiopronin dosage to 40 mg/kg body weight per day. In dogs with a low urolith recurrence rate and low urinary cystine excretion, the tiopronin dosage may be decreased or treatment discontinued.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, T D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diet and skin disease in dogs and cats.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of nutrition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of nutrition</full-title></periodical><pages>2783S-2789S</pages><volume>128</volume><issue>12 Suppl</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cat Diseases</keyword><keyword>Cats</keyword><keyword>Diet</keyword><keyword>Dietary Proteins</keyword><keyword>Dietary Supplements</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatty Acids, Essential</keyword><keyword>Skin Diseases</keyword><keyword>Vitamins</keyword><keyword>administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9868266</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jn/128.12.2783S</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Dietary factors have a major role in the maintenance of healthy coat and skin,  and are significant in the etiology and therapy of certain skin diseases. Nutritional deficiencies are now uncommon as a result of the widespread feeding of complete and balanced pet foods. Deficiencies of (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids, zinc and vitamins, however, do arise in certain animal- or product-related instances. Supraphysiologic doses of vitamin A have been used in the management of vitamin A-responsive dermatosis in Cocker spaniels; other keratinization defects and seborrheic conditions may respond to retinoid therapy. Much interest has been paid to the therapeutic value of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements in the management of dermatologic conditions associated with hypersensitivity reactions or keratinization defects. These studies have generally yielded disappointing results, which may reflect shortcomings in the design of some trials. Nevertheless, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study has demonstrated a clear benefit of high dose (n-3) fatty acids in the management of pruritic skin disease. There is also preliminary experimental evidence that specific dietary (n-6):(n-3) fatty ratios are useful in the dietary management of inflammatory diseases. Although results of controlled clinical trials are awaited, the argument exists that it is the absolute amount of (n-3) fatty acid intake rather than ratio that is responsible for potential health benefits.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, H D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of mild mitral valve insufficiency, sodium intake, and place of blood  sampling on the renin-angiotensin system in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta veterinaria Scandinavica</full-title></periodical><pages>109-118</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aldosterone</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Diet, Sodium-Restricted</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Renin</keyword><keyword>Renin-Angiotensin System</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><accession-num>8659339</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/BF03548123</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>In 23 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, 12 with mild mitral valve insufficiency  (MVI) and 11 controls, the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was assessed by measuring the plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in 5 different settings. The dogs were sampled at the clinic before the trial and thereafter at home and at the clinic; during both a period on control diet and a period on low sodium diet. The dogs with mild MVI had the highest median PRA and PAC in all 5 settings. An analysis of variance accordingly showed that dogs with mild MVI had significantly higher PRA (p &lt; 0.0001) and PAC (p = 0.03) than controls, and that the sodium intake and place of blood sampling did not significantly affect this finding. The sodium intake had highly significant effects on PRA and PAC, and the place of blood sampling had no significant effects on PRA and PAC. The activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum was lower in dogs with mild MVI than in controls (p = 0.0002). The plasma levels of endothelin-1, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin, 3 peptides of pathophysiologic importance in congestive heart failure, were not significantly changed by the disease. The early activation of the RAS in dogs with MVI suggests that the valvular disease process itself might be the cause of the activation, but confirmation of this requires further studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Höglund, K</author><author>Hanås, S</author><author>Carnabuci, C</author><author>Ljungvall, I</author><author>Tidholm, A</author><author>Häggström, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blood pressure, heart rate, and urinary catecholamines in healthy dogs subjected  to different clinical settings.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1300-1308</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Husbandry</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Pressure</keyword><keyword>Catecholamines</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart Rate</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypertension</keyword><keyword>Ownership</keyword><keyword>Stress, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Veterinarians</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>urine</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22998326</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-1676.2012.00999.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Correct interpretation of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR)  recordings is important in a clinical environment, but little is known about effects of stress on BP and HR responses of dogs to different clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate BP and HR responses in different clinical settings in dogs of 3 breeds, and to relate findings to urinary catecholamine concentrations measured by ELISA assays previously validated for use in human plasma and urine, after validation for use in dogs. ANIMALS: Client-owned healthy dogs; 41 Labrador Retrievers, 33 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), and 15 Dachshunds. METHODS: Prospective observational study. BP and HR were measured in 4 clinical settings with or without veterinarian and owner present. Urine samples were taken before and after examination. ELISA assays were validated for canine urine, and epinephrine/creatinine and norepinephrine/creatinine ratios were analyzed. RESULTS: BP and HR were higher when measured by veterinarian alone than when owner was present (P &lt; .020). Urinary catecholamine/creatinine ratios were higher after examination, compared with before, in all dogs (P &lt; .0001). Labrador Retrievers had lower diastolic BP than Dachshunds in 2 settings (P ≤ .041), lower HR than CKCSs in 3 settings (all P &lt; .0001), and lower catecholamine/creatinine ratios after examination than both other breeds (P ≤ .035). The in-house validation showed mean spiked recovery of 96.5% for epinephrine and 83.8% for norepinephrine. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: BP and HR responses were related to breed as well as clinical setting. Breed differences were detected in urinary catecholamine/creatinine ratios. Further studies on breed differences are warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarnow, Inge</author><author>Olsen, Lisbeth H</author><author>Kvart, Clarence</author><author>Hoglund, Katja</author><author>Moesgaard, Sophia G</author><author>Kamstrup, Thea S</author><author>Pedersen, Henrik D</author><author>Häggström, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictive value of natriuretic peptides in dogs with mitral valve disease.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>195-201</pages><volume>180</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atrial Natriuretic Factor</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Natriuretic Peptide, Brain</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>18675567</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.12.026</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Natriuretic peptides are useful in diagnosing heart failure in dogs. However,  their usefulness in detecting early stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) has been debated. This study evaluated N-terminal (NT) fragment pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in 39 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with pre-clinical mitral valve regurgitation (MR), sixteen dogs with clinical signs of heart failure (HF) and thirteen healthy control dogs. Twenty seven CKCS and ten control dogs were re-examined 4 years after the initial examination and the status of the dogs 5 years after the initial examination was determined by telephone calls to the owner. All dogs were evaluated by clinical examination and echocardiography. CKCS with severe MR had higher NT-proANP and NT-proBNP compared to controls and CKCS with less severe MR. Dogs with clinical signs of HF had markedly elevated NT-proANP and NT-proBNP. Plasma concentrations of the natriuretic peptides measured at re-examination could predict progression in regurgitant jet size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Batchelor, Daniel J</author><author>Noble, Peter-John M</author><author>Cripps, Peter J</author><author>Taylor, Rebecca H</author><author>McLean, Lynn</author><author>Leibl, Marion A</author><author>German, Alexander J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breed associations for canine exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>207-214</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Sex Characteristics</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17427378</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1892/0891-6640(2007)21[207:bafcep]2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Knowledge of breed associations is valuable to clinicians and  researchers investigating diseases with a genetic basis. HYPOTHESIS: Among symptomatic dogs tested for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) by canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI) assay, EPI is common in certain breeds and rare in others. Some breeds may be overrepresented or underrepresented in the population of dogs with EPI. Pathogenesis of EPI may be different among breeds. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs with clinical signs, tested for EPI by radioimmunoassay of serum cTLI, were used. METHODS: In this retrospective study, results of 13,069 cTLI assays were reviewed. RESULTS: An association with EPI was found in Chows, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), Rough-Coated Collies (RCC), and German Shepherd Dogs (GSD) (all P &lt; .001). Chows (median, 16 months) were younger at diagnosis than CKCS (median, 72 months, P &lt; .001), but not significantly different from GSD (median, 36 months, P = .10) or RCC (median, 36 months, P = .16). GSD (P &lt; .001) and RCC (P = .015) were younger at diagnosis than CKCS. Boxers (P &lt; .001), Golden Retrievers (P &lt; .001), Labrador Retrievers (P &lt; .001), Rottweilers (P = .022), and Weimaraners (P = .002) were underrepresented in the population with EPI. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An association with EPI in Chows has not previously been reported. In breeds with early-onset EPI, immune-mediated mechanisms are possible or the disease may be congenital. When EPI manifests later, as in CKCS, pathogenesis is likely different (eg, secondary to chronic pancreatitis). Underrepresentation of certain breeds among dogs with EPI has not previously been recognized and may imply the existence of breed-specific mechanisms that protect pancreatic tissue from injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chapman, P S</author><author>Boag, A K</author><author>Guitian, J</author><author>Boswood, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in 23 dogs (1999-2002).</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>435-440</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Angiostrongylus</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Feces</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Strongylida Infections</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>parasitology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15460201</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2004.tb00261.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Angiostrongylosis was diagnosed in 23 dogs presenting to the Queen Mother  Hospital for Animals between June 1999 and August 2002. The animals' clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and certain risk factors were compared with a control population of 3407 dogs. Twenty-two of the 23 dogs were from south-east England and dogs from Surrey (n=8) were significantly overrepresented. There were also significantly more Cavalier King Charles spaniels (n=5) and Staffordshire bull terriers (n=5) among the affected dogs than in the control group. The median age of affected dogs was 10 months (range five to 90 months). The most common presenting signs were cough (65 per cent), dyspnoea (43 per cent), haemorrhagic diathesis (35 per cent) and collapse (26 per cent). Four dogs were thrombocytopenic and eight had significant prolongations in prothrombin time and/or activated partial thromboplastin time. Thoracic radiographs were abnormal in 18 of 19 dogs. A variety of changes were observed, the most typical being a patchy alveolar-interstitial pattern affecting the dorsocaudal lung fields. Angiostrongylus vasorum larvae were found in seven of 10 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens and 19 of 19 faecal samples. Three dogs died shortly after admission to the hospital. The remainder were successfully treated with fenbendazole at a dose of 50 mg/kg for five to 21 days. A vasorum should now be considered endemic to south-east England.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, H D</author><author>Häggström, J</author><author>Falk, T</author><author>Mow, T</author><author>Olsen, L H</author><author>Iversen, L</author><author>Jensen, A L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Auscultation in mild mitral regurgitation in dogs: observer variation, effects of  physical maneuvers, and agreement with color Doppler echocardiography and phonocardiography.</title><secondary-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of veterinary internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>56-64</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography, Doppler, Color</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Auscultation</keyword><keyword>Heart Murmurs</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve</keyword><keyword>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Observer Variation</keyword><keyword>Phonocardiography</keyword><keyword>Running</keyword><keyword>Veterinarians</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10052065</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Observer variation in diagnosing mild mitral regurgitation in dogs by cardiac  auscultation was assessed by having 6 veterinarians with different levels of experience examine 57 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Comparisons with color Doppler echocardiography and phonocardiography were made, and the effects of 2 physical maneuvers on the auscultatory findings were evaluated. Using mildly diseased dogs, interobserver agreement in diagnosing the presence or absence of left-sided murmurs ranged from 63% to 88%. The agreement with phonocardiography (range, 53-91%) increased with the amount of observer experience. The 2 most experienced observers could discern soft ejection murmurs from regurgitant murmurs and were able to diagnose 89% of the dogs with regurgitant jets larger than 30% of the left atrial area. In general, less experienced observers diagnosed most jets larger than 50%. In many dogs with small jets, no murmur was found by auscultation and phonocardiography. The audibility of mild regurgitation was significantly reduced in dogs that were difficult to auscultate. Early systolic murmurs were typical of mild regurgitation, whereas holosystolic murmurs typified severe regurgitation. In a few dogs, late systolic murmurs alternated with holosystolic murmurs. Systolic clicks were found phonocardiographically in 18 dogs with mild to moderate regurgitation, but the audibility apparently was low. In many mildly affected dogs, physical maneuvers increased murmur intensity. Thus, some form of dynamic auscultation might facilitate the diagnosis of mild regurgitation. Auscultatory findings in mild regurgitation appear to depend on observer experience, circulatory status, and how difficult the dog is to auscultate.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Finco, D R</author><author>Brown, S A</author><author>Crowell, W A</author><author>Brown, C A</author><author>Barsanti, J A</author><author>Carey, D P</author><author>Hirakawa, D A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of aging and dietary protein intake on uninephrectomized geriatric dogs.</title><secondary-title>American journal of veterinary research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of veterinary research</full-title></periodical><pages>1282-1290</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Body Weight</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Dietary Proteins</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fibrosis</keyword><keyword>Glomerular Filtration Rate</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney Function Tests</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Nephrectomy</keyword><keyword>Proteins</keyword><keyword>analysis</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>7802397</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Thirty-one clinically normal Cocker Spaniels, Miniature Schnauzers, and Doberman  Pinschers (28 female, 3 male) 7 to 8 years old were uninephrectomized (month -2) to increase the risk of renal damage associated with reduction of renal mass. Two diets, differing principally in protein concentration, were used to test the hypothesis that high dietary protein intake causes renal damage in aging dogs. For 2 months after uninephrectomy, all dogs were fed diet A (18% protein). After glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured (month 0), 16 dogs were assigned to group A and were fed diet A for an additional 48 months. The other 15 dogs were assigned to group B, and were fed diet B (34% protein) for the subsequent 48 months. At 6-month intervals, GFR and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UP/C) were determined. At 48 months, terminal studies were done, survivors were euthanatized, and tissues were examined. Of 16 dogs in group A, 10 survived, compared with 13 of 15 in group B. Among survivors, a significant difference in GFR was not found between groups A and B, and decrease in GFR was not evident with time in either group. At 48 months, oral administration of casein caused minor acute effects on GFR and renal plasma flow in dogs of groups A and B. The UP/C values increased significantly (P = 0.001) from baseline values, but the increase was not progressive. The UP/C values were not affected by diet. Some dogs in both groups developed UP/C &gt; 1.0.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wright, J C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Severe attacks by dogs: characteristics of the dogs, the victims, and the attack  settings.</title><secondary-title>Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)</full-title></periodical><pages>55-61</pages><volume>100</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bites and Stings</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>South Carolina</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year></dates><accession-num>3918325</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Sixteen incidents involving dog bites fitting the description &quot;severe&quot; were  identified among 5,711 dog bite incidents reported to health departments in five South Carolina counties (population 750,912 in 1980) between July 1, 1979, and June 30, 1982. A &quot;severe&quot; attack was defined as one in which the dog &quot;repeatedly bit or vigorously shook its victim, and the victim or the person intervening had extreme difficulty terminating the attack.&quot; Information from health department records was clarified by interviews with animal control officers, health and police officials, and persons with firsthand knowledge of the events. Investigation disclosed that the dogs involved in the 16 severe attacks were reproductively intact males. The median age of the dogs was 3 years. A majority of the attacks were by American Staffordshire terriers, St. Bernards, and cocker spaniels. Ten of the dogs had been aggressive toward people or other dogs before the incident that was investigated. Ten of the 16 victims of severe attacks were 10 years of age or younger; the median age of all 16 victims was 8 years. Twelve of the victims either were members of the family that owned the attacking dog or had had contact with the dog before the attack. Eleven of the victims were bitten on the head, neck, or shoulders. In 88 percent of the cases, the attacks took place in the owner's yard or home, or in the adjoining yard. In 10 of the 16 incidents, members of the victims' families witnessed the attacks. The characteristics of these attacks, only one of which proved fatal, were similar in many respects to those that have been reported for other dog bite incidents that resulted in fatalities. On the basis of this study, the author estimates that a risk of 2 fatalities per 1,000 reported dog bites may exist nationwide. Suggestions made for the prevention of severe attacks focus on changing the behavior of both potential canine attackers and potential victims.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corson, S A</author><author>Corson, E O</author><author>Andrysco, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cardiac and respiratory orienting reflexes as indices of susceptibility to  psychosomatic cardio-respiratory disorders.</title><secondary-title>Activitas nervosa superior</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Activitas nervosa superior</full-title></periodical><pages>351-372</pages><volume>Suppl 3</volume><issue>Pt 2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular Diseases</keyword><keyword>Conditioning, Psychological</keyword><keyword>Disease Susceptibility</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Orientation</keyword><keyword>Psychophysiologic Disorders</keyword><keyword>Reflex</keyword><keyword>Respiration</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>psychology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1982</year></dates><accession-num>6892141</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>We previously described stable constitutional differences in psychophysiologic  reactions of dogs exposed repeatedly to psychologically stressful situations induced by Pavlovian conditioning techniques with electrocutaneous reinforcement. Some dogs (e.g., most beagles and other hounds, and some mongrels) showed high psychophysiologic adaptation (HA dogs). Other dogs (e.g., many wirehair fox terriers, border collies, German shepherds, cocker spaniels, and some mongrels) developed persistent, almost inextinguishable psychophysiologic reactions to the entire Pavlovian aversive room complex: tachycardia, polypnea, profuse salivation, vasopressin release, high energy metabolism, and high urinary catecholamines (low adaptation or LA dogs). Analysis of the development and extinction of cardiac and respiratory orienting reflexes (O.R.) in these two types of dogs indicates that the LA dogs exhibit higher frequency and more intensive, persistent, and highly fluctuating (poorly modulated) cardiac and respiratory O.R.s than those exhibited by the HA dogs, which show rapid O.R. habituation and good modulation. Insofar as one may extrapolate these data to human subjects, recording of the dynamics of the development and habituation and the degree of modulation of visceral orienting reflexes may facilitate the early detection of individuals at risk for cardio-respiratory and other psychovisceral disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterson, Marisa R</author><author>Porter, Brian F</author><author>Edwards, Erin E</author><author>Piccione, Julie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subcutaneous Implantation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Dog.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>51-54</pages><volume>199</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Hepatocellular</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Iatrogenic Disease</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>36283286</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2022.09.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A 13-year-old male neutered Cocker Spaniel mixed-breed dog developed a  subcutaneous mass 2 years after undergoing surgery to remove a hepatocellular carcinoma. An approximately 4 × 3 cm subcutaneous mass was found on the ventral abdomen at the cranial end of the abdominal incision from the previous surgery. The subcutaneous mass was surgically removed and histopathological examination determined that it was an implantation of the previously excised hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical labelling with hepatocyte paraffin 1 antibody and pancytokeratin. Based on the location of the subcutaneous mass at the cranial end of the abdominal incision associated with the previous hepatocellular carcinoma resection, it is likely there was iatrogenic metastasis from the primary tumour excision. Subcutaneous iatrogenic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma is well recognized in humans but has apparently never been reported in dogs.

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed 97% as CD3 positive, confirming a T-cell lineage. Additionally, T-cell subset assessment showed 53.2% to be double-negative T-lymphocytes, expressing neither CD4 nor CD8 surface markers. The number of double-negative lymphocytes in circulation coincided with the number of T-cell receptor (TCR) γδ-expressing T-cells in circulation. Molecular T-cell clonality analysis of TCR Gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangement showed a polyclonal expansion of T-lymphocytes. Histopathology confirmed the mass to be a thymoma, supporting the diagnosis of thymoma-associated T-cell lymphocytosis. Resolution of the lymphocytosis after removal of the thymoma provided further evidence for this diagnosis. To the authors' knowledge, this case is only the second report of thymoma-associated peripheral lymphocytosis in the veterinary literature, and is the first to report a confirmed thymoma-associated peripheral γδ T-cell lymphocytosis in a dog.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seelig, Davis M</author><author>Perry, James A</author><author>Avery, Anne C</author><author>Avery, Paul R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monoclonal gammopathy without hyperglobulinemia in 2 dogs with IgA secretory  neoplasms.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary clinical pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>447-453</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Fatal Outcome</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulin A, Secretory</keyword><keyword>Lymphoma, B-Cell</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Multiple Myeloma</keyword><keyword>Paraproteinemias</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20969607</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1939-165X.2010.00262.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Two dogs, an 8.5-year-old intact male Golden Retriever and a 10-year-old spayed  female English Springer Spaniel, each with varied clinical histories, were referred to the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of hypercalcemia and severe anemia, respectively. In each dog, serum total protein and globulin concentrations were within reference intervals. Cytologic examination of bone marrow aspirates from both dogs revealed moderate to marked numbers of atypical lymphoid cells with plasma cell features. Using serum immunofixation and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) quantification, a monoclonal Ig protein was identified. In conjunction with other clinicopathologic and molecular findings, IgA secretory neoplasms, B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytoid features and multiple myeloma (MM), were diagnosed. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first descriptions of IgA-secreting neoplasms in dogs that lacked hyperglobulinemia. In cases of suspected B-cell lymphoma or MM in dogs, serum proteins should be fully evaluated for the presence of a monoclonal Ig even in dogs that lack characteristic hyperproteinemia or hyperglobulinemia. This evaluation will aid in the diagnosis of secretory B-cell lymphoma or MM leading to appropriate clinical and therapeutic case management.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, R B</author><author>Crews, L</author><author>Saveraid, T</author><author>Conzemius, M G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in the limb opposite  humeral condylar fracture: 14 dogs.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T</full-title></periodical><pages>168-172</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forelimb</keyword><keyword>Humeral Fractures</keyword><keyword>Joint Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20422122</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3415/VCOT-09-08-0082</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of  incomplete ossification of the contralateral humeral condyle (IOHC) in mature dogs with unilateral, atraumatic humeral condylar fracture (HCF), and to determine the sensitivity of radiographs as a diagnostic tool for IOHC. METHODS: Computed tomography and radiographs were obtained for both elbows of 14 dogs with unilateral HCF. The images were evaluated by two boarded radiologists and the prevalence of IOHC in the limb contralateral to the HCF was identified. Sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic diagnosis of IOHC were determined. RESULTS: Incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle was present in six of 14 dogs, however IOHC was incomplete in three of the six affected dogs. Plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 0.83 (CI 95%: 0.36 to 0.99) and specificity of 1 (CI 95%: 0.60 to1). The Kappa coefficient between radiologists for radiographic examination was 0.714. Of the Spaniel breeds, four out of eight had IOHC in the limb contralateral to the HCF. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Computed tomography evaluation is more sensitive than radiographs for diagnosis of IOHC, particularly when assessing partial or incomplete IOHC. However, sensitivity of radiographic diagnosis is good and should be adequate in most cases. Clinical suspicion of IOHC in the contralateral limb to the unilateral HCF should be present; however overall frequency may not be as high as previously reported.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pujar, S</author><author>Kothapalli, K S D</author><author>Göring, H H H</author><author>Meyers-Wallen, V N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linkage to CFA29 detected in a genome-wide linkage screen of a canine pedigree  segregating Sry-negative XX sex reversal.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>438-444</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Mapping</keyword><keyword>Disorders of Sex Development</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Genetic Markers</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>X Chromosome</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17591608</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jhered/esm028</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Canine Sry-negative XX sex reversal is a disorder of gonadal development wherein  individuals having a female karyotype develop testes or ovotestes. In this study, linkage mapping was undertaken in a pedigree derived from one proven carrier American cocker spaniel founder male and beagle females. All affected dogs in the analysis were XX true hermaphrodites and confirmed to be Sry negative by polymerase chain reaction. A genome-wide linkage screen conducted using 245 microsatellite markers revealed highest LOD score of 3.4 (marker CPH9) on CFA29. Fine mapping with additional microsatellites in the region containing CPH9 localized the Sry-negative XX sex reversal locus to a 5.4-Mb candidate region between markers CPH9 and FH3003 (LOD score 3.15). Insignificant LOD scores were found at genome-wide screen or fine mapping markers that were within 10 Mb of 45 potential candidate genes reported to have a role in mammalian sex determination or differentiation. Together, these results suggest that a novel locus on CFA29 may be responsible for sex reversal in this pedigree.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, Anne C</author><author>Fine, Deborah M</author><author>Spier, Alan W</author><author>Eyster, George E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Septicemia in a young dog following treatment of patent ductus arteriosus via  coil occlusion.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1901-1904</pages><volume>228</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Foreign-Body Migration</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword><keyword>Sepsis</keyword><keyword>Stents</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>complications</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>etiology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16784381</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2460/javma.228.12.1901</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>CASE DESCRIPTION-A 12-week-old female English Springer Spaniel was evaluated for  lethargy, vomiting, and pyrexia 1 week after treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) via coil occlusion. CLINICAL FINDINGS-Test results were consistent with septicemia, and the assumption was made that the PDA occlusion coils were infected. Radiography revealed partial migration of the coil mass into the pulmonary artery and signs of congestive heart failure. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME-After successful treatment of the septicemia and heart failure, surgical removal of the coils and resection of the PDA were undertaken. Although the coil that embolized to the pulmonary vasculature was left in place, the dog's clinical signs resolved. CLINICAL RELEVANCE-This case highlights the fact that as PDA coil occlusion devices become more widely used in dogs, practitioners must be prepared to treat implant infections aggressively, with both medical and surgical interventions if necessary.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strain, George M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deafness prevalence and pigmentation and gender associations in dog breeds at  risk.</title><secondary-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)</full-title></periodical><pages>23-32</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breeding</keyword><keyword>Deafness</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem</keyword><keyword>Eye Color</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hair Color</keyword><keyword>Hearing Loss, Sensorineural</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Pigmentation</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Factors</keyword><keyword>congenital</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>14623147</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s1090-0233(03)00104-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Hearing function was tested in dogs from breeds at risk for pigment-associated  congenital sensorineural deafness - Dalmatian, English setter (ES), English cocker spaniel (ECS), bull terrier (BT), Australian cattle dog (ACD), whippet, Catahoula leopard dog, and Jack Russell terrier.

Eleven of the dogs were boxers and the other breeds affected were a Pharaoh hound, rottweiler, springer spaniel and a greyhound. The condition was bilateral in three cases. Eleven dogs were treated surgically by cast immobilisation (four cases), fragment removal (one case), lag screw fixation (three cases), pan-carpal arthrodesis (one case) and lag screw reduction followed by pan-carpal arthrodesis (two cases). The remaining four dogs were treated conservatively with rest and tactical use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Follow-up periods ranged from two months to 11 years. Varying degrees of lameness, which tended to be exacerbated by exercise, persisted in all cases. The radial carpal bone appears to have at least three separate centres of ossification which eventually fuse; their planes of fusion correspond approximately to the two main fracture lines. These areas of fusion could be weak points within the radial carpal bone.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunt, G B</author><author>Pearson, M R</author><author>Bellenger, C R</author><author>Malik, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ventricular septal defect repair in a small dog using cross-circulation.</title><secondary-title>Australian veterinary journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian veterinary journal</full-title></periodical><pages>379-382</pages><volume>72</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cardiopulmonary Bypass</keyword><keyword>Cross Circulation</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Echocardiography</keyword><keyword>Heart</keyword><keyword>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</keyword><keyword>Hemodynamics</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>abnormalities</keyword><keyword>diagnostic  imaging</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>physiology</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8599570</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-0813.1995.tb06175.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>A haemodynamically significant ventricular septal defect was diagnosed in a  3-month-old male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The present study is a comprehensive, up-to-date statistical investigation on the type, frequency and breed distribution of neoplasia in dogs in Germany. The histopathological datasets of 109,616 German canine tissue samples (2014-2019) were processed and statistically examined in retrospect. Non-neoplastic diseases were found in 38,650 samples (35.3%) and 70,966 neoplasms (64.7%) were diagnosed. The most common neoplasms were mammary tumours (21.9%), benign epithelial skin tumours (15.4%), mast cell tumour (9.7%), histiocytoma (7.0%), soft tissue sarcoma (5.8%), lipoma (5.8%), melanocytic tumours (5.2%) and odontogenic tumours (4.7%). In general, Beagles, Magyar Vizslas, Boxers, Schnauzers, Spaniels, French Bulldogs and Golden Retrievers had an increased risk of neoplasia (odds ratio 1.17-1.46; all: P ≤0.001) compared with crossbreed dogs. In particular, Boxers, Golden Retrievers, Rottweilers and Schnauzers were often affected by malignant neoplasms, whereas some breeds (eg, West Highland White Terrier, Magyar Vizsla, Chihuahua, Dachshund and Yorkshire Terrier) were frequently affected by numerous benign tumour types. Despite the known risk of haemangiosarcoma in German Shepherd Dogs, other malignant tumours were rare in this breed. Depending on the type of tumour, some purebred dog breeds can have an increased, reduced or identical risk for certain neoplasms compared with crossbreeds. Discussion of breed predispositions to tumour diseases must therefore be conducted critically and with a view to clinical relevance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adin, D B</author><author>Atkins, C E</author><author>Friedenberg, S G</author><author>Stern, J A</author><author>Meurs, K M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence of an angiotensin-converting enzyme gene variant in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Canine medicine and genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canine medicine and genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>6</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34256860</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40575-021-00105-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Genetic heterogeneity of the canine angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE) gene is functionally important because the degree of aldosterone breakthrough with ACE-inhibitor therapy is greater in variant positive dogs compared to variant negative dogs, but the prevalence of the variant is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine ACE gene variant-positive prevalence in a population of 497 dogs of different breeds. RESULTS: Overall variant-positive prevalence was 31%, with 20% of dogs heterozygous and 11% of dogs homozygous. The variant was overrepresented in Irish Wolfhounds (prevalence 95%; P &lt; .001), Dachshunds (prevalence 90%; P &lt; .001), Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (prevalence 85%; P &lt; .001), Great Danes (prevalence 84%; P &lt; .001), and Bull Mastiffs (prevalence 58%; P = .02). Irish Wolfhounds were more likely to be homozygous than heterozygous (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-third of dogs in this study were positive for a functionally important ACE gene variant, with wide prevalence variability between breeds. The clinical importance of high ACE gene variant-positive prevalence in some breeds requires further study because the highest prevalences were found in breeds that are predisposed to heart disease and therefore may be treated with ACE-inhibitors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nemec, A</author><author>Murphy, B</author><author>Kass, P H</author><author>Verstraete, F J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histological subtypes of oral non-tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma in dogs.</title><secondary-title>Journal of comparative pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of comparative pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>111-120</pages><volume>147</volume><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis, Differential</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mouth Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Oropharyngeal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Ovariectomy</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Tonsillar Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22300705</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.11.198</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Several histological subtypes and grades of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)  are described in human literature and these subtypes have distinct morphological features and biological behaviour. This retrospective study (1990-2010) included 84 dogs diagnosed with SCC of the oral cavity and oropharynx, excluding the tonsils. Sixty-nine of the SCCs (82.1%) were further diagnosed as conventional SCC (CSCC) (33 [47.8%] well-differentiated, 31 [44.9%] moderately-differentiated and five [7.3%] poorly-differentiated), five (5.95%) each as papillary SCC and basaloid SCC, three (3.6%) as adenosquamous carcinoma and two (2.4%) as spindle cell carcinoma. Compared with the general hospital population, neutered female dogs, dogs aged 10 to &lt;15 years, English springer spaniels and Shetland sheepdogs were overrepresented. The majority (78.1%) of SCCs were proliferative with or without associated ulceration, although no significant association was observed between the gross appearance and different SCC subtypes. 71.4% of SCCs were located in dentate jaws; however, well-differentiated CSCC more often affected the tongue and other non-dentate mucosal surfaces (P=0.0022). No significant association was found between any of the SCC subtypes and tumour-associated inflammation (TAI), perineural and lymphovascular invasion (PNI, LVI), or between gross appearance of the tumour and tumour location, PNI, LVI or TAI or PNI, LVI, TAI and tumour location.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl" path="mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl">mendeley_export_pubmed_spaniels.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, M S</author><author>Martin, M W S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Successful medical treatment of 15 dogs with pyothorax.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of small animal practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of small animal practice</full-title></periodical><pages>12-16</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Ampicillin</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Dog Diseases</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Drainage</keyword><keyword>Empyema, Pleural</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Metronidazole</keyword><keyword>Pedigree</keyword><keyword>Pleural Effusion</keyword><keyword>Radiography, Thoracic</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Therapeutic Irrigation</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>diagnostic imaging</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>veterinary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17212743</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1748-5827.2006.00235.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To review the success of non-surgical management, which included  antibiotics and a single thoracocentesis, in 15 dogs presenting with pyothorax. METHODS: Sixteen dogs were selected retrospectively from case files at the Veterinary Cardiorespiratory Centre. RESULTS: One dog was diagnosed with a mass suspected to be a pulmonary abscess on ultrasound examination and was referred for surgery. Fifteen dogs were treated medically. Springer spaniels were the most commonly presented breed (six cases) followed by Labrador retrievers (three cases). Under sedation or general anaesthesia, thoracocentesis was performed unilaterally and as much purulent effusion as possible was removed. Lavage of the thorax was not undertaken. In most dogs, antibiotic treatment was ampicillin at a mean dose of 33 mg/kg administered three times daily and 25 mg/kg metronidazole administered twice daily. Antibiotics were provided for a minimum of six weeks. All dogs recovered completely and did not show relapse on prolonged follow-up. This included one dog, which had very widespread pleural adhesions and minimal effusion.

HYPOTHESIS: The risk of cardiac death is higher in certain breeds and mortality varies by age and sex. DOGS: Dogs that were life insured by an animal insurance company between 1995 and 2002. METHODS: The mortality pattern for heart disease in insured dogs up to 10 years of age was studied. The influences of sex, age, breed, month, and geographic location were investigated by means of incidence rates, proportions, and survival proportions. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model time to heart disease. RESULTS: 405,376 dogs contributed to a denominator of 1,431,933 dog-years at risk (DYAR) and 3,049 dogs had been assigned a cardiac-related diagnosis as cause of death. The cardiac-related mortality for dogs &lt;10 years of age, was 21.3 deaths per 10,000 DYAR. This mortality in males and females was 27.3 deaths and 15.4 deaths per 10,000 DYAR, respectively. Twelve of 54 breeds had a point estimate above the overall rate. The 3 breeds with the highest point estimates were: Irish Wolfhounds, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Great Danes (rates of 356, 247, and 179 deaths per 10,000 DYAR, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Breed, age, and sex affect cardiac mortality in certain breeds of dogs, but no effects of month and geographic location were identified. These findings can assist clinicians in establishing diagnoses, and can assist breeders in defining priorities for preventative measures.</abstract></record></records></xml>
