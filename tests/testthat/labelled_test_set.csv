"Adeli K.Lewis G. F.","Intestinal lipoprotein overproduction in insulin-resistant states",2008,"Curr Opin Lipidol","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Excessive postprandial lipemia is highly prevalent in obese and insulin-resistant/type 2 diabetic individuals and substantially increases the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. This article will review our current understanding of the link between insulin resistance and intestinal lipoprotein overproduction and highlight some of the key recent findings in the field. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging evidence from several animal models of insulin resistance as well as insulin-resistant humans clearly supports the link between insulin resistance and aberrant intestinal lipoprotein metabolism. In insulin-resistant states elevated free fatty acid flux into the intestine downregulation of intestinal insulin signaling and upregulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein all appear to stimulate intestinal lipoprotein production. Gut peptides GLP-1 and GLP-2 may be important regulators of intestinal lipid absorption and lipoprotein production. SUMMARY: Available evidence in humans and animal models strongly favors the concept that the small intestine is not merely an absorptive organ but rather plays an active role in regulating the rate of production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Metabolic signals in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and in some cases an aberrant intestinal response to these factors all contribute to the enhanced formation and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.","10.1097/MOL.0b013e3282ffaf82","3","221-8","19","0957-9672 (Print)

However mechanisms for the observed dramatic CV benefit remains unclear. We hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibition may have direct effects on coronary microcirculation and cardiac performance via metabolic modulation. To test this hypothesis we used the ob/ob-/- mice which is an obesity insulin resistant model lacking atherosclerosis formation with only mild diabetes progression. It is a rodent model of pre-diabetes which we have previously shown to display coronary microvascular dysfunction. Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the effect of SGLT2i on coronary vascular function in ob/ob-/- male mice from Jackson using Doppler ultrasound imaging. Methods: Non-invasive Doppler guided ultrasound imaging (Vevo 2100 Visual- Sonics Inc Toronto Ontario Canada) was used to characterise coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and fractional area change (FAC) over time (baseline 5 and 10 weeks post treatment). The mice were 9 weeks of age at baseline (22 ob/ob-/- male mice treated with Empagliflozin and 21 untreated ob/ob-/-). Velocity profile in the left coronary artery was measured in the long-axis view and measurement of left ventricle dimensions performed in the short axis view. Spot urine was analysed for glucose albumin creatinine sodium and potassium at all time points as well as blood HbA1c. Results: FAC was higher in the treated group compared to untreated ob/ob-/- after 10 weeks treatment (mean+/-SD 56.6+/-8.4 and 49.1+/-6.7 respectively p=0.0007). There was also a significant change in CFVR in treated group compared with untreated after 10 weeks treatment (Delta CFVR improvement mean+/-SEM 1.3+/-0 vs. 0.6+/-0.3 p=0.0409). With time HbA1c was significantly reduced in the treated group (45.4+/-9.5 37.0+/-5.9 and 36.7+/-4.9 p<0.0001 and increased in untreated group (47.6+/-6.8 59.5+/-13.0 and 56.7+/-19.0 p=0.0009). Urine glucose/creatinine ratio was increased in treated group (mean+/-SEM 30.4+/-7.6 128.3+/-10.7 and 94.8+/-8.9 p<0.0001) and there were no significant changes in untreated (30.9+/-7.7 30.7+/-12.6 22.0+/-13.4 p=ns).

Conference: Resuscitation Science Symposium ReSS","Introduction: In diabetic patients with cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to improve CV outcome. However effects of SGLT2 inhibition on cardiovascular function still remains elusive. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibition may have direct effects on coronary microcirculation and cardiac performance in a dose dependent manner. To test this hypothesis we used the ob/ob mice which is a rodent model of prediabetes with obesity lacks atherosclerosis formation and has previously been shown to display coronary microvascular dysfunction. Methods: High resolution Doppler ultrasound imaging (Vevo 2100 VisualSonics Inc Toronto Canada) was used to characterise coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and fractional area change (FAC) at baseline 5 and 10 weeks post treatment. The mice were 10 weeks of age at baseline (ob/ob male mice treated with 1.5 or 4 mg/kg Dapagliflozin and untreated ob/ob (n=18 per group). Spot urine was analysed for glucose albumin creatinine sodium and potassium at all time points as well as blood HbA1c. Results: There was a trend for reduced FAC with time in the untreated group (mean+/-SD 52.9+/-4.0 49.9+/-5.2 49.9+/-6.2 p=0.0651) and increased FAC in 1.5mg/kg (51.0+/-5.5 52.3+/-5.1 61.2+/-7.3 p<0.0001) and in 4mg/kg (52.0+/-7.2 56.9+/-8.0 57.4+/-5.0 p=0.0173).

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin (AGP) in injured artery. Methods: We investigated intimal hyperplasia in LDL receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) mice (that could be induced more neointimal formation compared with wild-type mice) two weeks after inducing femoral artery injury with an external vascular cuff model. All mice received oral injection of AGP (20mg/kg/day) or normal saline once daily for 14 days. Results: AGP treatment yielded no adverse systemic effects and we observed no significant differences in fasting blood sugar levels serum cholesterol levels or blood pressure in either group. Compared to saline treatment (n=8) however AGP treatment (n=9) significantly reduced intimal hyperplasia (1087 +/- 127 vs. 1896 +/- 140 mum2; P <0.001) and intima/media ratio (0.08 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02; P<0.001).

Immunostaining revealed AGP treatment reduced proliferating cells (PCNA positive nuclei) (P<0.01) and suppressed smooth muscle cell proliferation (alpha-SMA positive cells) (P=0.029) compared to control group. Furthermore Immunostaining for Mac3 and Ly6G revealed significant fewer inflammatory cells in the neointima of AGP treated mice compared with controls (P<0.05 and P<0.01 respectively). These results indicated that AGP decreased inflammation and intimal hyperplasia in injured arteries of LDLr-/- mice. Importantly we also detected similar findings using wild-type mice with (n=10) or without AGP (n=10). Conclusion: Our data suggest that DPP-4 inhibitor AGP suppresses neointimal formation by inhibiting inflammation without relation to its effects for glucose or cholesterol metabolisms in both atherogenic and wild-type mice. This study highlights the potential therapeutic benefit of AGP therapy in preventing intimal hyperplasia and arterial inflammation.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0735-1097%2813%2962048-3","10 SUPPL. 1","E2048","61","0735-1097",1319,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a unique adipose tissue depot in close anatomical proximity and bidirectional functional interaction with the vascular wall which is a source of DPP-IV and its biology may be influenced by DPP-IV inhibition. Recently DPP-IV inhibition has been associated with decreased local inflammation and oxidative stress both in the vascular wall and the PVAT potentially regulating atherogenesis progression in vivo.

Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors are a class of insulin-sensitising agents that may regulate vascular responses to insulin in humans. We attempted to determine the direct vascular effects of insulin in humans with atherosclerosis and explore the effect of DPP4 inhibition on vascular insulin signalling. Methods The study included 613 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Vascular segments (internal mammary arteries (IMA) saphenous veins (SV)) were collected and incubated with insulin glargine active metabolite M1 (insulin) insulin degludec (DEG) and human insulin (HI) (1-100 nM as stated) with or without pre-incubation with KR62436 (a DPP4 inhibitor) at 70 mM. Vascular superoxide (O2.-) was quantified by lucigenin chemiluminescence while nitric oxide bioavailability was evaluated by quantifying the vasorelaxations to acetylcholine. Circulating DPP4 activity was measured in fasting serum using commercially available kits. Downstream signalling was evaluated by Western blotting for protein phosphorylation. Results Insulin increased NADPH-oxidases-derived O2.- in vessels from patients with or without diabetes an effect reversed in vascular segments from diabetic patients pre-treated with an oral DPP4 inhibitor (A). In contrast insulin reduced O2.- in vessels of healthy mice used as controls (not shown). Circulating DPP4 activity was associated with increased vascular NADPH-oxidases activity in the study population (not shown) while ex vivo pre-incubation of human vessels with KR62436 (DPP4-i) reversed the effect of insulin on vascular O2.- supressing NADPH-oxidases activity (B) improving eNOS coupling (C) and ameliorating endothelial dysfunction in human vessels (D). This was a class effect replicated using DEG and HI (data not shown). DPP4 inhibition improved downstream insulin signalling by reducing insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation at Ser307 a site linked to molecular insulin resistance (E). The vascular effects of DPP4 inhibition may be regulated via AMPK since DPP4-i increased AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation while AMPK inhibition with compound C reversed the protective vascular effects of DPP4-I (F). Conclusions We demonstrate for the first time that insulin induces oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in vascular segments from patients with atherosclerosis independently of systemic insulin resistance. This may partially explain the inability of insulin treatment to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with moderately elevated blood glucose. Pre-treatment with a DPP4 inhibitor restores local insulin sensitivity modulating the vascular responses to insulin.

Results: Induction of diabetes resulted in a dramatic increase in plasma cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels. These mice also exhibited an increased number of circulating monocytes and neutrophils. Monocytosis was driven by increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Tighter glycemic control by SGLT2i treatment not only reduced monocytosis and atherosclerosis but also improved plasma lipoprotein profile. Interestingly improved lipoprotein profile was not due to decreased TG synthesis or clearance via low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Lrp) 1 or scavenger receptor class B member (Scarb1) pathways but likely mediated by heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)-dependent clearance mechanisms in the liver. Further examination of the liver revealed an important role for bile acid transporters (Abcg5 Abcg8) and cytochrome P450 enzymes in the clearance of hepatic cholesterol. Conclusions: These data suggest that tighter glycemic control in diabetes can improve lipoprotein clearance exclusive of Ldlr likely via HSPG and bile acid pathways and has an overall net positive effect on atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2018.02.028",NA,"166-176","271","0021-9150

We previously showed that hyperglycemia independently promotes monocytosis and impairs the resolution of atherosclerosis. Since patients with chronic diabetes often develop dyslipidemia and also have increased risk for atherosclerosis we sought to examine how controlling blood glucose affects atherosclerosis development in the presence of severe hyperlipidemia.

F.","Anti-obesogenic and hypolipidemic effects of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist derived from the saliva of the Gila monster",2017,"Toxicon","Introduction Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (R) agonists are a class of incretin mimetic drugs that have been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and also considered strong candidates for the treatment of obesity. The original prototypical drug in this class is the exenatide a synthetic peptide with the same structure as the native molecule exendin-4 found in the saliva of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum suspectum lizard). Objectives To identify and compare the anti-obesogenic antidyslipidemic and antidiabetogenic effects of agonism in GLP-1R by exenatide on two distinct models of obesity: induced by hypothalamic injury (MSG) or high-calorie diet (DIO). Methods To obtain MSG neonatal rats were daily subcutaneously injected with 4 g monosodium glutamate/kg for 10 consecutive days. To obtain DIO 72-75 days old rats received hyperlipid food and 30% sucrose for drinking up to 142-145 days old. Untreated healthy rats with the same age were used as control. General biometric and metabolic parameters were measured. Results MSG was characterized by decreased naso-anal length food and fluid intake plasma protein and glucose decay rate per minute after insulin administration (K<inf>ITT</inf>) as well as increased Lee index (body mass<sup>0.33</sup>/naso-anal length) mass of retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat pads glycemia triglycerides (TG) LDL and VLDL. Exenatide ameliorated K<inf>ITT</inf> and food and fluid intake and it also restored glycemia in MSG. DIO was characterized by glucose intolerance increased body mass Lee index fluid intake mass of retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat pads glycemia glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) TG VLDL and total cholesterol as well as decreased food intake and K<inf>ITT</inf>. Exenatide restored glycemia HbA1c TG VLDL total cholesterol and body mass and it also ameliorated food and fluid intake K<inf>ITT</inf> and mass of retroperitoneal fat pad in DIO. Conclusions The hypothalamic injury and the high-calorie diet induce dyslipidemia and glycemic dysregulation in addition to obesity in rats. The usual therapeutic dose of exenatide in humans is antidiabetogenic in both these obesity models but is anti-obesogenic and hypolipidemic only in diet-induced obesity.

The original prototypical drug in this class is the exenatide a synthetic peptide with the same structure as the native molecule exendin-4 found in the saliva of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum suspectum lizard). OBJECTIVES: To identify and compare the anti-obesogenic antidyslipidemic and antidiabetogenic effects of agonism in GLP-1R by exenatide on two distinct models of obesity: induced by hypothalamic injury (MSG) or high-calorie diet (DIO). METHODS: To obtain MSG neonatal rats were daily subcutaneously injected with 4 g monosodium glutamate/kg for 10 consecutive days. To obtain DIO 72-75 days old rats received hyperlipid food and 30% sucrose for drinking up to 142-145 days old. Untreated healthy rats with the same age were used as control. General biometric and metabolic parameters were measured. RESULTS: MSG was characterized by decreased naso-anal length food and fluid intake plasma protein and glucose decay rate per minute after insulin administration (KITT) as well as increased Lee index (body mass(0.33)/naso-anal length) mass of retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat pads glycemia triglycerides (TG) LDL and VLDL. Exenatide ameliorated KITT and food and fluid intake and it also restored glycemia in MSG. DIO was characterized by glucose intolerance increased body mass Lee index fluid intake mass of retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat pads glycemia glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) TG VLDL and total cholesterol as well as decreased food intake and KITT. Exenatide restored glycemia HbA1c TG VLDL total cholesterol and body mass and it also ameliorated food and fluid intake KITT and mass of retroperitoneal fat pad in DIO. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic injury and the high-calorie diet induce dyslipidemia and glycemic dysregulation in addition to obesity in rats. The usual therapeutic dose of exenatide in humans is antidiabetogenic in both these obesity models but is anti-obesogenic and hypolipidemic only in diet-induced obesity.

However their effects on atherosclerogenesis have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GLP-1 on accumulation of monocytes/macrophages on the vascular wall one of the earliest steps in atherosclerogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After continuous infusion of low (300 pmol . kg(-1) . day(-1)) or high (24 nmol . kg(-1) . day(-1)) dose of exendin-4 in C57BL/6 or apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoE(-/-)) we evaluated monocyte adhesion to the endothelia of thoracic aorta and arteriosclerotic lesions around the aortic valve. The effects of exendin-4 were investigated in mouse macrophages and human monocytes. RESULTS: Treatment with exendin-4 significantly inhibited monocytic adhesion in the aortas of C57BL/6 mice without affecting metabolic parameters. In apoE(-/-) mice the same treatment reduced monocyte adhesion to the endothelium and suppressed atherosclerogenesis. In vitro treatment of mouse macrophages with exendin-4 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and suppressed nuclear translocation of p65 a component of nuclear factor-kappaB. This effect was reversed by either MDL-12330A a cAMP inhibitor or PKI(14-22) a protein kinase A-specific inhibitor. In human monocytes exendin-4 reduced the expression of CD11b. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the arterial wall by inhibiting the inflammatory response in macrophages and that this effect may contribute to the attenuation of atherosclerotic lesion by exendin-4.","10.2337/db09-1694","4","1030-7","59","0012-1797",10,"In_database","unique"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GLP-1 on accumulation of monocytes/macrophages on the vascular wall one of the earliest steps in atherosclerogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After continuous infusion of low (300 pmol . kg(-1) . day(-1)) or high (24 nmol . kg(-1) . day(-1)) dose of exendin-4 in C57BL/6 or apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoE(-/-)) we evaluated monocyte adhesion to the endothelia of thoracic aorta and arteriosclerotic lesions around the aortic valve. The effects of exendin-4 were investigated in mouse macrophages and human monocytes. RESULTS: Treatment with exendin-4 significantly inhibited monocytic adhesion in the aortas of C57BL/6 mice without affecting metabolic parameters. In apoE(-/-) mice the same treatment reduced monocyte adhesion to the endothelium and suppressed atherosclerogenesis. In vitro treatment of mouse macrophages with exendin-4 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and suppressed nuclear translocation of p65 a component of nuclear factor-kappaB. This effect was reversed by either MDL-12330A a cAMP inhibitor or PKI(14-22) a protein kinase A-specific inhibitor. In human monocytes exendin-4 reduced the expression of CD11b.

Some medications may have safety concerns in patients with HF (TZDs certain DPP-4i's sulfonylureas insulin) while others could be potentially beneficial (metformin SGLT2i) but may need to be used with caution in particular sub-groups (e.g. advanced kidney disease). We used DCR to evaluate current patterns of glucose-lowering medication use in adults with T2D with and without HF. Materials and methods: DCR is a US-based outpatient registry of adults with diabetes seen in primary care cardiology and endocrinology practices and includes 5114 providers from 374 practices. We compared use of glucose-lowering medications in adults with T2D with vs. without HF. We used hierarchical modified Poisson regression models to examine whether HF was associated with preferential use of each medication class adjusting for factors that could impact selection of one medication class over another: age chronic kidney disease (CKD) coronary artery disease (CAD) number of glucose-lowering medications and insurance. Site was included as a random effect to account for clustering of patients within sites. Results: Among 669308 adults with T2D on at least 1 glucose-lowering medication 179133 (27%) had a diagnosis of HF (29% HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] 71% HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). Patients with T2D and HF (compared with no HF) were more likely to be older men and to have CAD atrial fibrillation and CKD. In unadjusted comparisons those with HF were more likely to be treated with insulin and sulfonylureas and less likely to be treated with metformin TZD DPP-4i GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i (Table). These associations remained significant after adjustment for patient factors and site with the most prominent associations ofHF with greater use of insulin and less use of metformin TZD and SGLT2i (Table). Conclusion: In a large US-based outpatient registry we found that a quarter of adults with T2D had a diagnosis of HF which was predominantly HFpEF. Although some patterns of T2D medication use in patients with vs. without HF seemed consistent with existing evidence (less use of TZD and potentially DPP-4i) others appeared contrary to evidence (less use of metformin and SGLT2i).

The extract of Ligularia fischeri leaves (LFE) is traditionally used as a folk medicine for treating inflammatory diseases in Korea as well. In this study we investigated the synergistic effect of MCE combined with LFE on antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic potentials. Based on the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect and promotion of adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell line the MLM was prepared with MCE:LFE (8:2 weight:weight). MLM showed the synergistic effects in the promotion of the glucose uptake rate suppression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) mRNA expression upregulation of an insulin receptor substrate and glucose transporter type-4 expression and an increase in insulin-associated signaling in C2C12 cells. In addition the efficacy of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonism and glucose uptake rate by MLM supplementation was significantly enhanced in vitro. Then the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of MCE LFE and MLM at the dose of 50 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (n = 6 per each group) were determined in streptozotocin (STZ)-insulted mice fed an atherogenic diet (ATH) for 4 weeks. In addition MLM (50 100 and 200 mg/kg/day n = 5 per each group) was supplemented in ATH-fed db/db mice for 10 weeks. Compared with MCE or LFE alone MLM supplementation led to a more significant reduction of glucose levels in both STZ/ATH and db/db/ATH mice as well as lowered lipid profiles in STZ/ATH mice. In addition the stimulation of islet of Langerhans regeneration was more pronounced by MLM supplementation in both mice models. In conclusion antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects were strengthened by the combined extracts of L. fischeri and M. charantia (MLM) in diabetes-mimicking mice.Copyright © 2018 Hyun Jin Baek et al.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3468040",NA,"3468040","2018","1741-427X

We aimed to determine whether RS dose-dependently reduces adiposity in obesity-prone (OP) and obesity-resistant (OR) rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=120) were fed a moderate-fat high-energy diet for 4 wk. Rats that gained the most weight (40%) were classified as obesity-prone (OP) and obesity-resistant (OR) rats were the 40% that gained the least weight. OP and OR rats were randomly allocated to one of six groups (n=8 for each phenotype). One group was killed for baseline measurements the other five groups were allocated to AIN-93 based diets that contained 0 4 8 12 and 16% RS (as high amylose maize starch) for 4 wk.

Although not currently recommended by National Institute of Clinical Excellence for Type 2 diabetes CSII therapy may be an effective treatment for some insulin-resistant patients. We report a patient with insulin-resistant Type 2 diabetes who showed a dramatic and sustained glycaemic response to CSII therapy when other treatment modalities had failed. Case: We report a 56-year-old man with Type 2 diabetes complicated by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease atrial fibrillation hypertension and neuropathy. Prior to commencing CSII therapy HbA1c was >114mmol/mol despite basal-bolus insulin therapy with Apidra and Lantus totalling 490 units/day (6.3 units/kg) and intensive education and support from the specialist diabetes team. Non-insulin therapies including met-formin gliclazide liraglutide pioglitazone gliclazide canagliflozin and sitagliptin had been inefficacious or not-tolerated. Weight at baseline was 78kg and body mass index was 27.4kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Funding for CSII therapy was approved by his CCG following an Individual Funding Request. Treatment was commenced with Apidra using the Medtronic 640G system with structured education and support from the specialist team. Six weeks post CSII he reported feeling 'terrific' with HbA1c 69mmol/mol and insulin requirements of 67 units/day (0.78 units/kg). Over 18 months his HbA1c ranged between 38 and 55 mmol/mol insulin requirements of 52 units/day (0.55 units/kg) at 18 months and no significant hypo-glycaemia. Despite weight gain of 16kg and undergoing CABG he continues to feel well.

Our objective was to study exe4 and liraglutide postconditioning (PostC) in hearts with LVH isolated from hypertensive SHR-SP (hypertensive LVH) rats. Methods Hearts isolated from WKY (control) and SHR-SP rats (11-15 weeks old) were subjected to 35 min LAD occlusion-2 hours reperfusion with exe4 0.3 nmol/L or liraglutide 0.3 nmol/L present during the first 15 minute in treated hearts. Evans blue/TTC method was used to determine area-at-risk (AAR) and infarct size (% of AAR). Akt phosphorylation (Akt-P) was measured on western blots after 3 minute of reperfusion. Arterial blood pressure (BP) was measured in conscious animals by tail cuff method. Results BP and heart/body weight ratio were increased in SHR-SP compared to WKY rats (P < 0.0001 for both parameters). Infarcts were larger in SHR-SP than in WKY after 35 min of ischemia (65.7 +/- 3.2 N = 7 vs 37.1 +/- 3.4 N = 12 respectively; P < 0.05). Exe-4 and liraglutide PostC decreased infarct size (IS) after 35 min ischemia in WKY (P < 0.05) but not after 45 min. Liraglutide and preconditioning but not Exe-4 decreased IS after 35 min in SHR-SP (P < 0.05). Exe4 PostC decreased IS after 15 min ischemia in SHR-SP (P < 0.05). In WKY hearts exe4 treatment significantly decreased diastolic contracture and increased left ventricle developed pressure. Liraglutide but not exe4 decreased diastolic pressure in SHR hearts. In SHR-SP hearts Akt-P/Akt ratios were significantly reduced in both I/R and PostC subgroups (n = 5 P < 0.05). Discussion These data suggest that 0.3 nmol/L liraglutide was more effective than 0.3 nM exe4 in limiting reperfusion injury in both WKY and SHR-SP.

In addition to their improvement of glycemic control animal studies have suggested an independent anti-atherosclerotic effect of gliptins. Nevertheless recent clinical trials regarding long-term effects of gliptin therapy on vascular events have been disappointing. This discrepancy led us to better dissect the functional role of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling as a potential mechanism underlying gliptin action. The study should give improved understanding of the potential of gliptin therapy in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an ApoE-/- mouse model on high cholesterol diet long-term treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin significantly reduced atherosclerosic plaque load in the aorta. Flow cytometry analyses showed an enrichment of M2 macrophages in the aortic wall under gliptin therapy. Importantly the number of recruited CD206+ macrophages was inversely correlated with total plaque area while no correlation was found for the overall macrophage population or M1 macrophages. Blockade of CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling by AMD3100 inhibited aortic M2 accumulation and the therapeutic effect of Sitagliptin.

We analyzed the effect of pharmacological DPP-4-inhibition by Sitagliptin on endogenous progenitor cell-based endothelial regeneration via the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4-axis after acute endothelial damage in a mouse model of carotid injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Induction of a defined endothelial injury was performed in the carotid artery of C57Bl/6 mice which led to a local upregulation of SDF-1alpha expression. Animals were treated with placebo Sitagliptin or Sitagliptin+AMD3100. Using mass spectrometry we could prove that Sitagliptin prevented cleavage of the chemokine SDF-1alpha. Accordingly increased SDF-1alpha concentrations enhanced recruitment of systemically applied and endogenous circulating CXCR4+ progenitor cells to the site of vascular injury followed by a significantly accelerated reendothelialization as compared to placebo-treated animals. Improved endothelial recovery as well as recruitment of circulating CXCR4+ progenitor cells (CD133+ Flk1+) was reversed by CXCR4-antagonization through AMD3100. In addition short-term Sitagliptin treatment did not significantly promote neointimal or medial hyperplasia. CONCLUSION: Sitagliptin can accelerate endothelial regeneration after acute endothelial injury. DPP-4 inhibitors prevent degradation of the chemokine SDF-1alpha and thus improve the recruitment of regenerative circulating CXCR4+ progenitor cells which mediate local endothelial cell proliferation without adversely affecting vessel wall architecture.","10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.09.016","1","266-75","177","0167-5273",1636,"In_database","duplicate"

This decreased function is also associated with decreased myocardial microcirculatory function in swine. The endogenous incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has demonstrated benefits in ischemic models including reduction in myocardial infarction size and improvement of left ventricular function. However these benefits have not been evaluated following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that post-resuscitation administration of GLP-1 would improve myocardial microcirculatory function. Methods Used: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in domestic swine (n = 20; 30-35kg) and left untreated for 8 minutes before aggressive ACLS was performed to restore spontaneous circulation. After return of spontaneous circulation animals were blindly randomized to post-resuscitation infusions of either GLP-1 (American Peptide 10 pM/kg/min) or an equal volume of saline for 4 hours. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) performed prearrest and at 1 and 4 hours post-resuscitation was measured using a standard technique of intracoronary Doppler flow measurements before and after intracoronary administration of 60 mcg adenosine. In this study low CFR indicates abnormal myocardial microcirculatory function since these swine had no obstructive coronary artery disease.

Consistently GIPR mRNA was higher in carotid arteries of diabetic Ins2Akita mice than in non-diabetic controls. We also examined GIPR mRNA expression in 150 human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and found significantly elevated levels in patients with clinical symptoms. Collectively these results suggest remarkable plasticity of GIPR expression of potential relevance for GIP-signaling in the vasculature.",NA,"Meeting Astracts",NA,"25","0892-6638",1383,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

J.","Effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on systemic and tissue low-grade inflammation: The potential contribution to diabetes complications and cardiovascular disease",2018,"Diabetes and Metabolism","Chronic low-grade inflammation is a recognized key feature associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. In prospective randomized trials sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated benefits related to several cardiovascular and renal risk factors including HbA1c blood pressure body weight renal hyperfiltration and improvement of cardiorenal outcomes. SGLT2 inhibitors may improve adipose tissue function and induce decreases in serum leptin TNF-alpha and IL-6 while increasing adiponectin. While data on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers are relatively scarce in humans in animals a number of reports have shown reductions in cytokine and chemokine concentrations in parallel with protective effects against progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Experimental findings also suggest that part of the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition may be related to anti-inflammatory actions at the kidney level. Underlying mechanisms to explain this anti-inflammatory effect are multiple but may involve weight loss and reduction in adipose tissue inflammation slight increase in ketone bodies and diminution of uric acid levels or attenuation of oxidative stress. However further studies in diabetes patients with specific assessment of inflammatory markers are still necessary to determine the specific contribution of the anti-inflammatory action of SGLT2 inhibitors to the reduction of cardiovascular and renal complications and mortality observed with this class of antidiabetic drugs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2018.09.005","6","457-464","44","1262-3636

Disturbances in the endothelial integrity can lead to insufficient blood supply and bear the risk of thrombus formation and acute vascular occlusion. At present effective therapeutics to restore endothelial integrity are barely available. We analyzed the effect of pharmacological DPP-4-inhibition by Sitagliptin on endogenous progenitor cell-based endothelial regeneration via the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4-axis after acute endothelial damage in a mouse model of carotid injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Induction of a defined endothelial injury was performed in the carotid artery of C57Bl/6 mice which led to a local upregulation of SDF-1alpha expression. Animals were treated with placebo Sitagliptin or Sitagliptin+AMD3100. Using mass spectrometry we could prove that Sitagliptin prevented cleavage of the chemokine SDF-1alpha. Accordingly increased SDF-1alpha concentrations enhanced recruitment of systemically applied and endogenous circulating CXCR4+ progenitor cells to the site of vascular injury followed by a significantly accelerated reendothelialization as compared to placebo-treated animals. Improved endothelial recovery as well as recruitment of circulating CXCR4+ progenitor cells (CD133+ Flk1+) was reversed by CXCR4-antagonization through AMD3100. In addition short-term Sitagliptin treatment did not significantly promote neointimal or medial hyperplasia. CONCLUSION: Sitagliptin can accelerate endothelial regeneration after acute endothelial injury.

Recent evidence has suggested the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide can attenuate pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages. We hypothesized that liraglutide could limit atherosclerosis progression in vivo via modulation of the inflammatory response. METHODS: Human THP-1 macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages from both wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) and apolipoprotein E null mice (ApoE(-/-)) were used to investigate the effect of liraglutide on the inflammatory response in vitro. In parallel ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat (60% calories from fat) high-cholesterol (1%) diet for 8 weeks to induce atherosclerotic disease progression with/without daily 300 mug/kg liraglutide administration for the final 6 weeks. Macrophages were analysed for MPhi1 and MPhi2 macrophage markers by Western blotting RT-qPCR ELISA and flow cytometry. Atherosclerotic lesions in aortae from ApoE(-/-) mice were analysed by en face staining and monocyte and macrophage populations from bone marrow derived cells analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Liraglutide decreased atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE(-/-) mice coincident with a reduction in pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory monocyte/macrophage populations in vivo.

Liraglutide decreased IL-1beta in MPhi0 THP-1 macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT mice and induced a significant increase in the MPhi2 surface marker mannose receptor in both MPhi0 and MPhi2 macrophages. Significant reduction in total lesion development was found with once daily 300 mug/kg liraglutide treatment in ApoE(-/-) mice. Interestingly liraglutide inhibited disease progression at the iliac bifurcation suggesting that it retards the initiation and development of disease. These results corresponded to attenuated MPhi1 markers (CCR7 IL-6 and TNF-alpha) augmented MPhi2 cell markers (Arg-1 IL-10 and CD163) and finally decreased MPhi1-like monocytes and macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells. CONCLUSIONS: This data supports a therapeutic role for liraglutide as an atheroprotective agent via modulating macrophage cell fate towards MPhi2 pro-resolving macrophages.","10.1186/s12933-017-0626-3","1","143","16","1475-2840",753,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Recent evidence has suggested the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide can attenuate pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages. We hypothesized that liraglutide could limit atherosclerosis progression in vivo via modulation of the inflammatory response. Methods: Human THP-1 macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages from both wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) and apolipoprotein E null mice (ApoE-/-) were used to investigate the effect of liraglutide on the inflammatory response in vitro. In parallel ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat (60% calories from fat) high-cholesterol (1%) diet for 8 weeks to induce atherosclerotic disease progression with/without daily 300 mug/kg liraglutide administration for the final 6 weeks. Macrophages were analysed for MPHI1 and MPHI2 macrophage markers by Western blotting RT-qPCR ELISA and flow cytometry. Atherosclerotic lesions in aortae from ApoE-/- mice were analysed by en face staining and monocyte and macrophage populations from bone marrow derived cells analysed by flow cytometry. Results: Liraglutide decreased atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE-/- mice coincident with a reduction in pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory monocyte/macrophage populations in vivo.

METHODS: Adult male SD rats were categorized into 4 groups: sham control IR injury IR+sitagliptin (300 mg/kg) and IR+sitagliptin (600 mg/kg). Acute renal IR injury of both kidneys was induced by clamping the renal pedicles for 1 h. The drug was orally administered at 1 24 and 48 h after acute IR.

The kidney injury score inflammatory biomarkers (MMP-9 TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) levels and CD68+ cells in IR kidneys were considerably increased. The expression of oxidized protein reactive oxygen species (NOX-1 NOX-2) and apoptosis proteins (Bax caspase-3 PARP) in IR kidneys was also significantly upregulated.

The improved survival of septic animals shown here may warrant further clinical evaluation of these drugs in patients with septic shock beyond the potential improvement of inflammatory complications in diabetic individuals.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db14-833-1316","SUPPL. 1","A295","63","0012-1797",1257,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

As patients with diabetes are at a high risk to develop a severe atherosclerosis we investigated the effect of GLP-1 on chemokine-induced migration of human monocytes and macrophage MMP-9 expression both crucial steps in atherogenesis and plaque destabilisation. Furthermore we explored the translation of these effects to plaque inflammation and plaque stability in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice treated with the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin which increases plasma levels of active GLP-1. Methods and Results: In the modified Boyden-chamber pretreatment with GLP-1 reduced the MCP-1 induced migration of isolated human monocytes in a concentration dependent manner from a 3.3+/-0.8 to a 1.4+/-0.5 fold induction at 10 nM GLP-1 (n = 8 p < 0.05) which was associated with a decreased MLC-phosphorylation in these cells.

Here we determined whether delayed treatment with a GLP-1R agonist could improve metabolic and functional recovery after stroke. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and given the well-established GLP-1R agonist liraglutide (50 100 or 200 mug/kg) or normal saline (NS) daily for 4 weeks starting 1 day after MCAO. Cerebral glucose metabolism and neurological deficits were evaluated using <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test. Levels of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) von Willebrand factor (vWF) and GLP-1R were assessed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. PET imaging showed that animals treated with liraglutide had significantly higher <sup>18</sup>F-FDG accumulation in the cerebral infarction compared with animals treated with NS.

Here we determined whether delayed treatment with a GLP-1R agonist could improve metabolic and functional recovery after stroke. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and given the well-established GLP-1R agonist liraglutide (50 100 or 200 mug/kg) or normal saline (NS) daily for 4 weeks starting 1 day after MCAO. Cerebral glucose metabolism and neurological deficits were evaluated using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test. Levels of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) von Willebrand factor (vWF) and GLP-1R were assessed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. PET imaging showed that animals treated with liraglutide had significantly higher 18F-FDG accumulation in the cerebral infarction compared with animals treated with NS.

This class of drugs has shown promising results in glycemic control and most importantly to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk. Despite the encouraging data there is concern regarding their potential for causing or worsening peripheral artery disease (PAD) which may increase the risk of lower extremity amputations. Following the publication of results of CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials which revealed that leg and mid-foot amputations occurred about twice as often in patients treated with canagliflozin compared to placebo the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States issued a black box warning of leg and foot amputations associated with canagliflozin use. In this article our main aim is to review the available evidence in preclinical and clinical studies regarding SGLT-2 inhibitors and PAD events the possible mechanisms related to increased risk of amputation to evaluate whether it is a class effect or individual drug effect and most importantly implications for their continued use as antidiabetic agents. It also raises the issue of including PAD events among the end-points when assessing future antihyperglycemic agents. Thus we also tried to analyze whether outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors trials mostly focused on stroke myocardial infarction heart failure and peripheral vascular disease-related outcomes remained underrated.

K.","Predictors and prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy",2013,"Diabetes Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy","Despite our cognizance that diabetes can enhance the chances of heart failure causes multiorgan failureand contributes to morbidity and mortality it is rapidly increasing menace worldwide. Less attention has been paid to alert prediabetics through determining the comprehensive predictors of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ameliorating DCM using novel approaches. DCM is recognized as asymptomatic progressing structural and functional remodeling in the heart of diabetics in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension. The three major stages of DCM are: (1) early stage where cellular and metabolic changes occur without obvious systolic dysfunction; (2) middle stage which is characterized by increased apoptosis a slight increase in left ventricular size and diastolic dysfunction and where ejection fraction (EF) is <50%; and (3) late stage which is characterized by alteration in microvasculature compliance an increase in left ventricular size and a decrease in cardiac performance leading to heart failure. Recent investigations have revealed that DCM is multifactorial in nature and cellular molecular and metabolic perturbations predisposed and contributed to DCM. Differential expression of microRNA (miRNA) signaling molecules involved in glucose metabolism hyperlipidemia advanced glycogen end products cardiac extracellular matrix remodeling and alteration in survival and differentiation of resident cardiac stem cells are manifested in DCM.

K.","Predictors and prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy",2013,"Diabetes Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy","Despite our cognizance that diabetes can enhance the chances of heart failure causes multiorgan failureand contributes to morbidity and mortality it is rapidly increasing menace worldwide. Less attention has been paid to alert prediabetics through determining the comprehensive predictors of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ameliorating DCM using novel approaches. DCM is recognized as asymptomatic progressing structural and functional remodeling in the heart of diabetics in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension. The three major stages of DCM are: (1) early stage where cellular and metabolic changes occur without obvious systolic dysfunction; (2) middle stage which is characterized by increased apoptosis a slight increase in left ventricular size and diastolic dysfunction and where ejection fraction (EF) is <50%; and (3) late stage which is characterized by alteration in microvasculature compliance an increase in left ventricular size and a decrease in cardiac performance leading to heart failure. Recent investigations have revealed that DCM is multifactorial in nature and cellular molecular and metabolic perturbations predisposed and contributed to DCM. Differential expression of microRNA (miRNA) signaling molecules involved in glucose metabolism hyperlipidemia advanced glycogen end products cardiac extracellular matrix remodeling and alteration in survival and differentiation of resident cardiac stem cells are manifested in DCM. A sedentary lifestyle and high fat diet causes obesity and this leads to type 2 diabetes and DCM. However exercise training improves insulin sensitivity contractility of cardiomyocytes and cardiac performance in type 2 diabetes. These findings provide new clues to diagnose and mitigate DCM.

We therefore aimed to investigate the acute effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on vascular function in rats with high-sucrose diet-induced MetS. In order to elucidate the mechanisms implicated in the effects of DPP-4 inhibition we tested the involvement of NO pathway and epigenetic regulation in the MetS. Acute use of sitagliptin protects the vascular function in the rats with MetS in part due to NO pathway via restoring the depressed aortic relaxation responses mediated by receptors. Application of sitagliptin enhanced the depressed phosphorylation levels of both the endothelial NO synthase and the apoptotic status of protein kinase B known as Akt in endothelium-intact thoracic aorta from rats with MetS. One-hour application of sitagliptin on aortic rings from rats with MetS also induced remarkable histon posttranslational modifications such as increased expression of H3K27Me3 but not of H3K27Me2 resulting in an accumulation of the H3K27Me3. Our findings suggest that in addition to its well-known hypoglycemic action sitagliptin may also have beneficial effects on hyperglycemia-induced vascular changes in an endotheium-dependent manner. These present results with sitagliptin aside from the glycaemic control may demonstrate its important role in the treatment of patients with MetS.","10.1007/s11033-014-3392-2","8","4853-63","41","0301-4851",35,"In_database","unique"

Methods: ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were bred in an SPF environment. The mice were randomly divided into the normal diet group and the high-fat diet group. After 12 weeks some of the mice were analysed randomly for HE staining of the aortic arch and to validate the model of atherosclerosis. After establishing a successful model the mice were administered different drug (atorvastatin exenatide and sitagliptin) interventions for 6 weeks. Next we collected blood samples from the retro-orbital venous plexus of the mice after overnight fasting and blood glucose detection and then the sampled mice were killed. Fasting serum insulin (FINS) and hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was identified using a selective precipitation assay. Results: Feeding with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks in the high-fat diet group revealed early plaque formation of AS but without the lipid core and thickening of the intima-media as compared with the normal diet group. This result suggested that the model of AS was successful. After the drug interventions for 6 weeks FINS levels in the exenatide high-dose group were significantly decreased compared with the other groups (P=0.008 0.005 0.032 0.021 0.047 0.017 all P<0.05). The FINS levels in the exenatide low-dose group were decreased compared with the non-drug group (P=0.046 P<0.05). However the insulin resistance index and insulin sensitivity index were not significantly different (P>0.05). The levels of hs-CRP in the exenatide low/ high-dose groups were significantly decreased compared with the sitagliptin low/high-dose groups the normal diet group and the non-drug intervention group (P=0.050 0.011 0.003 0.004 P=0.042 0.003 0.001 0.001 all P<0.05). The hs-CRP levels in the sitagliptin low/high-dose group showed a much greater decrease than those in the normal diet group and the non-drug intervention group but this change was not significantly different (P>0.05). The levels of LDL-C in the exenatide and sitagliptin groups and the normal diet group were lower than those in the non-drug intervention group and the atorvastatin group (all P<0.05). Conclusions: Under conditions with a similar degree of insulin functions exenatide and sitagliptin could down-regulate the levels of hs-CRP and LDL-C in a model of atherosclerosis in apoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Furthermore exenatide was a much better option than sitagliptin because it decreased cardiovascular disease risk factors and reduced endothelial damage to protect the cardiovascular system.",NA,NA,"51","3",NA,1561,"In_database","duplicate"

Conference: Resuscitation Science Symposium ReSS","Introduction: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor of various CVD including hypertension and atherosclerosis. HHcy induces excessive oxidative stress to impair endothelial function by lowering bioavailability of the major endothelium-derived vasodilator NO. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) directly binds to its receptor in vasculature to reduce ROS production and increase NO level. Previously we showed that GLP-1R agonist exenatide ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive rats. Hypothesis: We propose to study the vascular benefits of enzymatically stable GLP-1 analogues like exendin-4 against HHcyinduced endothelial dysfunction. Methods: Functional assays by organ bath and myograph are carried out to evaluate the effect of exendin-4 on vascular tone in terms of endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) of Hcy-treated (300 muM) rat and mouse aortae and porcine circumflex arteries.

Results and Conclusions: Functional assays show that exendin-4 restores Hcy-impaired EDRs in both SD rat aortae and porcine circumflex arteries where the latter share closer susceptibility to CVD compared to human arteries. Confocal microscopy shows that exendin-4 pre-treatment in endothelial cells and aortic walls of SD rats reduces DHE fluorescence indicating its oxidative stress-lowering effect.

Microvascular rarefaction and endothelial dysfunction have also been linked with MetS and recent evidence from clinical studies supports the efficacy of incretin-based antidiabetic therapies for vascular protection in diabetes. Previous studies pointed out the importance of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition in endothelial cells due to getting protection against metabolic pathologies. We therefore aimed to investigate the acute effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on vascular function in rats with high-sucrose diet-induced MetS. In order to elucidate the mechanisms implicated in the effects of DPP-4 inhibition we tested the involvement of NO pathway and epigenetic regulation in the MetS. Acute use of sitagliptin protects the vascular function in the rats with MetS in part due to NO pathway via restoring the depressed aortic relaxation responses mediated by receptors. Application of sitagliptin enhanced the depressed phosphorylation levels of both the endothelial NO synthase and the apoptotic status of protein kinase B known as Akt in endothelium-intact thoracic aorta from rats with MetS. One-hour application of sitagliptin on aortic rings from rats with MetS also induced remarkable histon posttranslational modifications such as increased expression of H3K27Me3 but not of H3K27Me2 resulting in an accumulation of the H3K27Me3. Our findings suggest that in addition to its well-known hypoglycemic action sitagliptin may also have beneficial effects on hyperglycemia-induced vascular changes in an endotheium-dependent manner. These present results with sitagliptin aside from the glycaemic control may demonstrate its important role in the treatment of patients with MetS.","10.1007/s11033-014-3392-2","8","4853-63","41","0301-4851",766,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Left ventricular (LV) haemodynamics LV ejection fraction cardiac output and coronary flow reserve (CFR) [using a standard technique of intracoronary Doppler flow measurements before and after intracoronary administration of 60 microg adenosine] were performed pre-arrest and at 1 and 4h post-resuscitation. In the present study CFR is a measure of myocardial microcirculatory function since these swine had no obstructive coronary artery disease. Twenty-four hour post-resuscitation survival and neurological functional scores were also determined. RESULTS: CFR was significantly increased in GLP-1-treated animals 1h (1.79+/-0.13 in control animals vs. 2.05+/-0.12 in GLP-1-treated animals P = <0.05) and 4h (1.82+/-0.16 in control animals vs. 2.31+/-0.13 in GLP-1-treated animals P = <0.05) after ROSC. In addition compared to PBO-treated animals GLP-1 increased cardiac output 1h after ROSC (2.1+/-0.1 in control animals vs. 2.7+/-0.2 in GLP-1-treated animals P = <0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between GLP-1-treated (100%) and PBO-treated animals (78%). CONCLUSIONS: In this swine model of prolonged VF followed by successful resuscitation myocardial microcirculatory function was enhanced with administration of GLP-1. However GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a clinically significant improvement in post-resuscitation myocardial function.","10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.01.031","6","755-60","81","0300-9572",771,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Among these is stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) a pro-angiogenic and cardiomyocyte protective protein that is currently in human trials for ischaemic heart disease. Accordingly we hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition may confer benefit following myocardial infarction (MI) in the diabetic setting as a consequence of enhanced SDF-1 availability rather than potentiating GLP-1. To test this hypothesis we compared DPP-4 inhibition with GLP-1 agonism. In order to demonstrate SDF-1 specificity we then antagonised SDF-1's cognate receptor CXCR4 with AMD3100. Materials and methods: To avoid the confounding effects of glucose-lowering of GLP-1 studies were conducted in Fischer F344 rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetes. Rats were randomized to receive the DPP-4 inhibitor saxaglitpin (10 mg/kg/d) liraglutide (1mg/kg/sc/d) saxagliptin and AMD3100 (1mg/kg/sc) or vehicle. Two weeks later animals underwent experimental MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cardiac function assessed by conductance catheterisation and echocardiography were examined 4 weeks post-MI. Results: Glycemic control was similar in all groups as was MI size systolic BP and heart size (P=NS). DPP-4 activity was increased in diabetic animals when compared with control and reduced by saxagliptin treatment (p<0.05). Four weeks post MI mortality was reduced in saxagliptin-treated animals when compared with those receiving vehicle (p<0.05). When compared with untreated post-MI rats those receiving saxagliptin had improved fractional shortening (p<0.05) and better function in both early and late phases of diastole as measured by Tau and the slope of the end diastolic pressure-volume relationship respectively (p<0.05 for both). By contrast cardiac function in liraglutide-treated animals closely resembled that of vehicle-treated animals. Antagonism of CXCR4 in saxagliptin-treated animals prevented the improvement in systolic and diastolic function and was associated with increased mortality (all p<0.05) when compared with saxagliptin-treated animals. Conclusion: Saxagliptin-mediated DPP-4 inhibition but not liraglutidemediated GLP-1 agonism improved ventricular systolic and diastolic function post myocardial infarction in a model of type 1 diabetes.

Clinical trials have indicated potential cardiovascular benefits of liraglutide a GLP-1 analogue in patients with diabetes. Diabetes is a major risk factor for development of atherosclerosis a cardiovascular disease characterised by invasion of lipid-laden macrophages into the artery wall inducing a chronic inflammatory state. Indeed an important athero-protective pathway reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is attenuated by inflammation. This study hypothesized that liraglutide may exert cardioprotective effects via modulation of the RCT pathway in vivo. Materials and methods: Apolipoprotein E knockout mice were fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD) for two weeks to induce atherosclerosis. Once-daily s.c. injections of either 300 mug/kg liraglutide (n = 16) or PBS (n = 11) were administered for a further six weeks during which time the diets were maintained. Low-fat diet-fed (LFD) mice acted as a control. As an in vivo method to track cholesterol movement along the RCT pathway 3H-cholesterol loaded J774macrophages were injected into the i.p. cavity and 3H-cholesterol levels in the plasma liver bile and faeces analysed. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on plasma samples to isolate the different lipoproteins. Results: Consistent with its weight loss effect liraglutide treatment decreased epididymal and subcutaneous adipose weight compared to HFHCD mice. Liraglutide had no significant effect on either plasma or liver 3H-cholesterol levels however it did significantly increase cholesterol clearance to faeces (p < 0.05) compared to HFHCD (Figure 1) - Mann Whitney test. Cholesterol mass on isolated VLDL fractions was significantly increased with HFHCD feeding compared to LFD (p < 0.001) an effect that was almost completely abrogated by liraglutide treatment (p < 0.01) - two-way ANOVA. Mass spectrometry was performed on isolated HDL fractions revealing significant changes in the HDL proteome in particular the complement system with liraglutide treatment (p < 0.05) - two sample t test. Conclusion: We conclude that liraglutide plays a role in promoting cholesterol clearance in a state of early atherosclerosis. Results also indicate that liraglutide treatment affects lipoprotein particles - integral components of RCT - with cholesterol and protein composition being altered in VLDL and HDL respectively. As most patients present with an advanced state of the disease rather than a developing state we are currently investigating the effect of liraglutide treatment in pre-established atherosclerosis.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for development of atherosclerosis a cardiovascular disease characterised by invasion of lipid-laden macrophages into the artery wall inducing a chronic inflammatory state. Indeed an important athero-protective pathway reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is attenuated by inflammation. This study hypothesized that liraglutide may exert cardioprotective effects via modulation of the RCT pathway in vivo. Materials and methods: Apolipoprotein E knockout mice were fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD) for two weeks to induce atherosclerosis. Once-daily s.c. injections of either 300 mug/kg liraglutide (n = 16) or PBS (n = 11) were administered for a further six weeks during which time the diets were maintained. Low-fat diet-fed (LFD) mice acted as a control. As an in vivo method to track cholesterol movement along the RCT pathway 3H-cholesterol loaded J774macrophages were injected into the i.p. cavity and 3H-cholesterol levels in the plasma liver bile and faeces analysed. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on plasma samples to isolate the different lipoproteins. Results: Consistent with its weight loss effect liraglutide treatment decreased epididymal and subcutaneous adipose weight compared to HFHCD mice. Liraglutide had no significant effect on either plasma or liver 3H-cholesterol levels however it did significantly increase cholesterol clearance to faeces (p < 0.05) compared to HFHCD (Figure 1) - Mann Whitney test. Cholesterol mass on isolated VLDL fractions was significantly increased with HFHCD feeding compared to LFD (p < 0.001) an effect that was almost completely abrogated by liraglutide treatment (p < 0.01) - two-way ANOVA. Mass spectrometry was performed on isolated HDL fractions revealing significant changes in the HDL proteome in particular the complement system with liraglutide treatment (p < 0.05) - two sample t test. Conclusion: We conclude that liraglutide plays a role in promoting cholesterol clearance in a state of early atherosclerosis. Results also indicate that liraglutide treatment affects lipoprotein particles - integral components of RCT - with cholesterol and protein composition being altered in VLDL and HDL respectively.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control (NC) diabetes model (DM) and exenatide treatment (ET) groups. Hematoxylin and eosin and alpha-actin immunohistochemical staining were used to detect changes in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect changes in KCa3.1 mRNA and protein levels respectively. Results: Aortic tissue staining in the DM group revealed an absence of smooth or integrated endothelium increased smooth muscle cell proliferation in the media smooth muscle hyperplasia disorganized smooth muscle cells and an increased number of collagen fibers relative to the NC and ET groups. KCa3.1 mRNA expression was higher in the DMgroup than in the NC and ET groups. Similarly the KCa3.1 protein level was higher in the DMgroup than in the NC and ET groups. The KCa3.1 protein level did not significantly differ between the ET and NC groups. Conclusions: Exenatide could inhibit the expression of the KCa3.1 channel in VSMCs of diabetic rats.Copyright © 2017 Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

Liraglutide improved vascular dysfunction in septic rats without improvement of inflammatory parameters such as nitrosyl-iron hemoglobin in whole blood or oxidative stress. Linagliptin and to a minor extend sitagliptin improved vascular dysfunction in septic rats with significant suppression of inflammatory parameters. Conclusion: The therapy of diabetic patients with linagliptin and liraglutide is well established. The results reported here on the improvement in the survival of septic animals could provide additional evidence for the potential use of these drugs in patients with septic shock.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000355890","SUPPL. 2","374","126","0008-6312",1323,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

In addition to enhancing insulin secretion peripheral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor stimulation has the added benefit of reducing this chylomicron overproduction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the presence of central GLP-1 receptors and GLP-1-producing neurons we assessed whether central GLP-1 exerts an integral layer of neuronal control during the production of these potentially atherogenic particles. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Postprandial production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was assessed in Syrian hamsters administered a single intracerebroventricular injection of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4. Intracerebroventricular exendin-4 reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-triglyceride and -apolipoprotein B48 accumulation relative to vehicle-treated controls. This was mirrored by intracerebroventricular MK-0626 an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-1 degradation and prevented by central exendin9-39 a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. The effects of intracerebroventricular exendin-4 were also lost during peripheral adrenergic receptor and central melanocortin-4 receptor inhibition achieved using intravenous propranolol and phentolamine and intracerebroventricular HS014 respectively. However central exendin9-39 did not preclude the effects of peripheral exendin-4 treatment on chylomicron output. CONCLUSIONS: Central GLP-1 is a novel regulator of chylomicron production via melanocortin-4 receptors. Our findings point to the relative importance of central accessibility of GLP-1-based therapies and compel further studies examining the status of this brain-gut axis in the development of diabetic dyslipidemia and chylomicron overproduction.","10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304873","5","1092-100","35","1079-5642",1511,"In_database","duplicate"

Given the presence of central GLP-1 receptors and GLP-1-producing neurons we assessed whether central GLP-1 exerts an integral layer of neuronal control during the production of these potentially atherogenic particles. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Postprandial production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was assessed in Syrian hamsters administered a single intracerebroventricular injection of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4. Intracerebroventricular exendin-4 reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-triglyceride and -apolipoprotein B48 accumulation relative to vehicle-treated controls. This was mirrored by intracerebroventricular MK-0626 an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-1 degradation and prevented by central exendin9-39 a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. The effects of intracerebroventricular exendin-4 were also lost during peripheral adrenergic receptor and central melanocortin-4 receptor inhibition achieved using intravenous propranolol and phentolamine and intracerebroventricular HS014 respectively. However central exendin9-39 did not preclude the effects of peripheral exendin-4 treatment on chylomicron output. CONCLUSIONS: Central GLP-1 is a novel regulator of chylomicron production via melanocortin-4 receptors. Our findings point to the relative importance of central accessibility of GLP-1-based therapies and compel further studies examining the status of this brain-gut axis in the development of diabetic dyslipidemia and chylomicron overproduction.","10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304873","5","1092-100","35","1079-5642",1683,"In_database","duplicate"

The recent rate at which these diseases have increased suggests that environmental and behavioural influences rather than genetic causes are triggering the present epidemic. A relationship has been established between adverse fetal and early-infant phases of life and the subsequent development of adult obesity and type 2 diabetes. Under this scenario we have performed a study focused on the relevance of the diet on early stages of life on the development of obesity and related metabolic disorders in adulthood. Materials and methods: The experiments were carried out in female Wistar rats aged of six months belonging to four diet groups: control (C) fed ad libitum with a standard chow diet undernourished (U) fed 35% of the daily control food intake control high-fat (CHF) and undernourished high-fat (UHF) both fed ad libitum with a high-fat diet (HFD) from weaning onwards. To evaluate the impact of the diet body weight and food intake were assessed weekly pancreatic and gut histology were studied and visceral fat pad was analysed. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed to evaluate insulin GLP-1 and GIP secretion and HOMA-IR values were calculated. Functionality of pancreatic islets was evaluated in vitro and gut incretin content was determined. Results: After weaning all rats gained weight when fed the HFD being UHF rats significantly more hyperphagic than CHF animals. Adiposity measures showed that HFD increased visceral fat accumulation and adipocyte size which were more marked in the UHF population. Although both populations under HFD developed glucose intolerance UHF rats displayed increased GIP and GLP-1 secretion during OGTT as compared to CHF showing enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo. Nevertheless glucose intolerance was more severe and not compensated in UHF rats suggesting insulin resistance as shown by HOMA-IR values. Surprisingly following HFD the in vitro response of beta cells was impaired not only in C rats but also in the U group. Moreover although islet size and beta-cell volume increased in both HFD-fed rats UHF rats showed fewer islets compared with their C counterparts. When addressing the effects of HFD on the enteroendocrine K and L cells we observed a greater impact in U rats. Thus whereas UHF rats showed a significant hyperplasia in both cell types as compared with U rats gut histology did not revealed significant differences between C and CHF rats. This result was corroborated by measuring gut GIP and GLP-1 content which were significantly increased in the UHF population. Conclusion: The results of this study stress the importance of the nutrition during early life and its relevance in the development of long-term metabolic disorders. Thus the greatest effects occur in offspring of food-restricted dams submitted to long-term HF feeding which developed a metabolic syndromelike phenotype characterised by increased adiposity glucose intolerance and an insulin resistance state highlighting the adverse consequences associated with catch-up growth.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-013-3012-z",NA,"S258-S259","1)","0012-186X",549,"In_database","unique"

Pre-clinical clinical and cardiovascular safety studies suggest patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors may be afforded cardiovascular benefits via either direct SGLT-2 inhibition or novel molecular mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects and associated mechanisms of action of Dapagliflozin (DG) in pre-clinical models of cardiovascular disease with specific reference to endothelial cell activation and vascular reactivity in order to evaluate potential anti-atherogenic and vasculoprotective effects of DG. Materials and methods: In-vitro studies utilised TNFalpha (10ng/ml) and hyperglycemia (10-30mM) stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) protein levels were determined from conditioned medium of TNFalpha or hyperglycemia stimulated DG treated (24h 1.0nM-5.0nM) HUVECs using ELISA assay. Real time qPCR was performed on mRNA extracted from TNFalpha stimulated DG treated (24h 1.0nM-5.0nM) HUVECs to evaluate NFkB expression levels. Abdominal aortic rings from 16 week-old C57Bl/6J mice maintained on a normal chow diet were utilised to evaluate direct vasorelaxation responses evoked by acute DG administration (1.0nM-10muM). Ex vivo endothelial-dependant vascular reactivity in response to acetylcholine (ACh) was examined using abdominal aortic rings from 7 monthold male apoE-/- mice on a high fat diet for 16 weeks that were treated with DG (1.0 mg/kg/day; drinking water) for the final 4 weeks. Results: DG treatment of TNFalpha or hyperglycemia stimulated HUVEC resulted in a significant attenuation of TNFalpha and hyperglycemiamediated induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein expression at 24h n=3-6 p<0.05. No significant effect of DG treatment on ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 protein expression was observed in unstimulated HUVEC. DG treatment of TNFalpha stimulated HUVEC also resulted in attenuation of induced NFkB expression n=3-4 p<0.05. Acute DG treatment caused a marked concentration-dependent and endothelium independent relaxation of pre-contracted mouse aortae compared to time controls (maximum relaxation 60.45 +/- 5.04%) n=5-9 p<0.0001. In addition there was a trend toward enhanced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation evoked by ACh in the setting of chronic DG administration n=3. Conclusion: DG inhibits ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in a human in-vitro model of endothelial cell activation an effect associated with attenuation of induced NFkB expression. DG potently induces acute direct vasorelaxation in mouse aortae whilst chronic in vivo administration of DG may afford improvements in endothelial dysfunction.

Real time qPCR was performed on mRNA extracted from TNFalpha stimulated DG treated (24h 1.0nM-5.0nM) HUVECs to evaluate NFkB expression levels. Abdominal aortic rings from 16 week-old C57Bl/6J mice maintained on a normal chow diet were utilised to evaluate direct vasorelaxation responses evoked by acute DG administration (1.0nM-10muM). Ex vivo endothelial-dependant vascular reactivity in response to acetylcholine (ACh) was examined using abdominal aortic rings from 7 monthold male apoE-/- mice on a high fat diet for 16 weeks that were treated with DG (1.0 mg/kg/day; drinking water) for the final 4 weeks. Results: DG treatment of TNFalpha or hyperglycemia stimulated HUVEC resulted in a significant attenuation of TNFalpha and hyperglycemiamediated induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein expression at 24h n=3-6 p<0.05. No significant effect of DG treatment on ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 protein expression was observed in unstimulated HUVEC. DG treatment of TNFalpha stimulated HUVEC also resulted in attenuation of induced NFkB expression n=3-4 p<0.05. Acute DG treatment caused a marked concentration-dependent and endothelium independent relaxation of pre-contracted mouse aortae compared to time controls (maximum relaxation 60.45 +/- 5.04%) n=5-9 p<0.0001. In addition there was a trend toward enhanced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation evoked by ACh in the setting of chronic DG administration n=3. Conclusion: DG inhibits ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in a human in-vitro model of endothelial cell activation an effect associated with attenuation of induced NFkB expression. DG potently induces acute direct vasorelaxation in mouse aortae whilst chronic in vivo administration of DG may afford improvements in endothelial dysfunction. Given the central role of vascular peptide expression and vasoreactivity in the atherogenic process formal in vivo characterisation of the effects of this agent on prevention of atherogenesis and plaque stabilisation are warranted.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-016-4046-9","1 Supplement 1","S353","59","0012-186X",1139,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"
"Gulati A.Briyal S.","Effect of liraglutide on apoptosis following cerebral ischemia",2013,"Critical Care Medicine","Introduction: Stroke is a common life-threatening neurological disorder that requires rapid diagnostic workup and immediate treatment. Our previous study indicates that rats receiving liraglutide showed marked reduction in infarct volume and neurological deficit following ischemic insult. Evidence suggests that GLP-1 is neuroprotective in both cell culture and animal models. Oxidative stress and apoptotic mechanisms have been implicated in brain ischemia; however the precise mechanism of action of liraglutide induced neuroprotection remains unknown. The objective of the present study is to determine the effect of liraglutide on oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways after ischemic injury. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g were used. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Rats were pretreated with either vehicle or liraglutide (50 mug/kg s.c.) for 14 days and thereafter subjected to cerebral ischemia. Twenty four hours after the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats were assessed for neurological deficit and motor function and subsequently sacrificed for estimation of infarct volume markers of oxidative stress (MDA GSH and SOD) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bax). Results: Non-diabetic and diabetic rats treated with vehicle showed significant (P<0.001) neurological deficit following cerebral ischemia compared to sham group. Liraglutide treatment produced a significant (P<0.001) reversal of neurological deficit compared to vehicle treated MCAO rats. Cerebral ischemia produced significant (P<0.0001) infarction in vehicle treated rats; however the infarct volume was markedly less in liraglutide treated rats. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain was significantly (P<0.001) increased following MCAO in vehicle treated group compared to sham. Liraglutide produced significant (P<0.001) protection as evident by attenuation of the raised MDA levels seen after MCAO rats. The levels of GSH and SOD were significantly (P<0.001) decreased following MCAO and increased following liraglutide. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased and pro-apoptotic protein Bax expression was increased in vehicle treated MCAO rats compared to sham.

However beyond the kidney and gut SGLT1 is expressed in other organs including the heart where it potentially assists GLUT-mediated glucose transport. Since cardiac myocytes become more reliant on glucose as a fuel source in the setting of stress this study sought to compare the effects of dual SGLT1/2 inhibition with selective SGLT2 inhibition in the diseased heart. METHODS: Hyperglycaemic Fischer F344 rats were randomized to receive either vehicle the dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor T-1095 or the selective SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. Animals were then further randomized to undergo sham surgery or ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Cardiac function was assessed prior to termination 4 weeks later that was followed by assessment of cardiac structure and expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 GLUT4 and SGLT1. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin and T-1095 induced glucosuria to a similar extent in both the control and myocardial infarction settings with similar effects on glycaemia. Neither dapagliflozin nor T-1095 had any demonstrable effect on cardiac function or structure in the control setting. Following myocardial infarction however significant (p < 0.05) differences were noted. When compared with vehicle or dapagliflozin-treated animals rats that received T-1095 displayed worse cardiac function as evidenced by (i) lower EF (ii) reduced dP/dt max (iii) impaired isovolumic relaxation in diastole (dP/dt min) (iv) prolongation of Tau and (v) increase in the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR). While vehicle and dapagliflozin-treated rats underwent hypertrophic changes following myocardial infarction this did not occur in animals that had received T-1095.

In addition to enhancing insulin secretion peripheral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor stimulation has the added benefit of reducing this chylomicron overproduction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the presence of central GLP-1 receptors and GLP-1-producing neurons we assessed whether central GLP-1 exerts an integral layer of neuronal control during the production of these potentially atherogenic particles. Approach and Results - Postprandial production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was assessed in Syrian hamsters administered a single intracerebroventricular injection of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4. Intracerebroventricular exendin-4 reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-triglyceride and -apolipoprotein B48 accumulation relative to vehicle-treated controls. This was mirrored by intracerebroventricular MK-0626 an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-1 degradation and prevented by central exendin9-39 a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. The effects of intracerebroventricular exendin-4 were also lost during peripheral adrenergic receptor and central melanocortin-4 receptor inhibition achieved using intravenous propranolol and phentolamine and intracerebroventricular HS014 respectively. However central exendin9-39 did not preclude the effects of peripheral exendin-4 treatment on chylomicron output. Conclusions - Central GLP-1 is a novel regulator of chylomicron production via melanocortin-4 receptors. Our findings point to the relative importance of central accessibility of GLP-1-based therapies and compel further studies examining the status of this brain-gut axis in the development of diabetic dyslipidemia and chylomicron overproduction.Copyright © 2015 American Heart Association Inc.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304873","5","1092-1100","35","1079-5642

Mononuclear cell (MNC) homing in HHT-1 is impaired. We hypothesize whether or not homing and tissue repair after myocardial infarction (MI) can be improved by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibition. DPP4 inactivates SDF-1alpha thereby inhibiting recruitment of CXCR4 expressing cells. Previous research showed that the pretreatment of MNC with DPP4 inhibitors improved the homing towards the infarcted myocardium. This study aims to improve homing and cardiac function in a mouse model for HHT-1 by DPP4 inhibition. Myocardial infarction (MI) was surgically induced in wildtype and endoglin heterozygous mice by the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). This was followed by daily injection of DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A in the first 5 days after MI to study acute phase homing in vivo. The effect on cardiac function was studied by echography. Treatment of wildtype mice with DPP4 inhibitor improved cardiac function (endocardial ejection fraction). However the same treatment in endoglin heterozygous mice showed no effect on cardiac function. We hypothesize that despite of increased homing of MNC in these mice it does not have a beneficial effect on tissue repair. By isolation of the MNCs from blood samples via tail vein cuts and within tissue by cardiac digestion we were able to study cell type and activation of leukocytes macrophages and levels of DPP4 by using flow cytometry. This will give us information about the type and amount of leukocytes and macrophages recruited to the blood and site of tissue damage to see what can explain the difference between wildtype and endoglin heterozygous mice. Furthermore hearts were sectioned for immune-histochemistry to estimate exact infarct size and number of capillaries formed. Our results suggest that DPP4 inhibition improves homing of monocyte and progenitor cells towards damaged tissues in wildtype mice and that it improves cardiac function. However in a mouse model for HHT-1 the improved homing does not have beneficial effects. More insight into the function of DPP4 on homing is needed to gain insight to improve tissue repair.

METHODS: Forty-eight 5-week-old male ApoE (-/-) mice were fed a western diet for 20 weeks and divided into four groups: control (saline 154 mmol/l NaCl) glimepiride 0.1 mg/kg empagliflozin 1 mg/kg and empagliflozin 3 mg/kg (n = 12/group).

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs)/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) interaction serves a key role in the development of diabetic vascular complications. The present study examined whether the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide can ameliorate atherogenesis via inhibiting AGEs-induced RAGE expression. Male ApoE-/- mice (age 10 weeks) were divided into control GLP-1 AGEs and AGEs+GLP-1 group. All mice were fed a high-fat diet. The AGEs and AGEs+GLP-1 groups were treated with intraperitoneal injection of AGEs (30 mg/kg/day). The GLP-1 and AGEs+GLP-1 groups were treated with subcutaneous injections of liraglutide (0.4 mg/kg/day). After 9 weeks blood was drawn and the aortas were rapidly procured. The serum levels of AGEs soluble RAGE (sRAGE) stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) total cholesterol and triacylglycerol were measured. Atherosclerotic plaque area was determined by Sudan IV staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RAGE were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting respectively. The results demonstrated that AGEs treatment increased serum AGEs levels increased the expression of RAGE in the aorta and aggravated atherosclerotic lesions compared with the control. Liraglutide treatment reduced serum AGEs levels reduced the expression of RAGE in aorta and relieved atherosclerotic lesions compared with the control. In conclusion these data suggested that liraglutide serves an anti-atherosclerotic effect via inhibiting AGEs-induced RAGE expression in ApoE-/- mice.

Objectives: Given that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) regulates several intracellular signaling pathways associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) metabolism we investigated the role of DPP4 in stress-related vascular senescence and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE ) mice with a special focus on the pleiotropic effect of adiponectin (APN). Methods: ApoE mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet were randomly assigned to one of non-stress and immobilized stress groups for 12 weeks (n=15 for each group). Moreover mice (n=) fed HF diet were divided to 1 of 2 groups and administered vehicle or DPP4 inhibitor anaglipitin (60 mg/kg/day) for 12-weeks under stress conditions (n= 14 for each group). Results: Quantitative data revealed that chronic stress accelerated vascular senescence and atherosclerotic plaque growth at the aortic root and the thoracic aortas. Stressed mice had increased levels of plasma DPP4 activity and decreased levels of plasma GLP-1 and APN and adipose APN expression. Stress increased plaque microphage infiltration neovessel density and elastin fragmentation lessened the plaque collagen content and increased the levels of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) TLR4 C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 cathepsins S and K osteopontin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and gp91phox mRNAs and/or proteins. Stressed aortas had also increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 activities.

In vitro the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide stimulated APN expression in 3T3 cells. Conclusions: These results indicate that the DPP4 inhibition-mediated benefits are likely attributable at least in part to attenuation of plaque inflammation oxidative stress and proteolysis associated with GLP-1-mediated APN production in ApoE mice under stress.

"Heymans S.Cuijpers I.Papageorgiou A. P.Carai P.Klein T.","DPP4 inhibition by linagliptin prevents the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the metabolic syndrome ZSF1 rats",2017,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common HF phenotype. HFpEF is highly prevalent in elderly women and frequently accompanied by a cluster of comorbidities including obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus arterial hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) renal insufficiencies and anaemia. Currently the pathophysiology underlying HFpEF is not fully elucidated resulting in the absence of prevention and treatment strategies. As the anti-diabetic drug Linagliptin a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor has been shown to have cardioprotective effects (e.g. improvement of diastolic dysfunction and cardiac inflammation) we hypothesized that Linagliptin could protect against HFpEF development (hypertrophy inflammation fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction) in a chronic metabolic risk-induced HFpEF animal model. Materials and methods: Sixteen weeks old obese ZSF-1 rats received Linagliptin supplemented diet (83 mg/kg; n=7) or placebo chow (n=7) for four weeks while hypertensive non-diabetic Lean ZSF-1 rats which do not develop HFpEF served as non-diseased controls (n=5). Results: Linagliptin significantly reduced plasma DPP4 activity by 81.9% and elevated active glucagon-like peptide 1 (aGLP1; inhibited by DPP4) by 271.3% in obese ZSF1 rats proving its therapeutic potential. In line Linagliptin significantly diminished the fasting glucose levels by 33.5% in diabetic obese ZSF1 rats. Importantly Linagliptin decreased cardiac hypertrophy as reflected by a significantly diminished left ventricular weight to tibia length (-9%) and a trend towards reduced cardiomyocyte size (-16.2%; p=0.05) in obese ZSF1 rats. Moreover Linagliptin improved left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as reflected by a 24.1% reduction in deceleration time an indicator of left ventricular stiffness in obese ZSF1 rats. In addition to reducing cardiac hypertrophy and improving diastolic function Linagliptin significantly cardiac leukocyte infiltration while inducing a trend towards reduced systemic (pro-inflammatory) monocyte levels (-33.9%; p=0.08) in obese ZSF1 rats suggesting that Linagliptin has an anti-inflammatory effect both systemic and cardiac. Furthermore Linagliptin significantly reduced perivascular fibrosis (- 27.7%) and elevated the coronary capillary density (+52.8%) in obese ZSF1 rats proposing a vascular effect.

P.Carai P.Klein T.","DPP4 inhibition by linagliptin prevents the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the metabolic syndrome ZSF1 rats",2017,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common HF phenotype. HFpEF is highly prevalent in elderly women and frequently accompanied by a cluster of comorbidities including obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus arterial hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) renal insufficiencies and anaemia. Currently the pathophysiology underlying HFpEF is not fully elucidated resulting in the absence of prevention and treatment strategies. As the anti-diabetic drug Linagliptin a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor has been shown to have cardioprotective effects (e.g. improvement of diastolic dysfunction and cardiac inflammation) we hypothesized that Linagliptin could protect against HFpEF development (hypertrophy inflammation fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction) in a chronic metabolic risk-induced HFpEF animal model. Materials and methods: Sixteen weeks old obese ZSF-1 rats received Linagliptin supplemented diet (83 mg/kg; n=7) or placebo chow (n=7) for four weeks while hypertensive non-diabetic Lean ZSF-1 rats which do not develop HFpEF served as non-diseased controls (n=5). Results: Linagliptin significantly reduced plasma DPP4 activity by 81.9% and elevated active glucagon-like peptide 1 (aGLP1; inhibited by DPP4) by 271.3% in obese ZSF1 rats proving its therapeutic potential. In line Linagliptin significantly diminished the fasting glucose levels by 33.5% in diabetic obese ZSF1 rats. Importantly Linagliptin decreased cardiac hypertrophy as reflected by a significantly diminished left ventricular weight to tibia length (-9%) and a trend towards reduced cardiomyocyte size (-16.2%; p=0.05) in obese ZSF1 rats. Moreover Linagliptin improved left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as reflected by a 24.1% reduction in deceleration time an indicator of left ventricular stiffness in obese ZSF1 rats. In addition to reducing cardiac hypertrophy and improving diastolic function Linagliptin significantly cardiac leukocyte infiltration while inducing a trend towards reduced systemic (pro-inflammatory) monocyte levels (-33.9%; p=0.08) in obese ZSF1 rats suggesting that Linagliptin has an anti-inflammatory effect both systemic and cardiac. Furthermore Linagliptin significantly reduced perivascular fibrosis (- 27.7%) and elevated the coronary capillary density (+52.8%) in obese ZSF1 rats proposing a vascular effect. In addition Linagliptin ameliorated the MetS phenotype as reflected by significantly diminished total body weight (-11.5%) %) spleen (-18.1%) kidney (-19.7%) liver (-34.9%) weight to tibia length and plasma triglycerides (-51.8%) and non-HDL cholesterol levels (-31.2%) while elevating plasma HDL levels (+75.0%) in obese ZSF1 rats.

In our lab empagliflozin and dapagliflozin curbed inflammation and oxidant stress induced by stearic acid (SA) in human myeloid angiogenic cells (MAC; elsewhere named endothelial progenitor cells). We asked the question whether cell bioenergetics may be involved in the effects exerted by SA and/or SGLT2-inhibitors in MAC which are thought to play major roles in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. Aim of the study was to assess in human MAC whether: 1. SA-induced increases in inflammation and oxidant stress are accompanied by bioenergetic alterations; 2. empagliflozin anti-lipotoxic action is concomitant with coherent changes in bioenergetic metabolism. Materials and methods: MAC were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and incubated in the presence/absence of SA (100 muM) for 3 hours with/without empagliflozin (EMPA 100 muM). Respiration (O2 consumption rate: VO2) and glycolysis (GLYC; measured as extracellular acidification rate) were recorded in realtime by Seahorse technology (XFp Extracellular Flux Analyzer Agilent). Basal and maximal VO2 ATP-linked and nonmitochondrial respiration and spare respiratory capacity were quantified by serially adding oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor) FCCP (protonophore) and rotenone/antimycin A (inhibitors of complex I and III of electron transport chain) into the culture medium according to a well established protocol. All parameters were adjusted for the number of viable cells. Results: SA at the concentration (100 muM) causing inflammation and increased oxidant stress extensively altered cell bioenergetics of human MAC with overall reductions both in basal/maximal VO2 ATP production and spare respiratory capacity (all p < 0.05 or less vs control) all pointing to mitochondrial dysfunction and in GLYC (p < 0.05) indicating no induction of Warburg effect. EMPA at the concentration counteracting SA-induced lipotoxicity both alone and in the presence of SA caused alterations in cell bioenergetics quite similar to those induced by SA alone (p < 0.05 or less vs control). Conclusion: In human MAC: 1. SA induces extensive alterations in cell bioenergetics concomitantly with increase in inflammation and oxidant stress; 2. EMPA may inhibit TCA cycle/mitochondrial respiration extending a previous observation made with dapagliflozin in muscle biopsies and suggesting a potential class effect; 3. the protective effect of EMPAagainst SA-induced lipotoxicity is unlikely to be mediated through bioenergetic metabolism.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-018-4693-0","Suppl 1","S57","61 (Supplement 1)","1432-0428",238,"In_database","unique"
"Farr S. L.Baker C.Naples M.Adeli K.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 reduces intestinal lipid availability and lipoprotein production via a gut-brain axis",2013,"Diabetes","Postprandial dyslipidemia is a component of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistant states and involves the intestinal overproduction of atherogenic chylomicron (CM) particles. Recent evidence indicates that the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) can reduce CM secretion and that its production is impaired with insulin resistance. There is evidence that GLP-1 may hinder hepatic lipoprotein assembly by reducing tissue lipid availability; however the mechanism of action of GLP-1 on intestinal CM production and whether these effects are mediated centrally remains unclear. To test this chow-fed hamsters were given an oral fat load containing 3H-triolein and an intraperitoneal injection of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4 (Ex4 5nmol/kg) (Byetta). Postprandial lipid and apoB48 accumulation was assessed over 8 h in the triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction of the plasma and the distribution of 3H between jejunal tissue and luminal contents was assessed. We found that Ex4 significantly lowered TRL-TG cholesterol and apoB48 levels; these effects remained even 8 h post fat load. Jejunum from Ex4-treated hamsters displayed reduced TG and 3H levels at 2 h with heightened 3H levels in jejunal contents suggesting fat malabsorption. By 6 h jejunal activity of microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP) was reduced with Ex4 treatment consistent with the notion of limited TG availability.

Recently the anti-diabetic hormone glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-1) has gained attention not only as an insulin secretagogue but also as a modulator of intestinal lipoprotein metabolism in the periphery. GLP-1 can additionally be produced within the brain to regulate neuronal activity in regions like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and through sympathetic pathways GLP-1 has been shown to modulate peripheral lipid metabolism. Here we investigated the involvement of both peripheral and central GLP-1 in regulating intestinal chylomicron production. Materials and methods: Healthy hamsters received an oral gavage of olive oil followed by an acute intraperitoneal (IP) or intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4 (5nmol/kg and 250ng respectively) or vehicle.

This study was repeated with 3mug ICV MK-0626 an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-1 degradation in the presence of absence of the GLP-1R antagonist exendin9-39. To characterize the central pathways of GLP-1 action the effects of ICV exendin-4 on TRL production were assessed during ICV melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) antagonism and in the presence or absence of alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers given intravenously. Results: Both IP and ICV exendin-4 treatment induced prolonged reductions in the rate of TRL-TG accumulation (IP 72% p<0.05 and ICV 56.5% p<0.01). A similar trend was seen in apoB48 accumulation.

Our study aimed to elucidate this mechanism in the absence of confounding changes in gastric emptying. Hamsters received an intraduodenal infusion of olive oil to bypass the stomach preceded by a single intraperitoneal injection of exendin-4 or vehicle and an intravenous infusion of triton to prevent lipoprotein clearance. Triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins were then fractionated from plasma samples taken over a 4 h period and were measured for TG accumulation and levels of apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) which reflect chylomicron particle number. Exendin-4 treatment had no effect of plasma or TRL TG levels but significantly reduced 4 h apoB48 levels. To assess whether this resulted from a change in particle size 4 h plasma samples underwent lipoprotein fractionation by FPLC. Exendin- 4 was found to increase lipoprotein particle size (TG loading) despite lowering the overall number of chylomicrons present.

Incretin-based therapies are in increasing clinical use for treating hyperglycemia but recent evidence emphasizes their ability to improve lipoprotein abnormalities. This is significant as heightened postprandial chylomicron levels during insulin resistance contribute to atherogenic diabetic dyslipidemia. This review summarises the evidence supporting a beneficial effect of incretin-based therapies on diabetic dyslipidemia through modulation of intestinal lipoprotein metabolism. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical and clinical trials have involved administering dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists to healthy and insulin-resistant individuals. Results indicate that enhancing GLP-1R signalling decreases postprandial apoB48-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. These effects may be direct or may be secondary to reduced gastric emptying increased insulin secretion or enhanced chylomicron clearance. SUMMARY: Enhancing GLP-1R activity improves intestinal lipoprotein metabolism. GLP-1-mediated control of postprandial chylomicron production may be lost in type 2 diabetes in which the incretin response is impaired and in which associated dyslipidemia involves an excess of atherogenic chylomicron remnants.

In animal experiments local and remote ischemic pre- and postconditioning not only reduce infarct size but also these manifestations of coronary vascular injury as do drugs which recruit signal transduction steps of conditioning.

DPP-4i showed an anti-atherosclerotic effect in Apoe (-/-) mice mainly through the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypepide. However the dual incretin receptor antagonists partially attenuated the suppressive effect of DPP-4i on atherosclerosis in diabetic Apoe (-/-) mice suggesting an incretin-independent mechanism. Exendin-4 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypepide elicited cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced gene expression of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1beta interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in U937 human monocytes. This suppressive effect however was attenuated by an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase and mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate or forskolin. DPP-4i substantially suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines without affecting cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation or cell proliferation. DPP-4i more strongly suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced gene expression of inflammatory molecules than incretins most likely through inactivation of CD26. Glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypepide suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced macrophage foam cell formation in a receptor-dependent manner which was associated with the downregulation of acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase-1 and CD36 as well as the up-regulation of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1.

Variable successes in generating glucose-responsive insulin-producing beta-like cells from pluripotent and differentiated cells have been reported. We report on genetic reprogramming of highly expandable patient-derived human gallbladder cells (GBCs) to produce insulin for autologous transplant. Using feeder-free and feeder-type culture methods we expanded GBCs in vitro in the order of 10^8 total cells after 4 passages starting from 10^4 GBCs. Cultures can be maintained for at least 15 passages albeit with slowdown in growth. Transcriptome profiling revealed GBCs to be deficient in factors important for beta-cell development specification and maintenance such as NEUROG3 MAFA NKX6-1 NKX2-2 PAX4 PAX6 NEUROD1 INSM1 RFX6 GCK and INS. MNX1 and PDX1 are moderately expressed in cultures but at significantly lower levels found in beta-cells. Viral transduction of PDX1 MAFA and NEUROG3 (PNM) induced expression of INS at 1/10000th compared to that of human islet cells. Transduced GBCs began to show morphological changes from a monolayer into 3D clusters as early as 2 days after transduction. Retinoic acid GLP-1 FGF10 DAPT T3 Alk5 inhibitor and B27 in the reprogramming medium and the addition of PAX6 to PNM transduction highly improved both INS and NKX6-1 induction reaching 10% of islet cells. These reprogrammed GBCs also express high levels of NEUROD1 NKX2- 2 RFX6 PAX4 MAFB HOPX SST GHRL CHGA TMEM27 SYP KCNJ11 and ABCC8 comparable to islet cells. Average transduction efficiency was 50% yielding 9% C-peptide+ cells by immunostaining. Cellular C-peptide content was equivalent to 0.3% of that of purified beta-cells. At best we observed 5-fold increase in C-peptide concentration in response to high glucose. We further enriched for INS+ reprogrammed GBCs using a cell surface mAb (HPi1) shown to isolate human pancreatic islet cells. Immunolabeling showed that reprogramming significantly increased the percentage of Hpi1+ GBCs. RT-qPCR of Hpi1+ GBCs showed greater than 1000-fold enrichment in gene expression of INS NKX6-1 and PCSK1 compared to Hpi1- cells. Likewise we observed greater than 100-fold enrichment for NEUROD1 SST GHRL and RFX6. In addition we saw significant increase in reprogramming efficiency by adding an isoxazole to the reprogramming medium resulting to 10-fold higher INS expression 2.5-fold increase in the frequency of C-peptide+ cells and significant drop in SST and GHRL expression. Reprogrammed GBCs can engraft survive and produce C-peptide for at least 2 weeks in under the kidney capsule mammary fat pad and dorsal subcutaneous fat in NSG mice. Transplant experiments in diabetic mice are ongoing. In summary we have transdifferentiated patient-derived adult GBCs into beta-like cells ex vivo thus showing that GBCs are potential replacement sources of autologous insulinproducing cells.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mt.2015.74",NA,"S109-S110","1)","1525-0016",459,"In_database","unique"

Using feeder-free and feeder-type culture methods we expanded GBCs in vitro in the order of 10^8 total cells after 4 passages starting from 10^4 GBCs. Cultures can be maintained for at least 15 passages albeit with slowdown in growth. Transcriptome profiling revealed GBCs to be deficient in factors important for beta-cell development specification and maintenance such as NEUROG3 MAFA NKX6-1 NKX2-2 PAX4 PAX6 NEUROD1 INSM1 RFX6 GCK and INS. MNX1 and PDX1 are moderately expressed in cultures but at significantly lower levels found in beta-cells. Viral transduction of PDX1 MAFA and NEUROG3 (PNM) induced expression of INS at 1/10000th compared to that of human islet cells. Transduced GBCs began to show morphological changes from a monolayer into 3D clusters as early as 2 days after transduction. Retinoic acid GLP-1 FGF10 DAPT T3 Alk5 inhibitor and B27 in the reprogramming medium and the addition of PAX6 to PNM transduction highly improved both INS and NKX6-1 induction reaching 10% of islet cells. These reprogrammed GBCs also express high levels of NEUROD1 NKX2- 2 RFX6 PAX4 MAFB HOPX SST GHRL CHGA TMEM27 SYP KCNJ11 and ABCC8 comparable to islet cells. Average transduction efficiency was 50% yielding 9% C-peptide+ cells by immunostaining. Cellular C-peptide content was equivalent to 0.3% of that of purified beta-cells. At best we observed 5-fold increase in C-peptide concentration in response to high glucose. We further enriched for INS+ reprogrammed GBCs using a cell surface mAb (HPi1) shown to isolate human pancreatic islet cells. Immunolabeling showed that reprogramming significantly increased the percentage of Hpi1+ GBCs. RT-qPCR of Hpi1+ GBCs showed greater than 1000-fold enrichment in gene expression of INS NKX6-1 and PCSK1 compared to Hpi1- cells. Likewise we observed greater than 100-fold enrichment for NEUROD1 SST GHRL and RFX6. In addition we saw significant increase in reprogramming efficiency by adding an isoxazole to the reprogramming medium resulting to 10-fold higher INS expression 2.5-fold increase in the frequency of C-peptide+ cells and significant drop in SST and GHRL expression. Reprogrammed GBCs can engraft survive and produce C-peptide for at least 2 weeks in under the kidney capsule mammary fat pad and dorsal subcutaneous fat in NSG mice. Transplant experiments in diabetic mice are ongoing. In summary we have transdifferentiated patient-derived adult GBCs into beta-like cells ex vivo thus showing that GBCs are potential replacement sources of autologous insulinproducing cells.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mt.2015.74","SUPPL. 1","S109-S110","23","1525-0016",1202,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Materials and methods: Wild-type C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with Lir to examine phenotypic shifts. Alongside this a high-fat (60%) high-cholesterol (1%) diet (HFHCD) was fed to ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice for 8-12 weeks to induce atherosclerotic disease. Mice received 300 mug/kg Lir daily during weeks 3-8 to investigate disease progression and weeks 8-12 to examine regression of established disease. En face analysis was employed to quantify atherosclerotic lesions in aortae from ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Human atherosclerotic plaques and serum from patients pre- and post-Lir treatment were also investigated. Gene expression analysis ELISA and flow cytometry were used to interrogate inflammatory mediators. Results: Lir halted early disease progression in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (HFHCD 2.03 +/- 0.18% vs HFHCD+Lir 1.36 +/- 0.28% *p < 0.05). This result mirrored significant decreases in inflammatoryM1 (TNF-alpha HFHCD 2.50 +/- 0.38 vs HFHCD+Lir 0.15 +/- 0.01 **p < 0.01) and increases in antiinflammatory M2 gene expression (IL-10 HFHCD 0.84 +/- 0.07 vs HFHCD+Lir 2.46 +/- 0.32 **p < 0.01) in BMDMs. Pro-inflammatory monocytes were also markedly reduced (HFHCD 59.27 +/- 2.97 vs HFHCD+Lir 16.79 +/- 4.47 **p < 0.01). Pro-resolvingM2 BMDMs were significantly elevated (HFHCD 37.45 +/- 2.49% vs HFHCD+Lir 73.36 +/- 3.84% *p < 0.05). Importantly Lir induced regression of pre-established atherosclerotic lesions (HFHCD 6.81 +/- 0.33% vs HFHCD+Lir 4.02 +/- 0.38% ***p < 0.001) decreased M1 (HFHCD 18.07 +/- 3.32% vs HFHCD+Lir 5.67 +/- 1.71% **p < 0.01) and increased M2 populations (HFHCD 71.32 +/- 13.04% vs HFHCD+Lir 94.24 +/- 1.71% **p < 0.01). DCs from lymph nodes of Lir-treated mice were also elevated (HFHCD 5.63e5 +/- 1.05e5 vs HFHCD+Lir 1.37e7 +/- 1.14e7 ns p = 0.0952) during regression. Serum samples from patients pre- and post-Lir treatment resulted in significant reductions of pro-atherogenic sCD163 (Pre-Lir 3.18 +/- 0.30 vs Post-Lir 2.69 +/- 0.17 ***p < 0.001) and atherosclerotic plaques showed reduced TNF-alpha secretion (PBS 135.10 +/- 67.48 vs Lir 61.32 +/- 37.55 ns p = 0.0927).

The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) agonists currently emerging as antidiabetic medications have shown promising cardiovascular effects and are speculated to have cardioprotective potentials. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have altered metabolism in the heart with reduced glycolysis and increased beta oxidation of free fatty acids. Thus a mechanism of enhancing myocardial energetic efficiency by increasing glucose availability and utilization and thereby reducing beta oxidation and increasing cardioprotection may exist. Of interest GLP-1 seems to increase myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) in dogs. Thus our aim was to assess the effects of GLP-1r activation on glucose metabolism and blood flow in hearts of subjects with T2DM. Materials and methods: We conducted a randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled cross-over study including eight type 2 diabetes patients all males insulin naive and without coronary artery disease. Positron emission tomography was used to determine the effect of GLP-1 on myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) during a pituitary-pancreatic hyperglycemic clamp (plasma glucose 90 mmol/l) with <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia and <sup>18</sup>fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) as tracers.

Results: While GLPr activation did not affect MGU (013 +/- 007 and 015 +/- 005 micromol/g/min P=066) GLP-1r activation increased MBF from 073 +/- 0094 to 085 +/- 0091 ml/g/min p=00056.

"Geng G.Liu X.","Effect of Sitagliptin on the anti-atherogenic M2 macrophage polarization",2016,"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a new class of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs that can improve blood glucose by reducing inactivation of incretins. Studies have shown that these drugs can exert anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice. However the roles of DPP-4 inhibitors in polarization of macrophages have not been well studied. Therefore we investigated the effects of DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin on macrophage polarization. Monocyte-derived macrophages were established from human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS 20 ng/ml) stimulation was used to initiate inflammatory conditions. We found that Sitagliptin could induce macrophage polarization towards M2 cells through activating STAT6. Sitagliptin treatment significantly up-regulated the specific markers of M2 macrophage expression including the scavenger receptor CD163 and the macrophage mannose receptor CD206. Furthermore pre-treatment of macrophages with Sitagliptin for 24 h also resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA levels of IL-10 TGF-beta and Arg-1 which are markers related to M2 macrophages while the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha IL-6 and iNOS were decreased. An increase in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta was also observed.

"Geng G.Liu X.","Effect of Sitagliptin on the anti-atherogenic M2 macrophage polarization",2016,"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a new class of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs that can improve blood glucose by reducing inactivation of incretins. Studies have shown that these drugs can exert anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice. However the roles of DPP-4 inhibitors in polarization of macrophages have not been well studied. Therefore we investigated the effects of DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin on macrophage polarization. Monocyte-derived macrophages were established from human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS 20 ng/ml) stimulation was used to initiate inflammatory conditions. We found that Sitagliptin could induce macrophage polarization towards M2 cells through activating STAT6. Sitagliptin treatment significantly up-regulated the specific markers of M2 macrophage expression including the scavenger receptor CD163 and the macrophage mannose receptor CD206. Furthermore pre-treatment of macrophages with Sitagliptin for 24 h also resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA levels of IL-10 TGF-beta and Arg-1 which are markers related to M2 macrophages while the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha IL-6 and iNOS were decreased. An increase in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta was also observed. Moreover a reduction in oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced lipid accumulation was observed in Sitagliptin-treated M2 macrophages confirming the anti-atherogenic effect of DPP-4 inhibitor. In conclusion the results of present study showed that Sitagliptin-induced M2 polarization of macrophages could be mediated by STAT6 signalling which facilitated its anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties.Copyright © 2016 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Emerging endoscopic technologies can reproduce some of the anatomical alterations of bariatric surgery. Intragastric balloons (IGB) reduce effective gastric volume and delay gastric emptying; endoscopic implantation of a duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve (DJS) liner allows food to bypass the proximal intestine potentially stimulating the enteroinsular system to enhance glycemic control. Our aim was to study the feasibility safety efficacy and physiological alterations of combining IGB and DJS for the treatment of obesity and impaired glycemic control. Methods: Five female Ossabaw mini-pigs were fed high-energy modified fructose-based atherogenic diet until they developed obesity. Pigs were randomly selected to receive IGB (Orbera Apollo Endosurgery Austin Tx) or DJS (Endobarrier GI Dynamics Lexington MA) either alone or in sequence. Caloric intake was tightly regulated and the pigs were housed individually. The pigs were followed for 29 weeks [median range 25-46] with weekly weight recordings. Fasting and post-prandial blood were drawn through a central venous catheter at 3 times: before any intervention (serving as the control) 1 month after 1st device insertion and 1 month following the combination. Total ghrelin adiponectin leptin glucose insulin PYY GLP-1 HDL LDL triglycerides ALT and GGT were measured. Area under the curve (AUC) for each analyte was estimated using the trapezoidal method. Results: Rates of weight gain were significantly lower with the IGB (1+/-1.4kg/wk p=0.02) DJS (0.75+/-2.27kg/wk p=0.06) or Combination (0.63+/-1.3kg/wk p=0.0007) compared to control 1.96+/-2.17kg/wk) (figure 1). The rates of weight gain were not significantly different with the combination devices compared to each individually (p=0.25) and were similar regardless of the sequence of device insertion (p=0.9) (Figure 2). IGB insertion was associated with a decrease in AUC ghrelin (530.59pg/ml P=0.02) compared to control (1334 pg/ ml) (p=0.02).

We previously showed that VNS with high-frequency (10 Hz) electrical impulses decreased food intake and body weight in rats. In the present study we investigated the effect of VNS on the serum lipid concentrations feeding behavior and appetite in rats fed a high-fat diet. The levels of appetite-regulating peptides were also assessed. Methods: Adult male rats were implanted with a microstimulator (MS) and fed a high-fat diet (42 days 10 Hz). The left vagus nerve was stimulated sub-diaphragmatically with electrical pulses generated by the MS. Daily food intake and body weight as well as total serum cholesterol triglycerides LDL and HDL lipoproteins levels were measured. Adipose tissue content was evaluated by weighing epididymal fat pads while aortic and hepatic fragments were taken for routine histological examination. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretin glucose- dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) serum concentrations were measured by ELISA method. Results: Chronic VNS significantly decreased food intake body weight gain and epididymal fat pad weight. VNS also lowered the total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Furthermore hepatic steatosis and discrete changes evoked by high-fat diet in aortic wall were reduced following VNS. The serum concentrations of CRF secretin and GIP were elevated NPY levels were decreased and GLP-1 levels remained unchanged after VNS. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that chronic electrical VNS exerts anorexigenic effects on food intake and body weight gain reducing body fat accumulation and lowering the blood concentration of lipids thus may be hypothetically useful for diet-induced obesity management.

However beyond the kidney and gut SGLT1 is expressed in a range of other organs including the heart where it potentially assists GLUTmediated glucose transport. Since cardiac myocytes become more reliant on glucose as a fuel source in the setting of stress the present study sought to compare the effects of dual SGLT1/2 inhibition with selective SGLT2 inhibition in the normal and diseased heart. Materials and methods: Hyperglycaemic (plasma glucose 10-15 mmol/l) Fischer F344 rats were randomized to receive either vehicle the dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor T-1095 (150 mg/kg/d p.o.) or the selective SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg/d p.o.). Animals were then further randomized to undergo sham surgery or ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery to induce infarction of the left ventricle (LV). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and conductance catheterisation just prior to termination 4 weeks later that was followed by assessment of cardiac structure. Results: Dapagliflozin and T-1095 induced glucosuria to a similar extent in both the control and myocardial infarction settings with similar effects on glycaemia as assessed by serum fructosamine. Neither dapagliflozin nor T-1095 had any demonstrable effect on cardiac function or structure in the control setting. Following myocardial infarction however significant (p<0.05) differences were noted. When compared with vehicle or dapagliflozin-treated animals rats that received T-1095 displayed worse cardiac function in both systole and diastole as evidenced by (i) lower ejection fraction (ii) reduced maximal rate of LV pressure rise in early systole (dP/dtmax) (iii) impaired isovolumic relaxation in diastole (dP/dt min) (iv) prolongation of the early energy-dependent phase of relaxation in diastole (Tau) and (v) reduced passive LV compliance as measured by an increase in the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR). While vehicle and dapagliflozin-treated rats underwent hypertrophic changes following myocardial infarction this did not occur in animals that had received T-1095 where LV mass and cardiac myocyte crosssectional area were similar to those of control uninfarcted rats. Following myocardial infarction lung weight a marker of interstitial/ alveolar oedema was also higher in T-1095 treated rats than in those animals that had received either vehicle of dapagliflozin. Conclusion: Dual SGLT1/2 inhibition with T-1095 prevented the hypertrophic response following experimental myocardial infarction in the rat with adverse consequences on both systolic and diastolic function. These findings suggest that the heart may be more reliant on SGLT1-mediated glucose transport in the disease setting.

In vivo effects of an acute GSPE treatment (1 g GSPE/kg bw) for 1 hour on intestinal and plasmatic DPP4 activity were analysed on Wistar rats. Rats treated with 1 mg Vildagliptin/kg bw for 1 hour were used as positive control. We measured DPP4 activity by colorimetric determination of product (H-Gly-Pro-pNA 0.2 mM Bachem) and glucose concentrations were assayed using and enzymatic colorimetric kit (GOD-PAD method from QCA). Intestinal DPP4 activity was inhibited in rats treated with GSPE but no effects were found in DPP4 plasma activity. The effects of that treatment on glucose levels were evaluated after a glucose load (2 g Glucose/kg bw for 20 min). We found a lower increase on plasma glucose after GSPE treatment a similar pattern than that of Vildagliptin. In conclusion an acute dose of GSPE can limit the acute glucose load suggesting an incretin effect.

Due to the inflammatory processes different cell populations infiltrate the intestine. It is likely that these changes in the intestinal architecture and ongoing inflammation may act systemically and affect other compartments such as adipose tissue and thereby cardiovascular risk. Several clinical trials have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with IBD. However the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Therefore aim of the present study was to analyze the possible interrelationships between colitis adipose tissue and atherosclerosis. For this purpose a murine model of accelerated atherosclerosis (ApoE-deficient mice) was combined with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced chronic colitis. Male 4-5 weeks old mice were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks. During this period chronic colitis was induced by 3 repeating cycles of DSS applied for 6 days. As known from the literature treatment with DSS led to decreased weight gain compared to controls. Multiplex analysis of plasma samples revealed an increase of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 G-CSF and MIP-1a) as well as adipokines supposed to have more anti-inflammatory properties such as ghrelin and glucagon like peptide-1 in the DSS-treated group. In addition a decrease in adipocyte size in epididymal adipose tissue was evident in the colitis group. Analysis of periaortic adipose tissue revealed that the content of hyaluronic acid a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) was significantly increased under DSS treatment as determined by affinityhistochemistry of adipose tissue. This increase was even more pronounced in the thoracic part of the aorta. Finally in vitro supernatants of organ cultures of colonic tissue derived from colitis mice inhibited differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.

We recently demonstrated that cerebral ischemic stress causes hyperglycemia (i.e. post-ischemic hyperglycemia) and may worsen ischemic neuronal damage in a mouse model of focal ischemia. However the detailed mechanisms are still unknown. The sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) generates inward currents in the process of transporting glucose into cells resulting in depolarization and increased excitability which is well known to be caused by cerebral ischemia. Hence we focused on the role of SGLT on the development of neuronal damage using a global ischemic model. Male ddY mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO). The neuronal damage was estimated by histological analysis using HE staining on day 3 after BCAO. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of phlorizin (a specific and competitive inhibitor of SGLT 200 mg/kg immediately after reperfusion) suppressed the development of post-ischemic hyperglycemia on day 1 after BCAO. In contrast intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of phlorizin (40 mug/mouse immediately and 6 h after reperfusion) had no effect on day 1 after BCAO. Interestingly the development of ischemic neuronal damage was significantly suppressed by i.p. and i.c.v. administration of phlorizin on day 3 after BCAO.

Enhancement of monocyte extravasation leads to increased perfusion recovery. Thus far stimulation of monocyte extravasation has not been clinically possible. Chemokines which facilitate monocyte extravasation are broken down by the peptidase CD26. Our aim was to use a clinically available CD26 inhibitor Januvia to enhance monocyte extravasation and thus increase perfusion recovery. Methods: 40 C57Bl6/J and 60 C57Bl6/J ApoE-/- mice underwent ligation of the right femoral artery. Mice were either treated with a single dose of Januvia daily doses or with a placebo. Perfusion recovery was assessed using a combination of microspheres and flow cytometry and calculated as percentage recovery compared to the non operated left hind limb. Blood samples were collected and leukocyte subsets were determined using flow cytometry. Monocyte extravasation was assessed using histological staining with a MOMA2 antibody 4 days after femoral artery ligation. Results: Early perfusion recovery measured 7 days after ligation was enhanced by a single dose of Januvia in ApoE-/- mice: placebo vs single dose treatment 29% vs 36% (p<0.02). Daily treatment with Januvia also enhanced early perfusion recovery: placebo vs daily treatment 29% vs 39% (p<0.01). Late perfusion recovery measured 2 months after ligation was also assessed. Single dose treatment resulted in a small increase in late perfusion recovery placebo vs single dose treatment 60% vs 64% (p=n.s.). Daily treatment however resulted in a significantincrease in late perfusion recovery 60% vs 83% (p<0.001). A decrease in peripheral blood monocyte numbers after treatment with Januvia was observed (56% of placebo p<0001) with a concurrent increase in monocyte numbers in the hind limb muscle. Conclusion: CD26 inhibition is a stimulus for the formation of a collateral circulation after artery stenosis possibly due to enhanced monocyte extravasation.

P.","CD26 inhibition enhances perfusion recovery in ApoE-/-mice",2013,"Curr Vasc Pharmacol","OBJECTIVE: The adaptive growth of blood vessels is important to prevent tissue loss following arterial occlusion. Extravasation of monocytes is essential for this process. The peptidase CD26 targets SDF-1 alpha a chemokine regulating monocyte trafficking. We hypothesized that blocking SDF-1 alpha inactivation using a commercially available CD26 inhibitor accelerates perfusion recovery without detrimental side effects on plaque stability. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atherosclerosis prone ApoE-/- mice underwent femoral artery ligation and received a CD26 inhibitor or placebo. CD26 inhibition increased short term (7 days) perfusion recovery after both single and daily doses compared to placebo 36% +/- 2 (p=0.017) and 39% +/- 2 (p=0.008) vs. 29% +/- 3 respectively. Long term (56 days) perfusion recovery increased after daily treatment compared to placebo 83% +/- 3 vs. 60% +/- 2 (p<0.001). CD26 inhibition did not result in increased atherosclerotic plaque instability or inflammatory cell infiltration. CD26 inhibition increased macrophage number around growing collaterals SDF-1 alpha plasma levels and monocyte expression of the activation marker CD11b and the SDF-1 alpha receptor CXCR-4. CONCLUSIONS: CD26 inhibition enhanced perfusion recovery following arterial occlusion via attenuated SDF-1 alpha inactivation and increased monocyte activation. There was no observable aggravation of atherosclerosis and CD26 inhibition could therefore offer a novel approach for therapeutic arteriogenesis in patients.",NA,"1","21-Aug","11","1570-1611",967,"In_database","duplicate"

Surface polyFn is critical for pulmonary metastasis presumably by facilitating lung vascular arrest via endothelial dipeptidylpeptidase IV (CD26). Here we show that cell-surface polyFn assembly is initiated by the state of suspension is dependent upon the synthesis and secretion of cellular Fn and is augmented in a dose- and time-dependent manner by plasma Fn. PolyFn assembly is regulated by protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon) which translocates rapidly and in increasing amounts from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated. PolyFn assembly is impeded by select inhibitors of this kinase i.e. bisindolylmaleimide I Ro-32-0432 Go6983 and Rottlerin by the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated and time-dependent loss of PKCepsilon protein and decreased plasma membrane translocation and more specifically by stable transfection of lung-metastatic MTF7L breast cancer cells with small interfering RNA-PKCepsilon and dominant-negative PKCepsilon constructs (e.g. RD-PKCepsilon). The inability to assemble a cell surface-associated polyFn coat by knockdown of endogenous Fn or PKCepsilon impedes cancer cells from metastasis to the lungs. The present studies identify a novel regulatory mechanism for polyFn assembly on blood-borne breast cancer cells and depict its effect on pulmonary metastasis. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705839200","12","7616-7627","283","0021-9258

Pharmacological inhibition of GLP-1 degradation tips the balance toward an inhibitory effect on intestinal production of atherogenic CM particles. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db12-0202","2","373-381","62","0012-1797

We aimed to evaluate effects of SGLT2i on atherosclerosis in diabetic Apoe-/- mice. Methods: Male Apoe-/- mice were received i.p. injection of STZ to induce diabetes or saline. The mice at 17 weeks old were switched to atherogenic diet feeding and randomly assigned to dapagliflozin (Dapa) treatment or vehicle. Dapa was given by drinking water (5mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks metabolic parameters were measured and sacrificed to evaluate atherosclerosis and foam cell formation of peritoneal macrophages (Mphi). Results: In the diabetic mice Dapa decreased FBG HbA1c and glucose- AUC in OGTT compared to vehicle while blood pressure plasma insulin and lipid levels were no changed. Diabetic Apoe-/- mice exhibited progressed atherosclerosis and foam cell formation compared to nondiabetic counterparts. Dapa suppressed atherosclerosis by 33% compared to vehicle in the diabetic mice while Dapa did not show any effect in the non diabetic mice. Dapa also decreased foam cell formation of Mphi in the diabetic mice. In diabetic groups total atherosclerotic lesion was correlated to foam cell formation (Dapa: r=0.98 p<0.01 vehicle: r=0.91 p<0.01) and also correlated to HbA1c (Dapa: r=0.96 p<0.01; vehicle: r=0.71 p<0.01). However no correlation between atherosclerosis and foam cell formation was observed in non diabetic groups. In the analysis of gene expressions in Mphi Dapa decreased CD36 and ACAT-1 expressions and increased ABCA1 expression.

However it remains unknown whether DPP-4 inhibitors might also exert anti-atherogenic effects in bigger animals. We examined the effect of anagliptin a DPP-4 inhibitor on the development of atherosclerosis in the aorta and coronary arteries in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Materials and methods: Japanese white rabbits were fed either a normal diet or a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol. The cholesterol-fed rabbits were given drinking water not mixed (n = 18) or mixed with 3 mg/mL of anagliptin (n = 16) for 12 weeks. The lipoprotein fractions were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The serum oxidative stress markers 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OHdG) and malondealdehyde (MDA) were measured by ELISA and TBARS respectively. Inflammatory cytokine gene expressions in the carotid artery were quantified by real time-qPCR. We measured the lesion area in the aorta and the coronary arteries in seven crosssections of the heart. Values were expressed as mean +/- SE. Results: Dietary cholesterol intake led to a marked increase of the serum total-cholesterol (TC) level (37.9 +/- 3.9 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.04 mmol/L) with the most striking increase seen in the VLDL fraction (30-80 nm) among the major lipoproteins. No significant changes of the body weight water intake HbA1c serum lipids and lipoproteins or glucose response to intravenous glucose loading were observed following the administration of anagliptin. The plasma DPP-4 activity was suppressed by 86% and the plasma active GLP-1 levels doubled. Dietary cholesterol intake resulted in the development of severe atherosclerosis in the aorta with a ratio of the lesion area to the total aortic surface areas of 22.0 +/- 2.3% and anagliptin treatment induced marked suppression of the percent lesion area to 8.6 +/- 2.1% (p < 0.001).

Japanese White rabbits fed a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol were given anagliptin (0 1 or 3 mg/ml mixed in drinking water; n=16-18 each) for 12 weeks. Dietary cholesterol increased the serum LDL-cholesterol level to over 1000 mg/dl. No significant changes of the body weight water intake serum lipids HbA1c or the glucose response to intravenous glucose loading were observed following administration of anagliptin. The plasma DPP-4 activity was suppressed by up to 84% and the active GLP-1 levels doubled. Dietary cholesterol resulted in the development of severe atherosclerosis in the aorta with a ratio of the plaque to the total aortic surface areas of 22+/-10%. Anagliptin at 1 and 3 mg/ml suppressed the plaque ratio to 18+/-11 and 9+/-8% (p<0.001) respectively. Mild atherosclerotic lesions were observed in the coronary arteries of cholesterol-fed rabbits. Anagliptin decreased both the intima and media areas and decreased the intima/media ratio in the coronary arteries. Notably the macrophage-positive area in the coronary arteries was suppressed by 78% (p<0.05) with anagliptin. The ratio of macrophage area to the plaque area was also substantially decreased by 83%. Additionally arterial TNF-alpha mRNA expression was reduced following administration of anagliptin.

Neointimal hyperplasia was significantly attenuated in Exendin group compared to PBS group (neointima/media ratio 1.1+/-0.4 vs 2.9+/-1.4 p<0.05 in normal diet 0.6+/-0.3 vs 3.2+/-1.4 p<0.05 in high fat diet). In vitro treatment of rat smooth muscle cells with exendin-4 suppressed PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation and this effect was reversed by either MDL-12330A a cAMP inhibitor or PKI14-22 a protein kinase A-specific inhibitor. Conclusions: Our data suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury by inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and that this effect may contribute to the attenuation of atherosclerotic lesion by Exendin-4.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease also referred to as coronary heart disease is the most common type of CVD and more than 90% of cases are based on coronary atherosclerosis. Liraglutide a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog is used for treating diabetes in the clinic. Animal and clinical studies have found that GLP-1 may also have cardioprotective effects but the mechanism remains incompletely understood. Palmitic acid (PA) is a saturated free fatty acid secreted by adipose tissue. It plays a role in obesity-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver. Elevated serum free fatty acids can cause endothelial dysfunction. Here we assessed whether liraglutide ameliorated palmitic acid-induced endothelial dysfunction. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with PA for 16 h followed by addition of 100 nM liraglutide for 30 min. The phosphorylation of JNK IKKalpha/beta eNOS PKC and AMPK was detected by western blots. The mRNA expression of IL-6 E-selectin VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was measured by realtime PCR. Macrophage migration toward HUVECs was detected by transwell assays. The NO level was measured with a Nitric Oxide Colorimetric Assay Kit. We further explored the roles of PKC and AMPK in the mechanism underlying improvement of endothelial dysfunction by liraglutide using specific inhibitors. Results: Liraglutide significantly inhibited not only the PA-induced phosphorylation of JNK and IKKalpha/beta and mRNA expression of IL-6 E-selectin VCAM-1 and ICAM- 1 but also the migration of macrophages to endothelial cells. Meanwhile liraglutide significantly increased the phosphorylation of eNOS and AMPK and the concentration of NO but did not affect the phosphorylation of PKC.

Furthermore we performed a model of guide-wire induced femoral artery injury in mice with or without 3mg/kg/day oral linagliptin treatment (n=9 in each group). 4 weeks after injury serum GLP-1 concentration was significantly higher in linagliptin-treated mice (CT14.79+/-0.72pmol/l vs. Lina 25.97+/-1.99pmol/l) though blood glucose level (CT 69.9+/-0.41mg/dl vs. Lina 72.2+/-1.33mg/dl) and body weight (CT 24.47+/-0.55g vs. Lina 23.82+/-0.71g) were not changed. Next we measured square of neointima formation and media subsequently calculated intima/media ratio. Interestingly intima/ media ratio was decreased with linagliptin-treated mice (CT 0.85+/-0.28 vs. Lina 0.46+/-0.17). These data suggest that DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin might be able to attenuate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointima formation after vascular injury independent on glucose lowering effect.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db13-388-679","SUPPL. 1","A126","62","0012-1797",1307,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

To elucidate the molecularmechanisms we focused on the effect of DPP-4i on expression of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes. Materials and methods: Cultured U937 human monocytes were treated with or without 10 ug/ml of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and teneligliptin (1-10 nM). Treated cells lysates and RNA were collected for Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Some cells were treated with teneligliptin (5 and 10 nM) or vehicle with LPS and RNA was subjected to microarray analysis. Results: Teneligliptin (1-10 nM) widely suppressed the expression of inflammatory molecules such as IL-1beta IL-6 TNF-alpha NF-kappaB TLR-4 MCP-1 CCR2 IL-8 IP-10 and RANTES induced by LPS without affecting cell proliferation. Treatments with antibody (Ab) or small interfering (si) RNA against CD26 mimicked anti-inflammatory effect of teneligliptin. Microarray analysis failed to detect a specific molecule to explain anti-inflammatory action of teneligliptin suggesting posttranslational mechanisms. We nominated caveolin (Cav)-1 a signaling protein associated with caveolae as a candidate molecule because it has been reported that Cav-1 binds to CD26 via DPP-4 catalytic site which mediates inflammatory signals. Anti-Cav-1 polyclonal antibody [H97] recognizing 82-178 amino acids of Cav-1 significantly suppressed IL-1beta IL-6 TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB mRNAs whereas anti-Cav-1 monoclonal antibody [7c8] reacts epitope between residue 32 and the C-terminus of Cav-1 did not. Cav-1 gene expression was not altered by LPS or teneligliptin however Cav-1 was phosphorylated by LPS and teneligliptin attenuated LPSinduced p-Cav-1 generation. Likewise anti-CD26Ab suppressed p-Cav- 1generation. Anti-Cav-1Ab [7c8] suppressed slightly but anti-Cav-1Ab [H97] strongly suppressed p-Cav-1 generation by LPS. Induction of siRNAs into CD26 and Cav-1 genes successfully suppressed gene expression of CD26 and Cav-1 which resulted in significantly suppression of LPS-induced expression of IL-1beta IL-6 TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB mRNAs. CD26siRNA and Cav-1siRNA tended to suppressCD86mRNA a downstream of NF-kappaB signal. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated by LPS and teneligliptin Anti-CD26Ab and anti-Cav-1Ab [H97] all suppressed p- ERK1/2 generation. Likewise CD26siRNA and Cav-1siRNA suppressed p-ERK1/2 generation. IRAK-4 a master molecule of downstream of TLR-4 signaling was phosphorylated by LPS. Teneligliptin significantly suppressed LPS-induced p-IRAK-4 generation. Anti-CD26Ab and anti- Cav-1Ab[H97] tended to suppress p-IRAL-4 expression.

This dysregulation in blood lipids termed postprandial dyslipidemia is proponent to the development of atherogenic fatty remnants precursors to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently our laboratory has demonstrated that the gut-derived hormone glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 can attenuate intes-tinal lipoprotein production through a complex gut-brain-liver axis. Since intestinally-derived GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in the blood it is likely GLP-1 exerts its effects in the portal venous bed activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1)R in overlying vagal nerve terminals. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effect of an acute dose of GLP-1 on intestinal lipoprotein metabolism if injected directly into the portal vein. Methods: To assess this Syrian golden hamsters underwent surgical insertion of a silastic catheter into their jugular vein then the portal vein was exposed and injected with an acute dose of active GLP-1 peptide (7-36) (1mg; n5) or vehicle (PBS; n5).

Our results indicate that iNKT cells are required for the weight loss and anti-inflammatory but not glycaemic effects of GLP-1 analogue therapy and provide additional mechanistic rationale for its use outside of diabetes.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db14-1-388","SUPPL. 1","A75","63","0012-1797",1261,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Animal studies show that fasting may increase longevity and alter biological parameters related to longevity. We evaluated whether fasting initiates acute changes in biomarker expression in humans that may impact short- and long-term health. Methods and results: Apparently-healthy volunteers (N=30) without a recent history of fasting were enrolled in a randomized cross-over trial. A one-day water-only fast was the intervention and changes in biomarkers were the study endpoints. Bonferroni correction required p<=0.00167 for significance (p<0.05 was a trend that was only suggestively significant). The one-day fasting intervention acutely increased human growth hormone (p=1.1x10<sup>-4</sup>) hemoglobin (p=4.8x10<sup>-7</sup>) red blood cell count (p=2.5x10<sup>-6</sup>) hematocrit (p=3.0x10<sup>-6</sup>) total cholesterol (p=5.8x10<sup>-5</sup>) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.0015) and decreased triglycerides (p=1.3x10<sup>-4</sup>) bicarbonate (p=3.9x10<sup>-4</sup>) and weight (p=1.0x10<sup>-7</sup>) compared to a day of usual eating.

Bile acid effects are mediated through the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) the G-protein coupled receptor TGR5 (Gpbar-1) and various other bile acid sensing molecules. TGR5 is almost ubiquitously expressed and has been detected in different non-parenchymal cells of human and rodent liver. Here TGR5 has anti-inflammatory anti-apoptotic and choleretic functions. Mice with targeted deletion of TGR5 are protected from the development of cholesterol gallstones. Administration of specific TGR5 agonists lowers serum and liver triglyceride levels thereby reducing liver steatosis. Furthermore activation of TGR5 promotes intestinal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release thereby modulating glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Additionally TGR5 exerts anti-inflammatory actions resulting in decreased liver injury in animal models of sepsis. These beneficial effects make TGR5 an attractive therapeutic target for metabolic diseases such as diabetes obesity atherosclerosis and steatohepatitis. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2012.03.008","5","412-419","36","2210-7401

We reported that incretins [glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)] or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4I) suppressed atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-null (Apoe/) mice.

This model was used to investigate the effects of chronic lixisenatide treatment on atherosclerotic plaque formation. Materials and methods: Male ApoE KO mice (B.129P2-apoe tm1Unc/J) were treated for 16 weeks by continuous infusion via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps (ALZETTM).

"Indrakusuma I.Romacho T.Eckel J.","PAR2 is upregulated by adipocyte-derived factors and high fat diet in the vascular wall",2015,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Obesity is associated with impaired vascular function. However the underlying mechanisms linking obesity and cardiovascular diseases are not fully understood. Protease activated receptor- 2 (PAR2) is a G protein coupled receptor that can be activated by proteases as well as other activating peptides. Under physiological conditions PAR2 exerts multiple functions such as controlling vascular tone and coagulation. In pathological conditions PAR2 is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and promotes vasoconstriction. However little is known about the impact of obesity on PAR2 in the vasculature. Our group has recently proposed that the adipokine soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) acts as an agonist for PAR2 leading to pro-atherogenic effects in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Thus we aimed to investigate the impact of adipocyte-derived factors on the expression and function of PAR2 in the context of obesity-related vascular dysfunction. Materials and methods: SMC were treated with conditioned medium (CM) from in vitro differentiated primary human adipocytes IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) or YKL-40 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Additionally a time course with CM treatment was performed in SMC. In parallel human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were incubated with CM for 4 h. Protein and mRNA expression were assessed byWestern Blot and qRT-PCR respectively. BrdU incorporation was analyzed to determine SMC proliferation. Furthermore C57BL/6 mice were fed with either a chow or a 60% high fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks prior to isolation and subsequent mRNAextraction fromaortas.DPP4 activity of serumsamples from mice were analyzed with a DPP4 activity kit. Results: We observed that CM treatment significantly enhanced PAR2 protein expression in both SMC and HCAEC (1.4- 1.5- fold respectively). Interestingly PAR2 mRNA level in SMC showed a peak (1.7 fold) after 1 h of CM exposure. PAR2 protein level was increased in SMC by the adipokines IL-1beta (1.8 fold) or YKL-40 (1.4 fold). Moreover CM exerted a pro-atherogenic action on SMC since it promoted proliferation at 24 h. This observation was a PAR2-specific effect abrogated in the presence of the PAR2 antagonist GB83 (10 muM). In vivo aortas of HFD-fed mice expressed significantly more PAR2 mRNA (1.5 fold) compared to aortas from lean mice. PAR2 upregulation in aortas was in parallel with an increase in the enzymatic activity of DPP4 in the serumof the animals treated with HFD (1.8 fold). Conclusion: We showed that PAR2 is upregulated in two different vascular cell types in response to CM and in response to specific adipocytederived factors leading to a pro-atherogenic effect. PAR2 expression levels were also elevated by HFD in murine aortas. In conclusion under obesogenic conditions where circulating levels of adipokines such as IL- 1beta YKL40 or sDPP4 are elevated PAR2 arises as an important player linking obesity-related adipose tissue inflammation with atherogenesis.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3687-4",NA,"S581","1)","0012-186X",440,"In_database","unique"

However the mechanism(s) by which CMK influences glucose homeostasis is yet unclear. The current study investigated the changes in the glucose homeostatic parameters the incretin hormones and the inflammatory cytokines in the CMK-treated diabetic animals. A model of type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin 40mg/kg/day for 4 repeated doses. Camel milk treatment was administered for 8 weeks. The changes in glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) glucose tolerance fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion insulin resistance (IR) TNF-alpha TGF-beta1 lipid profile atherogenic index (AI) and body weight were investigated. The untreated diabetic animals showed hyperglycemia increased HOMA-IR hyperlipidemia elevated AI high serum incretins [GLP-1 and GIP] TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 levels and weight loss as compared with the control group. Camel milk treatment to the diabetic animals resulted in significant lowered fasting glucose level hypolipidemia decreased HOMA-IR recovery of insulin secretion weight gain and no mortality during the study. Additionally CMK inhibits the diabetes-induced elevation in incretin hormones TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 levels. The increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion decreased HOMA-IR modulation of the secretion and/or the action of incretins and the anti-inflammatory effect are anticipated mechanisms to the antidiabetic effect of CMK and suggest it as a valuable adjuvant antidiabetic therapy. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1368711","6","404-411","46","0018-5043

Methods: Japanese white rabbits underwent 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 48 h of reperfusion. Rabbits were assigned randomly to 6 groups (n=7 in each): a control group a voglibose group fed diets containing 3.5mg/kg/day voglibose for 7days and a voglibose + exendin (9-39) group (fed the same diet as the voglibose group along with i.v. exendin (9-39) a GLP-1 receptor blocker 3 nmol/l) an exendin only (9-39) group (3 nmol/l) a voglibose + wortmannin group (fed the same diet as the voglibose group along with i.v. wortmannin a PI3K inhibitor 0.6mg/kg) a wortmannin only group (0.6mg/kg). Myocardial infarct size was measured as a percentage of the risk area. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Plasma GLP-1 levels were measured before and 1 2 and 3 hours after eating. Western blotting was performed to examine the expression of Akt and eNOS in the myocardium. Results: The infarct size was significantly smaller in the voglibose group (23.4+/-3.0%) than in the control group (43.8+/-3.4%) (p<0.001) and this effect was abolished by pretreatment with exendin(9-39) (38.2+/-2.9%) or wortmannin (46.8+/-1.8%).

This study was undertaken to determine whether and how vildagliptin (a potent dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor) might reduce intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. METHODS: Twelve rabbits were randomly divided into two groups; one group received vildagliptin orally (10 mg/kg/d; n = 6) whereas the control group (n = 6) did not.

"Lamine A.Letourneau M.Doan N. D.Maucotel J.Couvineau A.Vaudry H.Chatenet D.Vaudry D.Fournier A.","Characterizations of a synthetic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide analog displaying potent neuroprotective activity and reduced in vivo cardiovascular side effects in a Parkinson's disease model",2016,"Neuropharmacology","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a steady loss of dopamine neurons through apoptotic inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. In that line of view the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) with its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its anti-apoptotic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties has proven to offer potent neuroprotection in various PD models. Nonetheless its peripheral actions paired with low metabolic stability hampered its clinical use. We have developed Ac-[Phe(pI)<sup>6</sup> Nle<sup>17</sup>]PACAP(1-27) as an improved PACAP-derived neuroprotective compound. In vitro this analog stimulated cAMP production maintained mitochondrial potential and protected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>) toxicity as potently as PACAP. Furthermore contrasting with PACAP it is stable in human plasma and against dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. When injected intravenously to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice PACAP and Ac-[Phe(pI)<sup>6</sup> Nle<sup>17</sup>]PACAP(1-27) restored tyrosine hydoxylase expression into the substantia nigra and modulated the inflammatory response. Albeit falls of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were observed with both PACAP- and Ac-[Phe(pI)<sup>6</sup> Nle<sup>17</sup>]PACAP(1-27)-treated mice the intensity of the decrease as well as its duration were significantly less marked after iv injections of the analog than after those of the native polypeptide.

In that line of view the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) with its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its anti-apoptotic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties has proven to offer potent neuroprotection in various PD models. Nonetheless its peripheral actions paired with low metabolic stability hampered its clinical use. We have developed Ac-[Phe(pI)(6) Nle(17)]PACAP(1-27) as an improved PACAP-derived neuroprotective compound. In vitro this analog stimulated cAMP production maintained mitochondrial potential and protected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) toxicity as potently as PACAP. Furthermore contrasting with PACAP it is stable in human plasma and against dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. When injected intravenously to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice PACAP and Ac-[Phe(pI)(6) Nle(17)]PACAP(1-27) restored tyrosine hydoxylase expression into the substantia nigra and modulated the inflammatory response. Albeit falls of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were observed with both PACAP- and Ac-[Phe(pI)(6) Nle(17)]PACAP(1-27)-treated mice the intensity of the decrease as well as its duration were significantly less marked after iv injections of the analog than after those of the native polypeptide. Moreover no significant changes in heart rate were measured with the animals for both compounds.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control group diabetes group and liraglutide treated group. The T2DM rats model with atherosclerosis were induced by high fat diet followed small dosage streptozotocin injection. Body weight and blood glucose levels were monitored once a week for 3 months and then the rats were sacrificed.Peripheral blood and aorta tissues were collected for further biochemical and pathological estimation respectively. Moreover immunohistochemistry staining was used to detect the infiltration of macrophages and cell apoptosis in tissue samples. The amount of microvesicles of atherosclerotic plaques was determined by ELISA. Western blot was applied to detect the protein expressions of CHOP GRP78 and caspase-3 in tissue samples. The mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c and FAS were detected by RT-PCR. Results: The rat model of diabetic atherosclerosis was established successfully.

Since vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play pivotal roles in the occurrence of diabetic atherosclerosis it is important to investigate the role of LIRA in reducing the harmful effects of high-glucose (HG) treatment in cultured VSMCs and identifying associated molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Primary rat VSMCs were exposed to low or high glucose-containing medium with or without LIRA. They were challenged with HG in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 or glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP-1R) inhibitors. Cell proliferation and viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell migration was determined by Transwell migration and scratch wound assays. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to determine apoptosis and protein expression respectively. RESULTS: Under the HG treatment VSMCs exhibited increased migration proliferation and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and ERK1/2 along with reduced apoptosis (all p < 0.01 vs. control). These effects were significantly attenuated with LIRA co-treatment (all p < 0.05 vs. HG alone). Inhibition of PI3K kinase and ERK1/2 similarly attenuated the HG-induced effects (all p < 0.01 vs. HG alone). GLP-1R inhibitors effectively reversed the beneficial effects of LIRA on HG treatment (all p < 0.05).

Recent evidence has also suggest anti-atherosclerotic effects of the other main incretin GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide) in mice. However the underlying mechanisms remain unexplained so far. In this study we analyzed the effect of GIP on vascular remodeling and inflammation in ApoE-/- mice. Methods and results: GIP and LacZ were overexpressed in ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks using an adeno-associated viral vector system (n=9- 10/group). GIP overexpression had no effect on body weight lipid profile and glucose tolerance but led to significantly reduced plaque macrophage infiltration (GIP 71% vs. LacZ 131% MOMA-2 expression per lesion area p<0.05) compared to LacZ at the aortic root with no change of overall lesion size. This was paralleled by increased plaque collagen content and fibrous cap thickness in the GIP group indicating improved plaque stability. Consistent with our in vivo results we found GIP incubation to reduce MCP-1-induced migration of human and murine monocytes in vitro which was paralleled by decreased expression of the cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in VSMC (vascular smooth muscle cells). In addition GIP inhibited proinflammatory activation of macrophages as shown by a reduction of LPS-induced NfkappaB activation as well as IL-6 and TNF- alpha secretion. Furthermore GIP decreased TNF-alpha-induced MMP-2/-9 expression in VSMC in vitro suggesting a possible protective role of GIP in inflammationinduced vascular remodeling. Conclusion: Overexpression of GIP in mice improved plaque stability and attenuated pathological vascular inflammation and remodeling by inhibition of monocyte infiltration and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine secretion cell adhesion molecule and MMP-2/-9 expression.

"Kang H. M.Jin J.Park C.","Exendin-4 stimulates adult neurogenesis in mouse sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) after photothrombotic ischemia",2011,"FEBS Journal","Cerebral ischemia induces neurogenesis. Neurogenesis occurs mainly in two area of adult mammalian brain including of humans: the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the anterior part of the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) along the ventricle. In addition newly generated neurons in the SVZ migrated to the ischemic boundary region. Several factors regulated proliferation migration differentiation of neuronal precursor cells. Exendin-4 is peptide hormone stable analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and that selectively binds GLP- 1 receptor. Recently it has been demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor promotes conservation dopaminergic neurons in rodent Parkinson's diseases model Exendin-4 markedly reduced cortical infarction induced by transient Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion (MCAo). In addition chronic treatment of exendin-4 affects cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus. However Exendin-4 is still unknown whether it is stimulated neurogenesis.

Neurogenesis occurs mainly in two area of adult mammalian brain including of humans: the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the anterior part of the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) along the ventricle. In addition newly generated neurons in the SVZ migrated to the ischemic boundary region. Several factors regulated proliferation migration differentiation of neuronal precursor cells. Exendin-4 is peptide hormone stable analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and that selectively binds GLP- 1 receptor. Recently it has been demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor promotes conservation dopaminergic neurons in rodent Parkinson's diseases model Exendin-4 markedly reduced cortical infarction induced by transient Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion (MCAo). In addition chronic treatment of exendin-4 affects cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus. However Exendin-4 is still unknown whether it is stimulated neurogenesis. In this study we used photothrombotic focal ischemia model in mice and observed that systemic administration of Exendin-4 significantly increased not only 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation marker but also Ki-67 necessary cellular marker for proliferation in SVZ.

VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aortas of four-week-old SD rats and the cells fromthe third to fifth passages were used for in vitro experiments: WST-1 assay FACS analysis RT-PCR and Western blotting and wound healing assay. The expression of DPP-4 in VSMCs was knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX. Results: Gemigliptin significantly prevented the neointimal hyperplasia induced by ligation injury in mouse carotid arteries in vivo. Likewise the proliferation of rat primary VSMCs stimulated by 20% FBS was significantly attenuated by gemigliptin in a dose dependent manner confirmed by the decreased phospho-Rb leading to G1 cycle cell arrest consequently. We found that gemiglitin enhanced Nrf2 activity by not only its mRNA expression but also increased Keap1 proteosomal degradation by p62 resulting in the induction of Nrf2 target genes such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 and heme oxygenase 1. The anti-proliferative role of gemigliptin disappeared in VSMCs with DPP4 siRNA knockdown indicating that the endogenous DPP4 in VSMCs mediated the effect of gemigliptin. Besides gemigliptin diminished TNF-alpha-mediated cell adhesion molecules such as MCP-1 VCAM-1 and MMP2 activity in VSMCs. Conclusion: Taken together our data indicate that gemigliptin exerts a prohibitory effect on the proliferation and migration of VSMCs via Nrf2 activity for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3687-4","1 SUPPL. 1","S34","58","0012-186X",1186,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Methods: We used an in vivo Sprague-Dawley rat IR model and ex vivo Langendorff injury model. Using a left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion model animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated rats (Sham n=5) IR-injured rats treated with placebo (IR n=6) and IR-injured treated with exenatide (IR + EXE n=6). Using the Langendorff model rats were randomly divided into two groups: IR injury with placebo (IR n=4) and IR injury with exenatide (IR+EXE n=4). Morphological and mechanical changes to mitochondria were analyzed by AFM. Results: Exenatide improved cardiac function as evidenced by improvement in left ventricle fractional shortening (LV FS) and LV ejection fraction (EF). The ratio of infarct area to risk area (IA/RA) was significantly reduced in exenatide-treated rats. According to AFM IR significantly increased the area of isolated mitochondria indicative of mitochondrial swelling.

Using a left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion model animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated rats (Sham n=5) IR-injured rats treated with placebo (IR n=6) and IR-injured treated with exenatide (IR + EXE n=6). Using the Langendorff model rats were randomly divided into two groups: IR injury with placebo (IR n=4) and IR injury with exenatide (IR+EXE n=4). Morphological and mechanical changes to mitochondria were analyzed by AFM. Results: Exenatide improved cardiac function as evidenced by improvement in left ventricle fractional shortening (LV FS) and LV ejection fraction (EF). The ratio of infarct area to risk area (IA/RA) was significantly reduced in exenatide-treated rats. According to AFM IR significantly increased the area of isolated mitochondria indicative of mitochondrial swelling. IR + EXE reduced mitochondrial area and ameliorated the adhesion force of mitochondrial surfaces. Conclusion: Our results suggest that exenatide provides cardioprotective effects against IR injury by improving the morphological and mechanical characteristics of mitochondria.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.277","SUPPL. 1","438-439","17","1388-9842",1201,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

The aim of this study is to clarify whether diabetic condition influences vascular GLP-1 receptor expression and which factor could regulate GLP-1 receptor expression in artery. Materials and methods: We examined the biochemical data and artery wall thickening using 18-week-old male db/db mice compared to db/m mice. Excised thoracic artery was specifically collected and vascular endothelial cells were cultured. Gene expression of various factors in the intima and media was analyzed by real time RT-PCR. Primer pairs encoding genes associated with GLP-1 receptor and factors related to arteriosclerosis were prepared. We exposed HUVEC to siRNA directed to TCF7L2 (siTCF7L2) or scrambled control siRNA and cultured for 24 hours. And real-time RT-PCR with Sybr Green was performed. Each gene expression was semi-quantified by the comparative Ct method with each result in beta-actin as a control. We performed immunostaining using anti- GLP-1 receptor antibody in thoracic artery. These results were expressed as mean +/- SE. AWilcoxon test was used to test the difference between 2 groups with p < 0.05 regarded as significant. Results: Arteriosclerosis index [(area of artery outer periphery - area of artery cavity)/area of artery outer periphery)] was significantly higher in db/db mice compared to db/m mice (db/db/db/m = 0.43/0.37).

Although many anti diabetic agents were investigated it is not clear whether the glucose lowerin effect by SGLT2i that did not affect insulin section or sensitivity exerts anti atherosclerotic properties. We aimed to evaluate effects of SGLT2i on atherosclerosis in diabetic Apoe-/- mice. Methods: Male Apoe-/- mice were received i.p. injection of STZ to induce diabetes or saline. The mice at 17 weeks old were switched to atherogenic diet feeding and randomly assigned to dapagliflozin (Dapa) treatment or vehicle. Dapa was given by drinking water (5mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks metabolic parameters were measured and sacrificed to evaluate atherosclerosis and foam cell formation of peritoneal macrophages (Mphi). Results: In the diabetic mice Dapa decreased FBG HbA1c and glucose- AUC in OGTT compared to vehicle while blood pressure plasma insulin and lipid levels were no changed. Diabetic Apoe-/- mice exhibited progressed atherosclerosis and foam cell formation compared to nondiabetic counterparts. Dapa suppressed atherosclerosis by 33% compared to vehicle in the diabetic mice while Dapa did not show any effect in the non diabetic mice. Dapa also decreased foam cell formation of Mphi in the diabetic mice. In diabetic groups total atherosclerotic lesion was correlated to foam cell formation (Dapa: r=0.98 p<0.01 vehicle: r=0.91 p<0.01) and also correlated to HbA1c (Dapa: r=0.96 p<0.01; vehicle: r=0.71 p<0.01).

We reported that incretins (glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)) or incretin enhancer (a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i)) suppressed atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice. We examined effects of incretin-related agents on AAA and atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice infused with angiotensin-II (AngII). Apoe-/- mice fed atherogenic diet were continuously infused with saline AngII (2000ng/kg/min) AngII +GLP-1(2.16nmol/ kg/day) or AngII +GIP (25nmol/kg/day) by an osmotic pump for 4 weeks. A DPP4i (MK0626 6 mg/kg/day) was dietary given without/with incretin receptor antagonists ((Pro3)GIP and Exendin (9-39)). Metabolic parameters were not different among groups. AAA incidence by AngII was 70% and DPP4i reduced the incidence to 40% (p=0.1). Moreover DPP4i suppressed AAA dilatation (ratio of AAA width to aorta: 2.8+/-0.1 vs. 3.7+/-0.2 p<0.05). Incretins failed to suppress AAA. While elastin disruption was not changed fibrosis and bleeding surrounded AAA were reduced by DPP4i. Atherosclerosis exacerbated by AngII was not suppressed by incretins or DPPi while DPP4i decreased the lesions within the AAAs. Addition of incretin receptor blockers did not change effects of DPP4i on AAA. IL-1 beta expression in the aorta was significantly reduced by DPP4i while IL-6 and TNF alpha were not changed by DPP4i. In addition DPP4i increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 expression and tended to decrease matrix metalloproteinases-9 expression (p=0.1).

Strikingly 10 mug NPY for 14 days led to vessel occlusion with an atherosclerotic-like lesion with thrombus and neointima containing neovessels macrophages matrix and lipids. Y1 or Y5 receptor antagonist completely prevented the effect of NPY and reduced angioplasty-induced neointima by 50%. Conclusions - Angioplasty upregulates platelet and vascular NPY systems which then contribute to neointima formation via Y1 and Y5 receptor activation. Increasing NPY to high stress levels triggers formation of a thrombotic atherosclerotic-like lesion and vessel occlusion. Thus NPY may be a risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and NPY receptor antagonists may be a possible new treatment for restenosis.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.ATV.0000071349.30914.25","7","1204-1210","23","1079-5642",1465,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Materials and methods: Experimental diabetes was induced by intrapertional injection of streptozotocin in 40 Wistar rats divided into (D & D-CMK) Groups. Two healthy (C& C-CKM) Groups served as control. Camel milk (50 ml/rat/day) was administered orally to the (D-CMK) and (C-CMK) Groups for 8 weeks. The (D) and (C) Groups received no treatment.

G.Knusden L.Ceriello A.","Liraglutide down regulates endoplasmic reticulum stress in human endothelial cells exposed to hyperglycaemia",2010,"Diabetologia","Background: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key organelle where membrane and secreted proteins fold into their tertiary and quaternary structure. The ER stress occurs when there is an accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins due to disruption of ER homeostasis. The accumulation of unfolded proteins results in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which is regulated by proteins such as IRE1alpha PERK and ATF6. ER stress increases PERK activity which phosphorylates eIF2alpha to reduce protein translation. ER contains molecular chaperone proteins including PDI calnexin Ero1-Lalpha and Grp78/BiP and others that promote oxidative protein folding. Data on pancreatic beta cells function indicate that augmented ER stress together with reduced insulin signalling both occur before the onset of frank diabetes. It has also been observed that ER stress may play a causative role in diabetic atherogenesis. Also recent data in mice suggests that hyperglycaemia increases intracellular ER stress prior to the onset of atherosclerosis. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 analogue that has been proven to enhance insulin signalling and reduce apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells. Investigating its effectiveness in reducing ER stress levels in endothelium might be of great use to determine its capacity in ameliorating not only the pancreatic function and insulin sensitivity but also prevent atherogenesis and thus cardiovascular complications in diabetics. Materials and methods: Confluent human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to a 15mM high glucose media with (HGL) or without (HG) 100nM of liraglutide. Controls were kept in a 5mM normal glucose media with (NGL) or without (NG) 100nM liraglutide with 10mM of mannitol for osmotic balance. After 12 hours of exposure to the hyperglycaemic media proteins from all the conditions were extracted. Protein analysis was conducted by western blotting. Results: HuVEC cells exposed to hg media lead to a significant (*p<0.01) up regulation of all the ER stress markers as detailed: PDI calnexin BiP Ero1- Lalpha IRE1 phospho-eIF2alpha compared to cells treated with ng. However in cells exposed to hg and liraglutide there was a significant reduction in ER stress protein expression levels compared to hg alone (PDI BiP Ero1-Lalpha IRE1 phospho-eIF2alpha: p<0.01; calnexin p<0.05) in HUVEC cells treated with and high glucose. Liraglutide had no additional effects on the basal expression of ER stress markers in normal glucose compared to control. Conclusion: Our in vitro data demonstrates that liraglutide significantly down-regulates ER stress markers in endothelial cells exposed to high glucose levels. This study indicates that liraglutide has additional beneficial effects to reduce ER stress and may support prevention of atherogenesis and thus cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-010-1872-z",NA,"S518","1)","0012-186X",675,"In_database","unique"

ER stress increases PERK activity which phosphorylates eIF2alpha to reduce protein translation. ER contains molecular chaperone proteins including PDI calnexin Ero1-Lalpha and Grp78/BiP and others that promote oxidative protein folding. Data on pancreatic beta cells function indicate that augmented ER stress together with reduced insulin signalling both occur before the onset of frank diabetes. It has also been observed that ER stress may play a causative role in diabetic atherogenesis. Also recent data in mice suggests that hyperglycaemia increases intracellular ER stress prior to the onset of atherosclerosis. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 analogue that has been proven to enhance insulin signalling and reduce apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells. Investigating its effectiveness in reducing ER stress levels in endothelium might be of great use to determine its capacity in ameliorating not only the pancreatic function and insulin sensitivity but also prevent atherogenesis and thus cardiovascular complications in diabetics. Materials and methods: Confluent human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to a 15mM high glucose media with (HGL) or without (HG) 100nM of liraglutide. Controls were kept in a 5mM normal glucose media with (NGL) or without (NG) 100nM liraglutide with 10mM of mannitol for osmotic balance. After 12 hours of exposure to the hyperglycaemic media proteins from all the conditions were extracted. Protein analysis was conducted by western blotting. Results: HuVEC cells exposed to hg media lead to a significant (*p<0.01) up regulation of all the ER stress markers as detailed: PDI calnexin BiP Ero1- Lalpha IRE1 phospho-eIF2alpha compared to cells treated with ng. However in cells exposed to hg and liraglutide there was a significant reduction in ER stress protein expression levels compared to hg alone (PDI BiP Ero1-Lalpha IRE1 phospho-eIF2alpha: p<0.01; calnexin p<0.05) in HUVEC cells treated with and high glucose. Liraglutide had no additional effects on the basal expression of ER stress markers in normal glucose compared to control. Conclusion: Our in vitro data demonstrates that liraglutide significantly down-regulates ER stress markers in endothelial cells exposed to high glucose levels. This study indicates that liraglutide has additional beneficial effects to reduce ER stress and may support prevention of atherogenesis and thus cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-010-1872-z","SUPPL. 1","S518","53","0012-186X",1423,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Because the entire gut mucosal entero-endocrine and motor functions are integrated by the enteric nervous system the aim of the present study was to investigate if prolonged intraperitoneal salsolinol administration alters basic metabolism and nutritional parameters in adult Wistar rats fed normal or high-fat diets. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to continuous intraperitoneal low dosing of salsolinol with ALZET osmotic mini-pumps for 2 or 4 weeks and fed either a normal or high-fat diet. Appropriate groups served as the controls. Nutritional status (food intake body weight and epididymal fat pads weight) residual solid food in the stomach and biochemical parameters (GIP GLP-1 CRF glucose TG LDL HDL) were assessed. RESULTS: Prolonged salsolinol treatment significantly reduced total body mass and adipose tissue accumulation. The effects were more pronounced in the salsolinol-treated rats fed a high-fat diet. In salsolinol-treated rats serum postprandial GIP levels were elevated and serum postprandial GLP-1 levels were lower compared with the appropriate controls.

Because the entire gut mucosal entero-endocrine and motor functions are integrated by the enteric nervous system the aim of the present study was to investigate if prolonged intraperitoneal salsolinol administration alters basic metabolism and nutritional parameters in adult Wistar rats fed normal or high-fat diets. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to continuous intraperitoneal low dosing of salsolinol with ALZET osmotic mini-pumps for 2 or 4 weeks and fed either a normal or high-fat diet. Appropriate groups served as the controls. Nutritional status (food intake body weight and epididymal fat pads weight) residual solid food in the stomach and biochemical parameters (GIP GLP-1 CRF glucose TG LDL HDL) were assessed. RESULTS: Prolonged salsolinol treatment significantly reduced total body mass and adipose tissue accumulation. The effects were more pronounced in the salsolinol-treated rats fed a high-fat diet.

Amelioration of hyperglycemia by insulin has not been shown to improve the post-stroke outcome. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists which modulate glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion have been shown to exert cytoprotective effects by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate whether the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 could reduce glucose levels and exert protective effects after acute focal ischemia in hyperglycemic mice. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: Hyperglycemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of dextrose 15 min before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed for 60 min using an intraluminal thread. We assessed four groups: 1) normal glucose (vehicle control) 2) induced hyperglycemia (IH) 3) IH with insulin treatment and 4) IH with exendin-4 treatment. Neurovascular injuries in brains from each group were evaluated 24 h and 7 days post-ischemia. Results: Hyperglycemia significantly increased infarct volume (36.3+/- 1.20 vs. 26.9+/-1.28 P<0.001) brain edema (P<0.05) and hemorrhagic transformation compared with control (P<0.001).

Sitagliptin treatment significantly reduced the levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol NOx total cholesterol and MDA but not triglyceridess. Additionally sitagliptin markedly reversed the decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Moreover sitagliptin significantly improved the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation without affecting phenylepherine-induced contraction and sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent relaxation in isolated aortic rings.

"Kwon S. K.Kim S. J.Kim K. M.Kim H. Y.","Proximal tubular GLP-1 receptor activity is increased in CKD rat with myocardial infarction",2016,"Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation","Introduction and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor of ischemic heart disease and chronic inflammation makes atherosclerosis in the patients with CKD. Glucagon like peptidase-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that enhances insulin secretion and GLP-1 agonist is used for glycemic control in patient with type 2 diabetes. Renal GLP-1 activity is increased in the chronic kidney disease also GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1 R) activation is related with cardiovascular protection. It is not clear that renal GLP-1 R change in CKD with acute myocardial ischemia. We investigated difference of renal GLP-1 activity in the CKD rat model with ischemic reperfusion and myocardial infarction model. Methods: CKD rat model: Adult Sprague Dawley rat were used for CKD rat model with 5 animals each group. After one week of unilateral nephrectomy 2 over 3 of remnant kidney was resected. 2 and 4 weeks later renal cortical GLP-1 R activity was measured via immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Western blot band density was standardized by beta-actin band density. Ischemic reperfusion and myocardial ischemia (MI) model: For myocardial ischemia left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated 2 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy. 30 Minutes after ligation we released ligated vessel for reperfusion model and kept ligation for MI model. We did shame operation to same numbers of animals. Myocardial tissue was extracted forWestern blot analysis of GLP-1 R. Results: Proximal tubular GLP-1 R expression is increased in the CKD rat model then decreased after 4 weeks: Western blot density of GLP-1 R in the renal cortex extract showed increased activity 2 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy then decreased 4 weeks after surgery comparing with control. Relative intensity standardized by beta-actin density were 100 +/- 10.2 (control) 161.2 +/- 3.4 (2 wks p<0.05) 102.7 +/- 5.3 (4 wks) 48.6 +/- 2.9 (8 wks p<0.05) each. Immunohistochemistry findings were similar withWestern blot analysis results. Peak intensity was noted 2 weeks later then decreased after 4 weeks of surgery then stain was disappeared in 8 weeks after surgery. Myocardial GLP-1 R is increased in CKD with MI comparing with CKD with ischemic reperfusion: After 1 week of ischemic injury GLP-1 R activity in CKD with MI was significantly increased comparing with CKD with ischemic reperfusion model. Renal cortical GLP-1 R expression is increased in the CKD-MI model than CKD ischemic reperfusion: Comparing ischemic reperfusion injury Western blot band density of CKD with MI model was significantly increased (70.25 +/- 16.35 vs. 44.2 +/- 4.0 p<0.05). Conclusions: GLP-1 R expression is increased in 2 wks of CKD and CKD-MI model and it explains that GLP-1 activity is related with inflammatory response. Proximal tubular GLP-1 R expression is increased in CKD-MI model comparing with same CKD condition with ischemic reperfusion. We concluded that renal GLP-1 R activity may be associated with protective response of ischemic heart disease in CKD. Further investigation may reveal the relationship of cardio-renal inflammatory responsiveness of GLP-1 activity.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfw188.21",NA,"i428","1)","1460-2385",405,"In_database","unique"

Given that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) regulates several intracellular signaling pathways associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) metabolism we investigated the role of DPP4 in stress-related vascular senescence and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet were randomly assigned to one of non-stress and immobilized stress groups for 12weeks. Chronic stress accelerated vascular senescence and atherosclerotic plaque growth at the aortic roots. Stressed mice had increased levels of plasma DPP4 and decreased levels of plasma GLP-1 and adiponectin (APN) and adipose APN expression. Stress increased plaque macrophage infiltration neovessel density and elastin fragmentation lessened the plaque collagen content and increased the levels of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) TLR4 C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 cathepsins S and K osteopontin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha p16(INK4A) p21 and gp91phox mRNAs and/or proteins.

METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet were randomly assigned to one of non-stress and immobilized stress groups for 12weeks. Chronic stress accelerated vascular senescence and atherosclerotic plaque growth at the aortic roots. Stressed mice had increased levels of plasma DPP4 and decreased levels of plasma GLP-1 and adiponectin (APN) and adipose APN expression. Stress increased plaque macrophage infiltration neovessel density and elastin fragmentation lessened the plaque collagen content and increased the levels of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) TLR4 C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 cathepsins S and K osteopontin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha p16(INK4A) p21 and gp91phox mRNAs and/or proteins. Stressed aortas had also increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 activities. DPP4 inhibition with anagliptin reversed stress-related atherosclerotic lesion formation and this benefit was abrogated by APN blocking. In vitro the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide stimulated APN expression in 3T3-L1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the DPP4 inhibition-mediated benefits are likely attributable at least in part to attenuation of plaque inflammation oxidative stress and proteolysis associated with GLP-1-mediated APN production in ApoE(-/-) mice under stress.

We investigated the possibility that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) can prevent the development of atherosclerosis in Apoe (-/-) mice. METHODS: Apoe (-/-) mice (17 weeks old) were administered GLP-1(7-36)amide GLP-1(9-36)amide GIP(1-42) or GIP(3-42) for 4 weeks. Aortic atherosclerosis oxidised LDL-induced foam cell formation and related gene expression in exudate peritoneal macrophages were determined. RESULTS: Administration of GLP-1(7-36)amide or GIP(1-42) significantly suppressed atherosclerotic lesions and macrophage infiltration in the aortic wall compared with vehicle controls.

The anti-atherosclerotic effects of GLP-1(7-36)amide and GIP(1-42) were associated with significant decreases in foam cell formation and downregulation of CD36 and acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) in macrophages.

W.","Liraglutide inhibits endothelial cell dysfunction and expression of vascular adhesion molecules in an ApoE mouse model of atherogenesis",2010,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone known to potentiate insulin and lower glucagon secretion. Recently the once daily GLP-1 analogue liraglutide has been approved as a new treatment for type 2 diabetes. Most importantly liraglutide improves glycaemic control and lowers body weight. We have previously shown that liraglutide attenuates TNFalpha and mild hyperglycemia (10mmol/l)-mediated induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells (hVEC's).

The aim of the current study was to determine whether liraglutide was vaso-protective in the nondiabetic ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of ECD and atherosclerosis and establish the dependence of this effect on the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Materials and methods: In vitro studies: ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein levels were determined in conditioned medium from C11-STH hVEC's treated with TNFalpha (10ng/ml) alone or TNFalpha + liraglutide (100nM) or TNFalpha + liraglutide +exendin (9-39)(100nM) for 16hrs using ELISA kits. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. In vivo studies: ApoE<sup>-/ -</sup> mice were fed a high fat diet for 16 weeks. Chronic liraglutide treatment was administered in the final 4 weeks via subcutaneous twice daily injection (total of 300mug/kg/day). Treatments included: saline (vehicle; s.c. injection twice daily) liraglutide (s.c. injection of 150mug/ kg twice daily) liraglutide + exendin (9-39) a GLP-1R antagonist (150pmol/ kg/min via osmotic mini-pump). Post-treatment the abdominal aorta was divided into four aortic rings per mouse (~3mm long). Concentration response curves to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) were constructed in preconstricted aortic rings. Results: In vitro TNFalpha induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expression in C11-STH hVEC's at 16 hrs. This effect was significantly inhibited by the addition of liraglutide. The inhibitory effect of liraglutide on TNFalpha induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was attenuated by concomitant addition of exendin (9-39). Following these experiments ex vivo organ bath studies using isolated aortic rings taken from ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a high fat diet treated with liraglutide for 4 weeks demonstrated a significant improvement in endothelial function with liraglutide compared with vehicle treated mice (max relaxation: liraglutide R<inf>max</inf> = 78.45+/-2.5% vs 55.36+/-6.89%; P<0.01; 2-way ANOVA).

K.Fathi A.Wang Q.","Cardiovascular benefits of native GLP-1 and its metabolites: An indicator for GLP-1-therapy strategies",2017,"Frontiers in Physiology","Cardiovascular disease is a common co-morbidity and leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a peptide hormone produced by intestinal L cells in response to feeding. Native GLP-1 (7-36) amide is rapidly degraded by diaminopeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) to GLP-1 (9-36) amide making 9-36a the major circulating form. While it is 7-36a and not its metabolites which exerts trophic effects on islet beta-cells recent studies suggest that both 7-36a and its metabolites have direct cardiovascular effects including preserving cardiomyocyte viability ameliorating cardiac function and vasodilation. In particular the difference in cardiovascular effects between 7-36a and 9-36a is attracting attention. Growing evidence has strengthened the presumption that their cardiovascular effects are overlapping but distinct and complementary to each other; 7-36a exerts cardiovascular effects in a GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) dependent pathway whereas 9-36a does so in a GLP-1R independent pathway. GLP-1 therapies have been developed using two main strategies: DPP4-resistant GLP-1 analogs/GLP-1R agonists and DPP4 inhibitors which both aim to prolong the life-time of circulating 7-36a. One prominent concern that should be addressed is that the cardiovascular benefits of 9-36a are lacking in these strategies. This review attempts to differentiate the cardiovascular effects between 7-36a and 9-36a in order to provide new insights into GLP-1 physiology and facilitate our efforts to develop a superior GLP-1-therapy strategy for T2DM and cardiovascular diseases.

Herein we investigated the effects of long-term treatment with canagliflozin on biochemical and immunohistochemical markers related to atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis development in the aorta of apolipoprotein E knockout (Apo-E<sup>(-/-)</sup>) mice. Methods: At the age of 5-weeks mice were switched from normal to a high-fat diet. After 5-weeks Apo-E<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice were divided into control-group (6 mice) treated with 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Cana-group (7 mice) treated with canagliflozin (10-mg/kg per day) per os. After 5-weeks of intervention animals were sacrificed and heart and aorta were removed. Sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) were used for histomorphometry whereas Masson's stained tissues were used to quantify the collagen content. Immunohistochemistry to assess MCP-1 CD68 a-smooth muscle actin MMP-2 MMP-9 TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression was carried out and q-PCR experiments were performed to quantify mRNA expression. Results: Canagliflozin-group mice had lower total-cholesterol triglycerides and glucose levels (P<0.01) while heart rate was significantly lower (P<0.05). Histomorphometry revealed that one in seven Cana-group mice versus four in six control mice developed atheromatosis while aortic root plaque was significantly less and collagen was 1.6 times more intense in canagliflozin-group suggesting increased plaque stability. Immunohistochemistry revealed that MCP-1 was significantly less expressed (P<0.05) in the aortic root of canagliflozin-group while reduced expression of a-actin and CD68 was not reaching significance (P=0.15).

The inhibitory effect of liraglutide on TNFalpha induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was significantly attenuated by concomitant addition of 100nM of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-9.

In this study we evaluated the effect of liraglutide in obese pro-atherosclerotic LDLr-/- on the development of atherosclerosis and inflammation. Materials and methods: Male LDLr-/- mice (6-8 weeks JAX USA) on western diet D12049B Research Diets USA) were divided into two groups (n=15-20/group) having a control vehicle (VEH) and a group treated with liraglutide (LIRA) 1mg/kg SC once daily for 17 weeks. At termination a predefined section of thoracic aorta was excised and plaque lesion area was quantified by the En Face method (VisioMorph Denmark). Subsequently quantitave gene expression analysis was performed on N2 frozen aortic tissue applying the Nanostring technology. Plasma cholesterol lipoproteins and triglycerides (TG) were determined by HPLC. Body weight and 24 hour food intake was monitored throughout the study. Data are presented as mean+/-sem. Results: Treatment with LIRA showed a lower body weight at all-time points as compared to the VEH group. At termination the vehicle control animals had gained 65% in body weight whereas the LIRA group only gained 17% resulting in a significant lower body weight at termination (VEH: 43.5+/-1.1g vs. LIRA: 30.9+/-0.9g; p<0.0001). Feeding with WD showed a robust acceleration in aortic plaque lesion in the VEH whereas treatment with LIRA resulted in a significant suppression of plaque lesion development (VEH: 13+/-1.0% vs. LIRA: 2.8+/-0.9%; p<0.0001). These beneficial effects by LIRA were also reflected on plasma lipids showing a significant reduction in plasma TG (VEH: 11.5+/-0.7mMvs. LIRA: 7.1+/-1.0mM; p<0.0001) vLDL (VEH: 25.9+/-2.2mM vs. LIRA: 9.6+/-2.4mM; p<0.0001) LDL (VEH: 36.3 +/-18.3mM vs. LIRA: 18.3+/-2.1%; p<0.0001) and an increase in HDL (VEH: 1.9+/-0.2mM vs. LIRA: 3.5+/-0.2; p<0.0001).

Conference: American Heart Association/American Stroke Association","Introduction: Focal cerebral cortical infarction causes beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and secondary neuronal degeneration in the ipsilateral thalamus. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of liraglutide a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue on Abeta deposits and secondary neuron damage in thalamus after cerebral infarction. Methods: Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and then randomly divided into liraglutide and vehicle groups and 8 sham-operated rats as control. At 1 hour after MCAO rats were subcutaneously injected with liraglutide (100 mug/kg/d) and isopyknic vehicle respectively then continuously injected once a day for 7 days. Sensory function and secondary thalamic damage were assessed with adhesive-removal test Nissl staining and immunostaining. Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining and Western blot were employed to detect the neuronal apoptosis at 7 days after MCAO. Results: At 7 days after MCAO liraglutide decreased the mean time of adhesive-removal at left forepaw compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.05). Treatment with liraglutide reduced Abeta deposition compared with that in the vehicle group (P < 0.05). The number of intact neurons in the ipsilateral thalamus was decreased compared with the control group at 7 days post-MCAO liraglutide significantly improved the number of intact neurons compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.05). Liraglutide decreased the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive area and the number of ionized calcium bindingadaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1)-positive cells in the ipsilateral thalamus compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.05).

Herein we investigated the effects of long-term treatment with canagliflozin on biochemical and immunohistochemical markers related to atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis development in the aorta of apolipoprotein E knockout (Apo-E((-/-))) mice. METHODS: At the age of 5 weeks mice were switched from normal to a high-fat diet. After 5 weeks Apo-E((-/-)) mice were divided into control-group (6 mice) treated with 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Cana-group (7 mice) treated with canagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day) per os. After 5 weeks of intervention animals were sacrificed and heart and aorta were removed. Sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) were used for histomorphometry whereas Masson's stained tissues were used to quantify the collagen content. Immunohistochemistry to assess MCP-1 CD68 a-smooth muscle actin MMP-2 MMP-9 TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression was carried out and q-PCR experiments were performed to quantify mRNA expression. RESULTS: Canagliflozin-group mice had lower total-cholesterol triglycerides and glucose levels (P < 0.01) while heart rate was significantly lower (P < 0.05). Histomorphometry revealed that one in seven Cana-group mice versus four in six control mice developed atheromatosis while aortic root plaque was significantly less and collagen was 1.6 times more intense in canagliflozin-group suggesting increased plaque stability. Immunohistochemistry revealed that MCP-1 was significantly less expressed (P < 0.05) in the aortic root of canagliflozin-group while reduced expression of a-actin and CD68 was not reaching significance (P = 0.15). VCAM-1 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were lower (P = 0.02 and P = 0.07 respectively) while TIMP-1/MMP-2 ratio expression was higher in canagliflozin-group approaching statistical significance (P = 0.07).

Several of these peptides are in clinical trials for stroke. Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is a proglucagon-derived peptide that co-activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR). The neuroprotective action of OXM however has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study the neuroprotective effect of OXM was first examined in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells and rat primary cortical neurons. GLP-1R and GCGR antagonists and inhibitors of various signaling pathways were used in cell culture to characterize the mechanisms of action of OXM. To evaluate translation in vivo OXM-mediated neuroprotection was assessed in a 60-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) rat model of stroke. We found that OXM dose- and time-dependently increased cell viability and protected cells from glutamate toxicity and oxidative stress. These neuroprotective actions of OXM were mainly mediated through the GLP-1R. OXM induced intracellular cAMP production and activated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Furthermore inhibition of the PKA and MAPK pathways but not inhibition of the PI3K pathway significantly attenuated the OXM neuroprotective actions. Intracerebroventricular administration of OXM significantly reduced cerebral infarct size and improved locomotor activities in MCAo stroke rats.

Our study aimed to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on atherosclerosis in diabetic ApoE-/- mice. Methods: Aortic atherosclerosis was induced in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic ApoE-/- mice (n=40) by feeding with a high-fat diet and dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg/d) was administrated in tragastrically for 12 weeks as a treatment. C57BL/6 J mice (n=6) served as controls. The effects of dapagliflozin on indices of glucose metabolism were measured and the influences of dapagliflozin on aortic atherosclerosis were evaluated by oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Moreover we also measured the serum and tissue IL-1beta and IL-18 levels and NLRP3 protein levels for subsequent mechanistic analyses. Results: Dapagliflozin treatment had beneficial effects on glucose and fat metabolism as indicated by the decreased serum blood fasting glucose free fatty acids and triglycerides. Moreover dapagliflozin partially reversed the formation of aortic atherosclerosis inhibited macrophage infiltration and enhanced the stability of lesions. Additionally it reduced IL-1beta IL-18 and NLRP3 protein in both the plasma and the aortic tissues which indicated that the benefits of dapagliflozin in diabetic atherosclerosis may be associated with an inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Conclusions: Dapagliflozin may have therapeutic potential for diabetic atherosclerosis induced by high-fat diet and these benefits may be mediated by the inhibitory effect on the NLRP3 inflammasome.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.2855","Supplement 2","25-26","32","1520-7560",1137,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Methods: Aortic atherosclerosis was induced in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (n=40) by feeding with a high-fat diet and dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg/d) was administrated in tragastrically for 12 weeks as a treatment. C57BL/6 J mice (n=6) served as controls. The effects of dapagliflozin on indices of glucose metabolism were measured and the influences of dapagliflozin on aortic atherosclerosis were evaluated by oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Moreover we also measured the serum and tissue IL-1beta and IL-18 levels and NLRP3 protein levels for subsequent mechanistic analyses. Results: Dapagliflozin treatment had beneficial effects on glucose and fat metabolism as indicated by the decreased serum blood fasting glucose free fatty acids and triglycerides. Moreover dapagliflozin partially reversed the formation of aortic atherosclerosis inhibited macrophage infiltration and enhanced the stability of lesions. Additionally it reduced IL-1beta IL-18 and NLRP3 protein in both the plasma and the aortic tissues which indicated that the benefits of dapagliflozin in diabetic atherosclerosis may be associated with an inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

As a control we inserted b-galactosidase cDNA in the same vector (rAd-bGAL).

After 3 weeks the NS + rAd-bGAL group showed the highest intima-media ratio (IMR; 3.73 +/- 0.90) the exenatide + rAd-bGAL treatment was the next highest (2.80 +/- 0.51) and NS + rAd-GLP-1 treatment showed the lowest IMR (1.58 +/- 0.48 P < 0.05 vs. others). The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and monocyte adhesion were decreased significantly after rAd-GLP-1 treatment showing the same overall patterns as the IMR.

Furthermore empagliflozin significantly prevented the impairment of cognitive function in db/db mice which was associated with the attenuation of cerebral oxidative stress and the increase in cerebral brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Empagliflozin ameliorated albuminuria and glomerular injury in db/db mice. Conclusions: Glycemic control with empagliflozin significantly ameliorated cardiovascular injury and remodeling vascular dysfunction and cognitive decline in obese and type 2 diabetic mice.

We hypothesized that chronic treatment with GLP-1 or the exenatide analog AC3174 would improve cardiac function cardiac remodeling insulin sensitivity and exercise capacity (EC) in rats with MI-induced chronic heart failure (CHF) caused by coronary artery ligation. METHODS: Two weeks post-MI male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with GLP-1 (2.5 or 25 pmol/kg/min) AC3174 (1.7 or 5 pmol/kg/min) or vehicle via subcutaneous infusion for 11 weeks. Cardiac function and morphology were assessed by echocardiography during treatment. Metabolic hemodynamic exercise-capacity and body composition measurements were made at study end. RESULTS: Compared with vehicle-treated rats with CHF GLP-1 or AC3174 significantly improved cardiac function including left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and end diastolic pressure. Cardiac dimensions also improved as evidenced by reduced LV end diastolic and systolic volumes and reduced left atrial volume. Vehicle-treated CHF rats exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. In contrast GLP-1 or AC3174 normalized fasting plasma insulin and glucose levels. GLP-1 or AC3174 also significantly reduced body fat and fluid mass and improved exercise capacity and respiratory efficiency. Four of 16 vehicle control CHF rats died during the study compared with 1 of 44 rats treated with GLP-1 or AC3174. The cellular mechanism by which GLP-1 or AC3174 exert cardioprotective effects appears unrelated to changes in GLUT1 or GLUT4 translocation or expression. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic treatment with either GLP-1 or AC3174 showed promising cardioprotective effects in a rat model of CHF.

"Lojda Z.","The histochemical demonstration of peptidases by natural substrates",1979,"Histochemistry","Methods for the demonstration of peptidase activities 'in situ' using natural peptides as substrates are described and evaluated. They are based on the use of the L-amino acid oxidase of Vipera ammodytes venom. There are two possible methods: a) the method using L-amino acid oxidase-phenazonium methosulphate and NitroBT (AAO-PMS-NBT method) which works in the pH range 6.5-8 and requires anaerobic conditions; and b) the method using L-amino acid oxidase-peroxidase- 33'-diamino benzidine hydrochloride (AAO-PO-DAB method) which works in the pH range 6-9 and requires aerobic conditions. The method furnishes similar information as the preceding one however it is less sensitive and enables histological localization only. The suitability of these methods was shown among others on the demonstration of peptidase of the gastrointestinal tract and of the arterial wall. Biochemical findings reported so far were not only confirmed but entirely new data ascertained. In the human and rat intestinal mucosa the bulk of activities directed towards dipeptides (Leu-Leu Leu-Gly Gly-Leu Ser-Met) is soluble. Peptidases splitting Leu-Leu-Leu are somewhat more structure bound in the human than in the rat intestine. Activities of these peptidases which are present even in crypt enterocytes increase during the process of the differentiation of enterocytes so that enterocytes covering sites and tops of villi display the highest staining intensity. The contribution of cells of the propria to the overall activity of the mucosa of the small intestine is not decisive. As against aminopeptidases A and M dipetidyl peptidase IV and endopeptidase enzymes splitting natural di- and tripeptides can be demonstrated also in the gastric epithelium. However in enterocytes the corresponding activity (activities) is (are) substantially higher already in the duodenal bulb. The differences in the staining intensity between gastric epithelium and enterocytes are lower in the case when Ser-Met is used as substrate than in the case when Leu-Leu Gly-Leu Leu-Gly and Leu-Leu-Leu are used as substrates. In patients suffering coeliac sprue the activity of peptidases residing in enterocytes splitting the substrates given above is lower in the acute stage of the disease than in normal persons.

Conference: American Heart Association","Background: Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction during atherogenesis is evidenced by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased nitroxidative (ONOO-) stress. We hypothesized that saxagliptin a DPP4 inhibitor would reverse EC dysfunction and reduce atheroma development by enhancing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. To test this hypothesis we measured the effects of saxagliptin on EC function in CETP-ApoB100 transgenic mice maintained on a high-fat diet. Changes in NO and ONOO- release were correlated with atherosclerotic lesion development glucose control and eNOS expression. Methods: CETP-ApoB100 transgenic mice were treated with vehicle (animals exposed to low-fat and high-fat diets) or saxagliptin (10 mg/kg/day) for 26 weeks. NO and ONOO- release from aortic and glomerular ECs was measured ex vivo using amperometric nanosensors and correlated with fasting and postprandial glucose levels. eNOS expression was measured by real-time PCR (qPCR). The development of atherosclerotic lesions was evaluated by en face Oil Red O staining of aortic sections isolated from representative animals. Results: As compared to the low-fat diet the administration of a high-fat diet for 26 weeks resulted in a 50% reduction in aortic and glomerular NO/ONOO- ratio an indicator of eNOS uncoupling. Animals fed a high-fat diet were also found to have an increased number of aortic surface atherosclerotic lesions as compared to animals in the low-fat control group (p<0.05). Saxagliptin treatment increased the maximal release of NO in aortic ECs by 18% (203 +/- 16 nM to 239 +/- 14 nM) and the overall NO/ONOO- ratio by 25% (p<0.01) due to a concomitant reduction in ONOO- levels. Similar changes were observed in glomerular ECs following saxagliptin treatment. Saxagliptin also reduced aortic lesion areas by more than 50%. The effects of saxagliptin on NO release and lesion development were not associated with changes in eNOS expression or postprandial glucose levels. Conclusion: Saxagliptin treatment reversed endothelial dysfunction and reduced atherosclerotic lesion area in a transgenic mouse model of human atherosclerosis.

Conference: American Heart Association","Background: Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction during atherogenesis is evidenced by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased nitroxidative (ONOO-) stress. We hypothesized that saxagliptin a DPP4 inhibitor would reverse EC dysfunction and reduce atheroma development by enhancing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. To test this hypothesis we measured the effects of saxagliptin on EC function in CETP-ApoB100 transgenic mice maintained on a high-fat diet. Changes in NO and ONOO- release were correlated with atherosclerotic lesion development glucose control and eNOS expression. Methods: CETP-ApoB100 transgenic mice were treated with vehicle (animals exposed to low-fat and high-fat diets) or saxagliptin (10 mg/kg/day) for 26 weeks. NO and ONOO- release from aortic and glomerular ECs was measured ex vivo using amperometric nanosensors and correlated with fasting and postprandial glucose levels. eNOS expression was measured by real-time PCR (qPCR). The development of atherosclerotic lesions was evaluated by en face Oil Red O staining of aortic sections isolated from representative animals. Results: As compared to the low-fat diet the administration of a high-fat diet for 26 weeks resulted in a 50% reduction in aortic and glomerular NO/ONOO- ratio an indicator of eNOS uncoupling. Animals fed a high-fat diet were also found to have an increased number of aortic surface atherosclerotic lesions as compared to animals in the low-fat control group (p<0.05). Saxagliptin treatment increased the maximal release of NO in aortic ECs by 18% (203 +/- 16 nM to 239 +/- 14 nM) and the overall NO/ONOO- ratio by 25% (p<0.01) due to a concomitant reduction in ONOO- levels. Similar changes were observed in glomerular ECs following saxagliptin treatment. Saxagliptin also reduced aortic lesion areas by more than 50%.

"Darsalia V.Olverling A.Nystrom T.Ortsater H.Rosenbrock H.Sjoholm A.Klein T.Patrone C.","Insights into the mechanism of action of linagliptin in reducing ischaemic brain damage following stroke in diabetic and non-diabetic mice",2013,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong risk factor for stroke. Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor in clinical use for the treatment of T2D. We recently demonstrated that linagliptin had superior neuroprotective efficacy to glimepiride in a stroke animal model in both normal and diabetic mice. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of linagliptin and glimepiride treatment on adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. Additional experiments were conducted to determine if linagliptin's neuroprotective effect was mediated via increased glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 levels in the brain. Materials and methods: C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 32 weeks to induce T2D. Mice were treated for 7 weeks with either linagliptin (10 mg/kg) or glimepiride (2 mg/kg). Stroke was induced at Week 4 of treatment by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Blood DPP-4 activity GLP-1 and glucose levels were assessed throughout the experiments. Ischaemic brain damage was measured by determining stroke volume and by stereological quantification of surviving neurons in striatum/cortex. Strokeinduced adult neural stem cell proliferation and neuroblast formation were assessed by quantifying Ki67 and doublecortin-positive cells respectively. Striatal neurogenesis and gliogenesis were assessed by quantifying BrdU/ NeuN- and BrdU/S100-positive cells respectively. Neuroinflammation was assessed by quantifying Iba-1-positive microglial cells in striatum and cortex using stereological methods. GLP-1 levels in the brain were quantified after perfusion by ELISA in naive mice treated with vehicle or linagliptin. Results: Anti-stroke efficacy of linagliptin was shown in both diabetic and normal mice whereas glimepiride was efficacious against stroke in normal mice only. These results suggest a linagliptin-mediated neuroprotective effect that is glucose-independent and may involve increased GLP-1 levels both in the blood and brain. Additional studies demonstrated that linagliptin treatment increased levels of active GLP-1 in the brain. Furthermore adult neural stem cell proliferation increased in linagliptin-treated diabetic mice compared with glimepiride and vehicle controls. Interestingly no differences between the treatment groups were observed in normal mice. Neuroblast formation neurogenesis and gliogenesis were unaffected between the groups. Thus because anti-stroke efficacy by linagliptin was achieved in both normal and diabetic mice no correlation was found between neural stem cell activation and linagliptin-mediated anti-stroke efficacy. Finally no regulation of brain inflammation was observed with either linagliptin or glimepiride. Conclusion: The mechanism of action at the basis of linagliptin's anti-stroke efficacy requires further study.

"Darsalia V.Olverling A.Nystrom T.Ortsater H.Rosenbrock H.Sjoholm A.Klein T.Patrone C.","Insights into the mechanism of action of linagliptin in reducing ischaemic brain damage following stroke in diabetic and non-diabetic mice",2013,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong risk factor for stroke. Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor in clinical use for the treatment of T2D. We recently demonstrated that linagliptin had superior neuroprotective efficacy to glimepiride in a stroke animal model in both normal and diabetic mice. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of linagliptin and glimepiride treatment on adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. Additional experiments were conducted to determine if linagliptin's neuroprotective effect was mediated via increased glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 levels in the brain. Materials and methods: C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 32 weeks to induce T2D. Mice were treated for 7 weeks with either linagliptin (10 mg/kg) or glimepiride (2 mg/kg). Stroke was induced at Week 4 of treatment by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Blood DPP-4 activity GLP-1 and glucose levels were assessed throughout the experiments. Ischaemic brain damage was measured by determining stroke volume and by stereological quantification of surviving neurons in striatum/cortex. Strokeinduced adult neural stem cell proliferation and neuroblast formation were assessed by quantifying Ki67 and doublecortin-positive cells respectively. Striatal neurogenesis and gliogenesis were assessed by quantifying BrdU/ NeuN- and BrdU/S100-positive cells respectively. Neuroinflammation was assessed by quantifying Iba-1-positive microglial cells in striatum and cortex using stereological methods. GLP-1 levels in the brain were quantified after perfusion by ELISA in naive mice treated with vehicle or linagliptin. Results: Anti-stroke efficacy of linagliptin was shown in both diabetic and normal mice whereas glimepiride was efficacious against stroke in normal mice only. These results suggest a linagliptin-mediated neuroprotective effect that is glucose-independent and may involve increased GLP-1 levels both in the blood and brain. Additional studies demonstrated that linagliptin treatment increased levels of active GLP-1 in the brain. Furthermore adult neural stem cell proliferation increased in linagliptin-treated diabetic mice compared with glimepiride and vehicle controls. Interestingly no differences between the treatment groups were observed in normal mice. Neuroblast formation neurogenesis and gliogenesis were unaffected between the groups. Thus because anti-stroke efficacy by linagliptin was achieved in both normal and diabetic mice no correlation was found between neural stem cell activation and linagliptin-mediated anti-stroke efficacy. Finally no regulation of brain inflammation was observed with either linagliptin or glimepiride. Conclusion: The mechanism of action at the basis of linagliptin's anti-stroke efficacy requires further study. However if translated to humans our findings may provide a basis for the use of DPP-4 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of stroke in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Moreover we hypothesise that diabetic patients at high risk for stroke may derive further benefit because of the increased proliferation of stem cells.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-013-3012-z","SUPPL. 1","S69","56","0012-186X",1299,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Recent studies suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors which are novel class of glucoselowering agents reduce cardiovascular events in T2D patients with high risk of CVD. However it remains uncertain whether the cardiovascular benefits merely depend on glucose-lowering effects or some other mechanism( s). Therefore we examined whether empagliflozin suppressed the progression of atherosclerosis in diabetic and non-diabetic Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice and whether it had direct anti-atherogenic effects in macrophages. Materials and methods: Apoe-/- mice (12 weeks age) were fed normal chow (NC) or a high fat diet (HFD) or treated with streptozotocin (120 mg/kg) and further treated with a placebo or empagliflozin (5 mg/ kg/day) for 8 weeks. Mouse peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were used for in vitro experiments. Atherosclerotic lesion size of aortic sinus and en face of aorta were estimated by oil-reo-O staining. Expression of 4-HNE F4/80 Ki67 and Iba1 were visualized by fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Expression of SGLT2 MCP-1 and TNF-alpha were performed by Real-time RT-PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Intracellular ROS generation was measured by H2DCF-DA. Cell proliferation was estimated by a CCK-8 assay kit and direct counting of the live cell number. Membrane currents of macrophages were performed by patch clump measurements. Results: In all mouse models there were no significant differences on dietary intake and lipid profile between placebo and empagliflozin-treated groups. However body weight was lower in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group in NC-fed mice. Glucose levels during a food load test were lower in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group in all mouse models. Treatment with empagliflozin suppressed the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus and en face of the whole aorta in all mouse models. The 4-HNE-positive area and number of proliferating macrophages in plaques and mRNA expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha in the aorta were lower in empagliflozin groups than in control groups. Expression of SGLT2 mRNA and protein were confirmed in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Empagliflozin inhibited LPS-induced ROS generation MCP-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression and GM-CSF-induced cell proliferation as well as suppressed glucose-sensitive inward current and glucose uptake in macrophages. Moreover a pan-glucose transporter inhibitor or sodium channel blocker suppressed macrophage proliferation suggesting the involvement of SGLT2 for macrophage activation. Conclusion: We revealed that treatment with empagliflozin suppresses the progression of atherosclerosis in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic Apoe-/- mice. Moreover we revealed for the first time that macrophages express functional SGLT2 and empagliflozin directly suppresses ROS generation inflammatory responses and cell growth of macrophages. These actions of empagliflozin may indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors may be beneficial for the treatment of diabetic macrovascular complications and SGLT2 in macrophages may be a therapeutic target in normoglycemic patients with atherosclerotic diseases.",NA,NA,"S10-S11","61","0012-186X",1567,"In_database","duplicate"

Recent studies suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors which are novel class of glucoselowering agents reduce cardiovascular events in T2D patients with high risk of CVD. However it remains uncertain whether the cardiovascular benefits merely depend on glucose-lowering effects or some other mechanism( s). Therefore we examined whether empagliflozin suppressed the progression of atherosclerosis in diabetic and non-diabetic Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice and whether it had direct anti-atherogenic effects in macrophages. Materials and methods: Apoe-/- mice (12 weeks age) were fed normal chow (NC) or a high fat diet (HFD) or treated with streptozotocin (120 mg/kg) and further treated with a placebo or empagliflozin (5 mg/ kg/day) for 8 weeks. Mouse peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were used for in vitro experiments. Atherosclerotic lesion size of aortic sinus and en face of aorta were estimated by oil-reo-O staining. Expression of 4-HNE F4/80 Ki67 and Iba1 were visualized by fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Expression of SGLT2 MCP-1 and TNF-alpha were performed by Real-time RT-PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Intracellular ROS generation was measured by H2DCF-DA. Cell proliferation was estimated by a CCK-8 assay kit and direct counting of the live cell number. Membrane currents of macrophages were performed by patch clump measurements. Results: In all mouse models there were no significant differences on dietary intake and lipid profile between placebo and empagliflozin-treated groups. However body weight was lower in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group in NC-fed mice. Glucose levels during a food load test were lower in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group in all mouse models. Treatment with empagliflozin suppressed the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus and en face of the whole aorta in all mouse models. The 4-HNE-positive area and number of proliferating macrophages in plaques and mRNA expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha in the aorta were lower in empagliflozin groups than in control groups. Expression of SGLT2 mRNA and protein were confirmed in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Empagliflozin inhibited LPS-induced ROS generation MCP-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression and GM-CSF-induced cell proliferation as well as suppressed glucose-sensitive inward current and glucose uptake in macrophages. Moreover a pan-glucose transporter inhibitor or sodium channel blocker suppressed macrophage proliferation suggesting the involvement of SGLT2 for macrophage activation. Conclusion: We revealed that treatment with empagliflozin suppresses the progression of atherosclerosis in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic Apoe-/- mice. Moreover we revealed for the first time that macrophages express functional SGLT2 and empagliflozin directly suppresses ROS generation inflammatory responses and cell growth of macrophages. These actions of empagliflozin may indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors may be beneficial for the treatment of diabetic macrovascular complications and SGLT2 in macrophages may be a therapeutic target in normoglycemic patients with atherosclerotic diseases.",NA,NA,"S10-S11","61","0012-186X",1739,"In_database","duplicate"

A.","Animal models of catheter-induced intimal hyperplasia in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the effects of pharmacologic intervention",2009,"Can J Physiol Pharmacol","Diabetes is a complex disorder characterized by impaired insulin formation release or action (insulin resistance) elevated blood glucose and multiple long-term complications. It is a common endocrine disorder of humans and is associated with abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. There are two forms of diabetes classified as type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes hyperglycemia is due to an absolute lack of insulin whereas in type 2 diabetes hyper- glycemia is due to a relative lack of insulin and insulin resistance. More than 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 with varied degrees of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is often associated with impaired insulin secretion and hyper- glycemia is a common feature in both types of diabetes but failure to make a distinction between the types of diabetes in different animal models has led to confusion in the literature. This is particularly true in relation to cardiovascular disease in the presence of diabetes and especially the response to vascular injury in which there are major differences between the two types of diabetes. Animal models do not completely mimic the clinical disease seen in humans. Animal models are at best analogies of the pathologic process they are designed to represent.

It is a common endocrine disorder of humans and is associated with abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. There are two forms of diabetes classified as type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes hyperglycemia is due to an absolute lack of insulin whereas in type 2 diabetes hyper- glycemia is due to a relative lack of insulin and insulin resistance. More than 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 with varied degrees of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is often associated with impaired insulin secretion and hyper- glycemia is a common feature in both types of diabetes but failure to make a distinction between the types of diabetes in different animal models has led to confusion in the literature. This is particularly true in relation to cardiovascular disease in the presence of diabetes and especially the response to vascular injury in which there are major differences between the two types of diabetes. Animal models do not completely mimic the clinical disease seen in humans. Animal models are at best analogies of the pathologic process they are designed to represent.

Initially the focus of the function of NPY in the cardiovascular system involved its acute actions such as vasoconstriction via the Y1 receptor. However recent studies have shown that NPY is a potent growth and angiogenic factor which acts on multiple receptor subtypes. To be more specific NPY-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell growth leading to neointima formation involves Y1 and Y1 receptors while the angiogenic effects of NPY include Y2 and Y5 receptor activation. The presence of dipeptidyl peptidase IV also influences the cardiovascular responses of NPY by acting as a converting enzyme shifting NPY activities away from Y1. Thus agonists and antagonists aimed at the NPY system represent a new avenue for drug treatment which may help alleviate several cardiovascular disorders in which vascular remodeling plays a major role such as atherosclerosis restenosis following balloon angioplasty hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.",NA,"9","957-62","5","1472-4472 (Print)

Herein we report the identification of 4-benzyloxybenzo[d]isoxazole-3-amine derivatives as potent and highly selective SMS2 inhibitors through a conformational restriction strategy. After systematic structural modifications several compounds with high selectivity and good potency in vitro were selected for further evaluation. Compound 15w demonstrated good pharmacokinetics (oral bioavailability F = 56%) in vivo and has an inhibitory potency against sphingomyelin synthase activity when Institute of Cancer Research mice are provided with an oral dose of this compound. In addition compound 15w attenuated chronic inflammation significantly in db/db mice after oral dosing for 6 weeks.Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00727","18","8241-8254","61","0022-2623

Several trials of stable ischemic heart disease including patients with T2DM have demonstrated that medical management is comparable to revascularization in terms of mortality and rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). There has been a growing appreciation for optimal medical therapy's (OMT) role in improving clinical outcomes.

There has been significant evolution in the development of pharmacologic management of T2DM patients. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new pharmacologic therapy with tremendous potential to alter clinical practice and influence practice guidelines. SGLT2-inhibitors have great potential in reducing MACE in patients with T2DM and CAD. Empagliflozin should be considered as a part of OMT among these patients. If results similar to the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial are replicated in other trials the use of these pharmacologic agents as a part of OMT may narrow the gap between revascularization and OMT alone in patients with T2DM and multi-vessel disease.

We have previously demonstrated enhanced functional activity in the small intestine of neonatally monosodium glutamate-treated (MSG) obese rats despite the absence of overeating and we concluded that these changes might also contribute to the development of MSG obesity. The objective of the present experiments was to investigate whether ADX would affect the small intestinal functions and whether their changes would counteract attenuation or prevention of obesity development in MSG rats. Therefore the investigation was carried out in MSG-obese Wistar male rats and untreated intact rats adrenalectomized on day 40 as well as in lean littermates of MSG rats and intact rats subjected to Sham-ADX surgery. All animals had free access to a standard pellet diet after weaning. At the age of 80 days body mass body fat content and food consumption as well as changes of the brush-border-bound duodenal and jejunal alkaline phosphatase (AP) the dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV (DPP IV) and maltase activity were measured. During the postoperative period ADX resulted in a significant decrease of mass gain in both MSG and control rats (P<0.05). ADX fully prevented the development of obesity in MSG rats (significantly decreased epididymal+retroperitoneal fat pad mass P<0.05) and increased mean daily food intake (P<0.001). These effects were only minimal in the ADX controls suggesting that enhanced adrenal secretion is involved in the expression of MSG obesity and its complications. The AP activity in obese MSG rats was increased by about 21 % (P<0.01) in both intestinal segments when compared to the lean controls whereas no parallel variations in the activities of DPP IV and maltase were observed in the intestinal parts mentioned. In MSG rats ADX significantly reduced the AP activity in the duodenum and jejunum (P<0.01). A similar tendency was also seen in the DPP IV activity of adrenalectomized MSG rats as well as in lean control rats. Nevertheless no significant effect of adrenal withdrawal on maltase activity was found. These results indicate that the decrease of enzyme activities in the small intestine and the different effectiveness of nutrient absorption might be a significant factor preventing the development of excess adiposity in glutamate-treated rats.

Methods and Results: Here we show that cardioprotective effects of a metabolite of GLP-1 namely GLP-1(28-36) are mediated by soluble adenylyl cyclase Adcy10 (sAC) expressed in mouse coronary artery smooth muscle cells (caSMC). Ex vivo and in vivo mouse models of ischemiareperfusion injury and myocardial infarction respectively revealed that GLP-1(28-36) was as cardioprotective as GLP-1 with its effect abolished by scrambling its amino-acid sequence. Pharmacological inhibitors siRNA and sAC-null mice demonstrated that GLP-1(28-36) acts directly on human and mouse caSMC resulting in sAC-dependent cytoprotection from oxidative stress injury. Next we cloned full-length GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) mRNA from a human megakaryocyte cell line (MEG-01) and found expression levels of GLP-1R in MEG-01 to be less than pancreas but more than lung. GLP-1 and the GLP-1R agonist exenatide elicited a cAMP response in MEG-01 cells and an inhibitory effect on thrombin-stimulated aggregation of human and mouse platelets. Incubation with exenatide also inhibited thrombus formation in perfusion chamber experiments with whole blood. In a cremaster artery laser injury model exenatide inhibited thrombus formation in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic mice in vivo. Thrombus formation was greater in mice transplanted with bone marrow lacking a functional GLP-1R (Glp1r- /-) as compared to wild-type bone marrow. However anti-thrombotic effects of exenatide were only partly lost in mice transplanted with bone marrow from Glp1r-/- mice.

There are 2 classes of IBTs: the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.

GLP-1 inhibits food intake and the increased GLP-1 response may contribute as a satiety signal.

This study explored whether the novel adipokine soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) can cause endothelial dysfunction an early marker of impaired vascular reactivity. METHOD: Reactivity was studied in mesenteric arteries from 3-month-old female mice using a small vessel myograph. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) release was explored in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Neither the contractility to noradrenaline nor the endothelium-independent relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside were modified by sDPP4. However sDPP4 impaired in a concentration-dependent manner the endothelium-dependent relaxation elicited by acetylcholine. The DPP4 inhibitors K579 and linagliptin prevented the defective relaxation induced by sDPP4 as did the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) inhibitor GB83. Downstream of PAR2 the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib or the thromboxane receptors blocker SQ29548 prevented the deleterious effects of sDPP4. Accordingly sDPP4 triggered the release of TXA2 by endothelial cells whereas TXA2 release was prevented by inhibiting DPP4 PAR2 or COX. CONCLUSION: In summary these findings reveal sDPP4 as a direct mediator of endothelial dysfunction acting through PAR2 activation and the release of vasoconstrictor prostanoids.

However sDPP4 impaired in a concentration-dependent manner the endothelium-dependent relaxation elicited by acetylcholine. The DPP4 inhibitors K579 and linagliptin prevented the defective relaxation induced by sDPP4 as did the proteaseactivated receptor 2 (PAR2) inhibitor GB83. Downstream of PAR2 the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib or the thromboxane receptors blocker SQ29548 prevented the deleterious effects of sDPP4. Accordingly sDPP4 triggered the release of TXA2 by endothelial cells whereas TXA2 release was prevented by inhibiting DPP4 PAR2 or COX. Conclusion: In summary these findings reveal sDPP4 as a direct mediator of endothelial dysfunction acting through PAR2 activation and the release of vasoconstrictor prostanoids. By interfering with these actions DPP4 inhibitors might help preserving endothelial function in the context of cardiometabolic diseases.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health Inc.

Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine that attracts endothelial progenitor cells and promotes angiogenesis. Therapeutic use of SDF-1 in hindlimb ischemia may be challenged by proteolytic degradation. We hypothesized that protease-resistant variants of SDF-1 can increase blood flow in an experimental model of hindlimb ischemia. Methods and Results- We screened a peptide library for mutations in SDF-1 that provide resistance to matrix metalloproteinase cleavage. Recombinant SDF-1 proteins carrying the mutations were designed expressed and purified and activity of mutant proteins was tested with receptor activation assays and in vivo Matrigel plug assays. SSDF-1(S4V) which is resistant to both dipeptidylpeptidase IV/CD26 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 cleavage was active in vitro and induced angiogenesis in vivo. We then designed and purified fusion proteins of SSDF-1 and SSDF-1(S4V) with the sequence of self-assembling peptide nanofibers for incorporation into nanofibers. In a blinded and randomized hindlimb ischemia mouse study SSDF-1(S4V) delivery by nanofibers improved blood flow as measured by laser Doppler from 23.1+/-1.9% (untreated control) to 55.1+/-5.7% 6 weeks after surgery (P<0.001). Nanofibers alone or SSDF-1 delivered by nanofibers did not improve blood flow. Furthermore SSDF-1(S4V) delivered by nanofibers increased formation of new arterioles. In vitro SSDF-1(S4V) attracts smooth muscle cells but does not induce mitosis.

Here we evaluate the association of NPY and its receptors (Rs) with human and murine atherosclerosis. Methods: In 40 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and 12 healthy volunteers vascular tissues were stained for NPY and its Rs (Y1 Y2 and Y5 immunohistochemistry) NPY-converting enzyme CD26/DPPIV and endothelial marker CD31 (immunofluorescence) and lesion characterization (H&E and Movats pentachrome). NPY immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) was measured in the platelet-poor-(PPP) and platelet-rich-(PRP) plasmas. Lard-fed Apo-E KO mice (n=25) were sacrificed at 20 weeks of age and aortic sinus lesions and PPP and PRP NPY-ir levels assessed. Results: NPY and NPY-R immunostaining was greater in the atherosclerotic lesions from PAD patients compared to normal vessels of healthy volunteers (all P<0.001) and was localized to smooth muscle cells macrophages and adventitial/neovascular endothelial cells. CD26/DPPIV staining co-localized with CD31 + positive endothelial cells only in atherosclerotic lesions. NPY-ir in PRP was higher (P<0.05) in PAD vs. healthy subjects in men but not in women. A similar gender-specific relationship was observed in mice. PRP NPY-ir levels correlated with lesion area (P=0.03) necrotic core area and the necrotic core to lesion area ratio (P values <0.01) in male mice but not in females. In both mice and humans males with neovascularized lesions had significantly higher PRP NPY-ir levels than those lacking lesion microvessels (P<0.05). Conclusions: NPY and its Rs are upregulated in human atherosclerotic lesions suggesting a possible pathogenic role. Expression of DPPIV by microvascular endothelial cells in atherosclerotic tissue may shift the affinity of NPY toward the Y2/Y5 receptors and thus enhances angiogenesis and increases lesion vulnerability. Both our animal and human data suggest that platelet NPY is an important contributor and PRP NPY-ir a marker of atherosclerotic lesion burden and vulnerability but only in males perhaps due to androgen-dependent regulation of NPY (previously reported in rats).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATV.0b013e3181eac982","11","e214","30 (11)","1079-5642",670,"In_database","unique"

Methods: In 40 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and 12 healthy volunteers vascular tissues were stained for NPY and its Rs (Y1 Y2 and Y5 immunohistochemistry) NPY-converting enzyme CD26/DPPIV and endothelial marker CD31 (immunofluorescence) and lesion characterization (H&E and Movats pentachrome). NPY immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) was measured in the platelet-poor-(PPP) and platelet-rich-(PRP) plasmas. Lard-fed Apo-E KO mice (n=25) were sacrificed at 20 weeks of age and aortic sinus lesions and PPP and PRP NPY-ir levels assessed. Results: NPY and NPY-R immunostaining was greater in the atherosclerotic lesions from PAD patients compared to normal vessels of healthy volunteers (all P<0.001) and was localized to smooth muscle cells macrophages and adventitial/neovascular endothelial cells. CD26/DPPIV staining co-localized with CD31 + positive endothelial cells only in atherosclerotic lesions. NPY-ir in PRP was higher (P<0.05) in PAD vs. healthy subjects in men but not in women. A similar gender-specific relationship was observed in mice. PRP NPY-ir levels correlated with lesion area (P=0.03) necrotic core area and the necrotic core to lesion area ratio (P values <0.01) in male mice but not in females. In both mice and humans males with neovascularized lesions had significantly higher PRP NPY-ir levels than those lacking lesion microvessels (P<0.05). Conclusions: NPY and its Rs are upregulated in human atherosclerotic lesions suggesting a possible pathogenic role. Expression of DPPIV by microvascular endothelial cells in atherosclerotic tissue may shift the affinity of NPY toward the Y2/Y5 receptors and thus enhances angiogenesis and increases lesion vulnerability. Both our animal and human data suggest that platelet NPY is an important contributor and PRP NPY-ir a marker of atherosclerotic lesion burden and vulnerability but only in males perhaps due to androgen-dependent regulation of NPY (previously reported in rats).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATV.0b013e3181eac982","11","e214","30","1079-5642",1418,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

A series of investigations using mice lacking GIPR and/or GLP-1R as well as mice lacking DPP-4 showed involvement of GIP and GLP-1 in divergent biological activities some of which could have implications for preventing diabetes-related microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (e.g. coronary artery disease peripheral artery disease and cerebrovascular disease) as well as diabetes-related comorbidity (e.g. obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease bone fracture and cognitive dysfunction). Furthermore recent studies using incretin-based drugs such as GLP-1 receptor agonists which stably activate GLP-1R signaling and DPP-4 inhibitors which enhance both GLP-1R and GIPR signaling showed that GLP-1 and GIP exert effects possibly linked to prevention or treatment of diabetes-related complications and comorbidities independently of hyperglycemia. We review recent findings on the extrapancreatic effects of GIP and GLP-1 on the heart brain kidney eye and nerves as well as in the liver fat and several organs from the perspective of diabetes-related complications and comorbidities. © 2013 Asian Association for the Study of Diabetes and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdi.12065","2","108-130","4","2040-1116

Sweet and fatty acid taste receptors (FFAR) coupled to the gustatory G-protein gustducin on enteroendocrine cells play a role in gut hormone release. We studied if supplementation of artificial (sucralose) or prebiotic (oligofructose; OFS) sweeteners target gustducin-mediated signaling pathways to alter gut hormone release and reduce obesity-associated disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type (WT) and alpha-gustducin knockout (alpha-gust(-/-) ) mice were fed a high-fat diet and gavaged once daily (8 wk) with water or equisweet concentrations of sweeteners. OFS but not sucralose decreased body weight gain (-19 +/- 3% p < 0.01) fat pad mass (-55 +/- 6% p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (-39 +/- 5% p < 0.001) independent of alpha-gustducin. Neither sweetener improved glucose intolerance while solely OFS improved the disturbed colonic permeability. OFS decreased (-65 +/- 8% p < 0.001) plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but not ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) levels in WT mice. Cecal acetate and butyrate levels were reduced by OFS in both genotypes suggesting enhanced uptake of SCFAs that may target FFAR2 (upregulated expression) in adipose tissue. CONCLUSION: OFS but not sucralose reduced body weight gain and decreased intestinal permeability but not glucose intolerance. Effects were not mediated by altered gut hormone levels or gustducin-mediated signaling. Artificial sweeteners do not affect gut hormone levels and are metabolically inert in mice on a high-fat diet. In contrast prebiotic oligosaccharides (OFS) prevent body weight gain but not glucose intolerance. Alterations in sweet and short-chain fatty acid receptors (FFAR) (studied in WT and alpha-gust(-/-) mice) that regulate gut hormone levels are not mandatory for the positive effects of OFS. Enhanced uptake of SCFAs may favor interaction with FFAR2/3 on adipose tissue to induce weight loss.","10.1002/mnfr.201600716","3",NA,"61","1613-4125",165,"In_database","unique"

In IR dyslipidemia typically include hypertriglyceridemia low high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased small and dense low density lipoprotein particles and post-prandial hyperlipidemia which play a direct or indirect role in the mechanisms of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia is mainly due to accumulation of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the liver and bowel. The bowel has traditionally been seen as a passive organ but current evidence confirms that it is an active organ subject to regulation by free fatty acids insulin incretins and inflammation. Two new concepts have emerged: intestinal IR and overproduction of chylomicrons in hyperinsulinemic/IR states.

It remains unclear whether the antiatherogenesis of DPP-4i is wholly dependent on incretins or partly initiated via direct mechanisms independent of incretins. In this study we sought to elucidate the direct action of DPP-4i on anti-atherogenesis by examining the in vitro effect of incretins and DPP-4i on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and foam cell formation in monocytes/macrophages. Materials and methods: Mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the ascites by injection of thioglycolate. Monocytes/macrophages were obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells through a CD14 column. Foam cell formation was determined by the incorporation of [3H]- oleate into cholesteryl-oleate stimulated by oxidized-LDL. Results: Exendin (Ex)-4 (5nM) and GIP (1nM) elicited cyclic (c)AMP generation and suppressed the LPS-induced gene expression of inflammatory molecules such as Interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6 TNF-alpha and nuclear factor- kappa B by 10~50% in U937 human monocytes. This suppressive effect however was attenuated by an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase and mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP or forskolin. Teneligliptin (1-10 nM) substantially suppressed the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines by 20~75% without affecting the cell viability or DNA synthesis.Similarly treatments with antibody or small interfering RNA of CD26 suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines.Teneligliptin with DPP4-resistant incretins (Ex- 4 and DAla(2)GIP) additively suppressed the expression of these cytokines. Ex-4 GIP and teneligliptin all suppressed LPS-induced extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation to the same extent. The suppression of p-ERK by incretins was cAMP-dependent while the suppression by teneligliptin was not. Teneligliptin suppressed cell surface toll-like receptor (TLR)-4-and TLR-5-mediated cytokine production but had no effect on the intracellular TRLs-induced cytokines. Ex-4 and GIP slightly suppressed foam cell formation in mouse peritoneal macrophages and human macrophages whereas teneligliptin did not. Foam cell formation was enhanced by 2-fold in peritoneal macrophages of diabetic mice (db/db) and in the macrophages of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Ex-4 GIP and teneligliptin suppressed foam cell formation in the macrophages of diabetic mice and patients by 25-50%. The gene expressions of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-1 and CD36 were up-regulated in diabetes and incretins and teneligliptin attenuated the upregulation. CD26 mRNA and transcripts corded by exons 3-13 of the GLP-1 receptor and exons 1-14 of the GIP receptor were detectable in the monocytes/macrophages of mouse and human.

However it has not been elucidated whether DPP-4 inhibitors are able to improve endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore we investigated the efficacy of the DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin (Sita) on endothelial function and glycemic metabolism compared with Glimepiride (Gli) therapy. Materials and methods: This study was a multicenter prospective randomized parallel-group comparison. Study inclusion criteria were current metformin treatment and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c levels of 6.9% to 8.4%) with sufficient control of blood pressure and lipid profile. Patients who suffered severe atherosclerosis liver damage and renal dysfunction were excluded. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) Endo PAT a comprehensive panel of hemodynamic parameters (Task Force Monitor) and serum metabolic markers were assessed before and after the 26 week treatment period. All FMD assessments were performed by the same individual in a quiet temperature- controlled setting. Patients were randomly assigned to once daily Sita (50mg) or Gli (0.5 to 2mg) therapy according to age body mass index and baseline FMD values. Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann- Whitney U test and a p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Forty-six men and thirty-three women aged 59.0 +/- 10.4 years with HbA1c levels of 7.1 +/- 0.4 % were enrolled. After 26 weeks improvements in HbA1c levels were similar between the Sita and the Gli group (p = 0.48). Contrary to expectations the observed improvements in %FMD and Endo PAT were not statistically different between groups (%FMD; Sita 5.9 to 6.0 % Gli 5.7 to 6.1 % RHI; Sita 1.9 to 2.3 Gli 2.1 to 2.3). Plasma HDL-cholesterol adiponectin and TNF-alpha levels were significantly improved in the Sita group (p < 0.05) and LDL-cholesterol also tended to be improved (p = 0.07). Blood pressure cardiac index total peripheral resistance index and most other metabolic parameters were not different. Conclusion: In type 2 diabetic patients without advanced atherosclerosis changes in endothelial function were similar between Sita and Gli groups after 26 weeks. However early Sita therapy was associated with more favorable effects on adipokine and lipid profiles compared with Gli therapy. Therefore it is probable that over the long term these beneficial changes in glycemic and lipid control will aid in the prevention of atherosclerosis.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-014-3355-0",NA,"S355-S356","1)","0012-186X",508,"In_database","unique"

Materials and methods: This study was a multicenter prospective randomized parallel-group comparison. Study inclusion criteria were current metformin treatment and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c levels of 6.9% to 8.4%) with sufficient control of blood pressure and lipid profile. Patients who suffered severe atherosclerosis liver damage and renal dysfunction were excluded. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) Endo PAT a comprehensive panel of hemodynamic parameters (Task Force Monitor) and serum metabolic markers were assessed before and after the 26 week treatment period. All FMD assessments were performed by the same individual in a quiet temperature- controlled setting. Patients were randomly assigned to once daily Sita (50mg) or Gli (0.5 to 2mg) therapy according to age body mass index and baseline FMD values. Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann- Whitney U test and a p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Forty-six men and thirty-three women aged 59.0 +/- 10.4 years with HbA1c levels of 7.1 +/- 0.4 % were enrolled. After 26 weeks improvements in HbA1c levels were similar between the Sita and the Gli group (p = 0.48). Contrary to expectations the observed improvements in %FMD and Endo PAT were not statistically different between groups (%FMD; Sita 5.9 to 6.0 % Gli 5.7 to 6.1 % RHI; Sita 1.9 to 2.3 Gli 2.1 to 2.3). Plasma HDL-cholesterol adiponectin and TNF-alpha levels were significantly improved in the Sita group (p < 0.05) and LDL-cholesterol also tended to be improved (p = 0.07). Blood pressure cardiac index total peripheral resistance index and most other metabolic parameters were not different. Conclusion: In type 2 diabetic patients without advanced atherosclerosis changes in endothelial function were similar between Sita and Gli groups after 26 weeks. However early Sita therapy was associated with more favorable effects on adipokine and lipid profiles compared with Gli therapy. Therefore it is probable that over the long term these beneficial changes in glycemic and lipid control will aid in the prevention of atherosclerosis.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-014-3355-0","1 SUPPL. 1","S355-S356","57","0012-186X",1252,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Sweet and fatty acid taste receptors (FFAR) coupled to the gustatory G-protein gustducin on enteroendocrine cells play a role in gut hormone release. We studied if supplementation of artificial (sucralose) or prebiotic (oligofructose; OFS) sweeteners target gustducin-mediated signaling pathways to alter gut hormone release and reduce obesity-associated disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type (WT) and alpha-gustducin knockout (alpha-gust-/- ) mice were fed a high-fat diet and gavaged once daily (8 wk) with water or equisweet concentrations of sweeteners. OFS but not sucralose decreased body weight gain (-19 +/- 3% p < 0.01) fat pad mass (-55 +/- 6% p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (-39 +/- 5% p < 0.001) independent of alpha-gustducin. Neither sweetener improved glucose intolerance while solely OFS improved the disturbed colonic permeability. OFS decreased (-65 +/- 8% p < 0.001) plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but not ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) levels in WT mice. Cecal acetate and butyrate levels were reduced by OFS in both genotypes suggesting enhanced uptake of SCFAs that may target FFAR2 (upregulated expression) in adipose tissue. CONCLUSION: OFS but not sucralose reduced body weight gain and decreased intestinal permeability but not glucose intolerance. Effects were not mediated by altered gut hormone levels or gustducin-mediated signaling. Artificial sweeteners do not affect gut hormone levels and are metabolically inert in mice on a high-fat diet. In contrast prebiotic oligosaccharides (OFS) prevent body weight gain but not glucose intolerance. Alterations in sweet and short-chain fatty acid receptors (FFAR) (studied in WT and alpha-gust-/- mice) that regulate gut hormone levels are not mandatory for the positive effects of OFS. Enhanced uptake of SCFAs may favor interaction with FFAR2/3 on adipose tissue to induce weight loss.Copyright © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However there is no experimental evidence presently available in the literature with regard to its ameliorating effects on diabetes mellitus coexisting with metabolic syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of MNG on various components of metabolic syndrome with diabetes as an essential component. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were fed high-fat diets for 10 weeks and challenged with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) at week three (high-fat diabetic control group). After the confirmation of metabolic syndrome in the setting of diabetes MNG 40 mg/kg was orally fed to these rats from the fourth to tenth week. RESULTS: The treatment with MNG showed beneficial effects on various components of metabolic syndrome such as reduced dyslipidemia (decreased triglyceride total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and diabetes mellitus (reduced blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin). In addition an increase in serum insulin C-peptide and homeostasis model assessment-beta and a reduction in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance-IR were observed in MNG-treated group compared with high-fat diabetic control group. MNG was also found to be cardioprotective (reduction in creatine phosphokinase-MB levels atherogenic index high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). Reduction in serum dipeptidyl peptidase-IV levels in the MNG-treated group correlated with improvement in insulin resistance and enhanced beta-cell function. CONCLUSION: The present study has demonstrated antidiabetic hypolipidemic and cardioprotective effects of MNG in the setting of diabetes with metabolic syndrome. Thus MNG has the potential to be developed as a natural alternative to synthetic dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors beneficial in this comorbid condition.","10.2147/dmso.s109599",NA,"261-72","9","1178-7007 (Print)

Conference: Experimental Biology","We compared the efficacy of switching to a low fat diet or a low fat diet supplemented with resistant starch (RS) in attenuating diet induced obesity in CD rats. This rat species exhibits two phenotypes with regard to obesity. The obese prone (OP) rats develop obesity on a high calorie diet while the obese resistant (OR) remain lean. The obesity trait in OP rats is linked to a polygenic pattern of inheritance similar to the human obese phenotype. Using isocaloric diets intake of RS that escapes digestion in the small intestine and is available to colonic microbiota reduces abdominal fat in various models of obesity by increasing energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Fermentation of RS by gut bacteria has been shown to be the mechanism involved. Using OR and OP rats we evaluated changes in the gut microbiota in relation to development of obesity and its associated comorbidities. We focused on the species Methanobrevibacter smithii the predominant archaeon in the human gut that increases fermentation and methanogenesis. Based on previous studies we hypothesized that OR rats would remain lean on a high fat diet ferment RS better than OP rats and have higher amounts of total bacteria and M. smithii when the diet includes RS. Five week old rats (OP; n=32; OR; n=32) were each stratified based on weight and insulin sensitivity into two groups. Ten rats were fed a LF diet while 22 were fed high fat (HF) diet for 4 weeks. Then four rats were euthanized from each diet group to determine body fat accumulation. The remaining 6 rats in the LF group continued on the same diet. The 18 remaining rats from the HF group were divided into three groups of 6 each.

At the end of the study fermentation variables were determined. Gene copies of total bacteria and M. smithii were determined by qPCR. Results: described are significant at p< 0.05 divided by number of pairwise comparisons. As expected OP rats fed a HF diet significantly accumulated fat and gained weight compared to OR rats. Switching to a LF diet or a LF diet containing RS both significantly reduced emboweled body weight (no gut contents) and fat pad accumulation. Surprisingly OP rats fermented RS more robustly than OR rats as evidenced by increased weight of the empty and full cecum short chain fatty acids and a drop in pH of cecal contents. RS increased gene copies of total bacteria and M. smithii in the cecum only in OP rats. M. smithii gene copy numbers were not significantly different in diets without RS in both OP and OR rats.

Body fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity were not different in OP and OR rats switched to a LF diet or LF with RS.

On the other hand breast cancer is one of popular cancers in female patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity especially in western countries. Then we next examined whether Ex-4 could attenuate breast cancer in the present study. First we observed abundant GLP-1R expression in 3 kinds of human breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 cell MDA-MB-231 cell and KPL-1 cell in both mRNA level and protein level. 0.1~10nM Ex-4 significantly decreased breast cell number of breast cancer cells in dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). Although Ex-4 did not induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells BrdU assay revealed that Ex-4 attenuates cell proliferation of breast cancer cells dosedependently (p<0.01). Further we examined anti-breast cancer effect of Ex-4 in vivo. If we transplanted MCF-7 cells into non-diabetic nude mice subcutaneously and treated them with Ex-4 for 6 weeks we observed decreased tumor size of MCF-7 and serum CA15-3 level a marker of breast cancer in Ex-4-treated mice but not statistical significant.

In this study nondiabetic and diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were treated with DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin for 24 weeks and atherosclerotic lesions in aortic origins were examined. Results showed that diabetes significantly increased atherosclerotic lesions but alogliptin treatment reduced atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic mice. Metabolic studies showed that diabetes increased plasma glucose and that alogliptin treatment reduced glucose. Furthermore immunohistochemistry study showed that diabetes increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta protein expression in atherosclerotic plaques but alogliptin treatment attenuated diabetes-augmented IL-6 and IL-1beta expression. In consistence with the observations from the mouse models our in vitro studies showed that alogliptin-inhibited toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-mediated upregulation of IL-6 IL-1beta and other proinflammatory cytokines by mononuclear cells.

K.","Developments in intestinal cholesterol transport and triglyceride absorption",2017,"Curr Opin Lipidol","Purpose of review To discuss recent advances in research focused on intestinal lipid handling. Recent findings An important strategy in reducing atherosclerosis and risk of cardiovascular events is to increase the rate of reverse cholesterol transport including its final step; cholesterol excretion from the body. The rate of removal is determined by a complex interplay between the factors involved in regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption. One of these factors is a process known as transintestinal cholesterol excretion. This pathway comprises transport of cholesterol directly from the blood through the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen. In humans this pathway accounts for 35% of cholesterol excretion in the feces. Mechanistic studies in mice revealed that activation of the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor increases cholesterol removal via the transintestinal cholesterol excretion pathway as well as decreases plasma cholesterol and triglyceride providing an interesting target for treatment of dyslipidemia in humans. The physical chemical properties of bile acids are under control of farnesoid X receptor and determine intestinal cholesterol and triglyceride solubilization as well as absorption providing a direct link between these two important factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Besides bile acids intestinal phospholipids are important for luminal lipid solubilization. Interestingly phospholipid remodeling through LPCAT3 was shown to be pivotal for uptake of fatty acids by enterocytes which may provide a mechanistic handle for therapeutic intervention.

Approach and Results - Hyperinsulinemia induced by exogenous insulin implantation in high-fat fed (60% fat HFD) apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (ApoE -/-) mice exhibited insulin resistance hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Atherosclerosis was measured by the accumulation of fat macrophage and extracellular matrix in the aorta. After 8 weeks on HFD ApoE -/- mice were subcutaneously implanted with control (sham) or insulin pellet and phlorizin a sodium glucose cotransporters inhibitor (1/2)inhibitor for additional 8 weeks. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test showed that plasma glucose levels were lower and insulin and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) levels were 5.3- and 3.3-fold higher respectively in insulin-implanted compared with sham-treated ApoE -/- mice. Plasma triglyceride cholesterol and lipoprotein levels were decreased in mice with insulin implant in parallel with increased lipoprotein lipase activities. Atherosclerotic plaque by en face and complexity staining showed significant reductions of fat deposits and expressions of vascular adhesion molecule-1 tumor necrosis factor-alpha interleukin 6 and macrophages in arterial wall while exhibiting increased activation of pAKT and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P<0.05) comparing insulin-implanted versus sham HFD ApoE -/- mice. No differences were observed in atherosclerotic plaques between phlorizin-treated and sham HFD ApoE -/- mice except phlorizin significantly lowered plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels while increased glucosuria. Endothelial function was improved only by insulin treatment through endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide activations and reduced proinflammatory (M1) and increased anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages which were inhibited by endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Conclusions - Exogenous insulin decreased atherosclerosis by lowering inflammatory cytokines macrophages and plasma lipids in HFD-induced hyperlipidemia insulin resistant and mildly diabetic ApoE -/- mice.

Approach and Results - Hyperinsulinemia induced by exogenous insulin implantation in high-fat fed (60% fat HFD) apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (ApoE -/-) mice exhibited insulin resistance hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Atherosclerosis was measured by the accumulation of fat macrophage and extracellular matrix in the aorta. After 8 weeks on HFD ApoE -/- mice were subcutaneously implanted with control (sham) or insulin pellet and phlorizin a sodium glucose cotransporters inhibitor (1/2)inhibitor for additional 8 weeks. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test showed that plasma glucose levels were lower and insulin and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) levels were 5.3- and 3.3-fold higher respectively in insulin-implanted compared with sham-treated ApoE -/- mice. Plasma triglyceride cholesterol and lipoprotein levels were decreased in mice with insulin implant in parallel with increased lipoprotein lipase activities. Atherosclerotic plaque by en face and complexity staining showed significant reductions of fat deposits and expressions of vascular adhesion molecule-1 tumor necrosis factor-alpha interleukin 6 and macrophages in arterial wall while exhibiting increased activation of pAKT and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P<0.05) comparing insulin-implanted versus sham HFD ApoE -/- mice. No differences were observed in atherosclerotic plaques between phlorizin-treated and sham HFD ApoE -/- mice except phlorizin significantly lowered plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels while increased glucosuria. Endothelial function was improved only by insulin treatment through endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide activations and reduced proinflammatory (M1) and increased anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages which were inhibited by endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Conclusions - Exogenous insulin decreased atherosclerosis by lowering inflammatory cytokines macrophages and plasma lipids in HFD-induced hyperlipidemia insulin resistant and mildly diabetic ApoE -/- mice.Copyright © 2017 American Heart Association Inc.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.117.310291","1","92-101","38","1079-5642

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been reported to attenuate endothelial dysfunction in the models of atherosclerosis. However whether GLP-1 exerts protective effects on aortic endothelium in diabetic animal model and the underlying mechanisms are still not well defined. Experimental diabetes was induced through administration with combination of high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Rats were randomly divided into four groups including controls diabetes diabetes + sitagliptin (30 mg/kg/day) diabetes + exenatide (3 mug/kg/12 h). Eventually endothelial damage markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were measured. After 12 weeks administration diabetic rats received sitagliptin and exenatide showed significant elevation of serum NO level and reduction of ET-1 as well as inflammatory cytokines levels. Moreover sitagliptin and exenatide significantly inhibited aortic oxidative stress level and improved aortic endothelial function in diabetic rats. Importantly these drugs inhibited the protein expression level in AGE/RAGE-induced RhoA/ROCK/NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha signaling pathways and activated AMPK in diabetic aorta. Finally the target proteins of p-eNOS iNOS and ET-1 which reflect endothelial function were also changed by these drugs. Our present study indicates that sitagliptin and exenatide administrations can improve endothelial function in diabetic aorta. Of note RAGE/RhoA/ROCK and AMPK mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathways may be the intervention targets of these drugs to protect aortic endothelium.",NA,"1","107-16","53","1559-0100",1559,"In_database","duplicate"

We utilized 16S rRNA sequencing metabolomics and regression modeling to examine the impact of PCB 126 on the microbiome and host metabolism and gut health. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that gut microbiota populations shifted at the phylum and genus levels in ways that mimic observations seen in chronic inflammatory diseases. PCB 126 reduced cecum alpha diversity (0.60 fold change; p = 0.001) and significantly increased the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (1.63 fold change; p = 0.044). Toxicant exposed mice exhibited quantifiable concentrations of PCB 126 in the colon upregulation of Cyp1a1 gene expression and increased markers of intestinal inflammation. Also a significant correlation between circulating Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Bifidobacterium was evident and dependent on toxicant exposure. PCB 126 exposure disrupted the gut microbiota and host metabolism and increased intestinal and systemic inflammation. These data imply that the deleterious effects of dioxin-like pollutants may be initiated in the gut and the modulation of gut microbiota may be a sensitive marker of pollutant exposures. Dioxin-like PCB 126 increases gut inflammation disrupts gut microbiota health and modulates microbe/host metabolite and hormone formation in a mouse model of cardiometabolic disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.07.039",NA,"1022-1032","242","0269-7491

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been reported to attenuate endothelial dysfunction in the models of atherosclerosis. However whether GLP-1 exerts protective effects on aortic endothelium in diabetic animal model and the underlying mechanisms are still not well defined. Experimental diabetes was induced through administration with combination of high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Rats were randomly divided into four groups including controls diabetes diabetes + sitagliptin (30 mg/kg/day) diabetes + exenatide (3 mug/kg/12 h). Eventually endothelial damage markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were measured. After 12 weeks administration diabetic rats received sitagliptin and exenatide showed significant elevation of serum NO level and reduction of ET-1 as well as inflammatory cytokines levels. Moreover sitagliptin and exenatide significantly inhibited aortic oxidative stress level and improved aortic endothelial function in diabetic rats. Importantly these drugs inhibited the protein expression level in AGE/RAGE-induced RhoA/ROCK/NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha signaling pathways and activated AMPK in diabetic aorta.

"Prattichizzo F.De Nigris V.Micheloni S.La Sala L.Ceriello A.","Increases in circulating levels of ketone bodies and cardiovascular protection with SGLT2 inhibitors: Is low-grade inflammation the neglected component?",2018,"Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism","Recent clinical trials have demonstrated a strong cardiovascular (CV) protective effect of sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors a recently introduced class of hypoglycaemic agents. The improvement in glycated haemoglobin and other conventional risk factors explains only a portion of the observed reduction in CV risk. A relevant feature of SGLT2-inhibitor-treated diabetic patients is the increase in circulating levels of ketone bodies which has been proposed to mediate part of the beneficial effects of this class of drugs mainly through their bioenergetic properties. However ketone bodies are emerging as potent anti-inflammatory molecules and inflammation is a recognized risk factor for the development of CV events. In this framework we hypothesize that through their unique mechanism of action and by increasing circulating ketone bodies SGLT2 inhibitors indirectly target the IL-1beta pathway and thus produce a consistent amelioration of low-grade inflammation a clinically relevant phenomenon in diabetic patients with high CV risk. This attenuation could slow the progression of CV disease and especially the atherosclerotic process which is sensitive to environmental changes even over a short time period. To test this conceptual structure it would be necessary to measure circulating pro-inflammatory molecules in patients treated with SGLT inhibitors. The addition of inflammatory markers to the list of clinical data measured in FDA-requested large CV outcome trials could provide supplementary information regarding potential secondary effects of new anti-hyperglycaemic drugs considering that the inflammatory process is an often neglected cornerstone of CV diseases.

However their relationship remains largely unknown. Methods: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic apolipoproteinE-null mice (male 20 w) were randomly assigned to six treatment groups: saline (control C) liraglutide at low or high doses (L- and H-Lira at 17 and 107 nmol/kg/d respectively) AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin (AMPKI 25 mg/kg/d) AMPKI+LLira or AMPKI+H-Lira. Results: First we confirmed that AMPKI inhibited H-Lira-induced AMPK phosphorylation in the aorta (1.5-fold). After 4 w biological parameters were similar except for HbA1c levels (C 9.8 L-Lira 8.6 H-Lira 8.4% p<0.05).

In addition we hypothesize that SGLT1 expression is upregulated by increased AMPK activity in ischemia. Methods: Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific RNAi knockdown of SGLT1 (TGSGLT1-KD) were subjected to ex vivo IR (n > 3/group) using a Langendorff hanging heart preparation with 15 min of no-flow ischemia and 20 min of reperfusion while undergoing hemodynamic monitoring. FVB strain wild-type 8-12 week-old male mice (n > 3/group) were administered either the SGLT1 inhibitor phlorizin (400 mg/kg IP) or vehicle and subjected to in vivo ischemia for 30 min by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Hearts were harvested 48 hours later. In vitro studies were conducted in HL-1 cardiomyocytes subjected to 1 h of simulated ischemia with 1 mM NaCN. HL-1 cells were also treated with 1 mM AICAR an AMPK activator for 16 hours and SGLT1 expression was measured. Results: In ex vivo IR studies there was an impairment in the early recovery of double product in the TGSGLT1-KD mice compared to control mice (37% vs 92% at 1 min into reperfusion P< 0.05). In in vivo IR studies phlorizin led to a marked increase in oxidative stress documented by cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA) (control 1.00+/-0.00; IR 1.55+/-0.35; IR + phlorizin 16.15+/-0.40 P<0.001)an increase in apoptosis documented by TUNEL staining and hemodynamic impairment: +dP/dt (mmHg/sec) control 11445+/-504 IR 9811+/-2613 IR + phlorizin 5139+/-481 P<0.05; -dP/dt (mmHg/sec) control -10625+/-589 IR -6770+/-1142 IR + phlorizin -4153+/-474 P<0.05.

PACAP stimulates the sympathetic activity modulates immunological processes and inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PACAP is involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Methods: PACAP-/-/ApoE-/- and PACAP+/+/ ApoE-/- mice were used for the study. 10 weeks-old mice were fed for 20 weeks with a ?normal chow? (NC) or with a cholesterol-enriched ?western diet? (CED). After 30 weeks the mice were weighed and blood samples were taken to determine cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels. Thereafter the animals were sacrificed and the brachiocephalic trunk (TB) was excised and shock-frozen. The lumen stenosis of the TB was assessed on cryo cross-sections (7 mum). Immunohistomorphometrical analyses of the TB was performed with markers for macrophages (CD68) inflammation (IL-1-beta IL-6 COX-2) smooth muscle cells (alpha-actin) prolif- eration (Ki67) autophagy (APG5L/ ATG5) and necroptosis (RIP3). Results: After NC PACAP-/-/ApoE-/- mice were reduced in weight by 14.5 % (p<0.05) whereas total cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels were not different from the PACAP+/+/ApoE-/- control group. PACAP-/-/ApoE-/- mice showed an 11.6-fold (p<0.01) increase in lumen stenosis compared with the control. In atherosclerotic lesions of PACAP-/-/ApoE-/- mice the density of macrophages was decreased by 71.4 % (p<0.01) and that of Ki67 immunoreactive cells by 64.4 % (p<0.05) as compared to control.

We investigated whether GLP-1 protected the heart from dysfunction caused by supply ischemia during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods and Results-Twenty patients with normal left ventricular (LV) function and single-vessel coronary disease within the left anterior descending artery undergoing elective PCI were studied. A conductance catheter was placed into the LV through the femoral artery and pressure-volume loops were recorded at baseline and during a 1-minute low-pressure balloon occlusion at the site of the stenosis. The patients were randomized to receive an infusion of either GLP-1(7-36) amide at 1.2 pmol/kg per minute or saline immediately after the first balloon occlusion. Coronary balloon occlusion caused LV stunning in the control group with cumulative LV dysfunction on subsequent occlusion that was not seen in the GLP-1 group. GLP-1 improved recovery of LV systolic and diastolic function at 30 minutes after balloon occlusion compared with control (delta dP/dt<inf>max</inf> from baseline-1.6% versus-12.2%; P=0.02) and reduced the LV dysfunction after the second balloon occlusion (delta dP/dt <inf>max</inf>-13.1% versus-25.3%; P=0.01).

The patients were randomized to receive an infusion of either GLP-1(7-36) amide at 1.2 pmol/kg per minute or saline immediately after the first balloon occlusion. Coronary balloon occlusion caused LV stunning in the control group with cumulative LV dysfunction on subsequent occlusion that was not seen in the GLP-1 group. GLP-1 improved recovery of LV systolic and diastolic function at 30 minutes after balloon occlusion compared with control (delta dP/dtmax from baseline-1.6% versus-12.2%; P=0.02) and reduced the LV dysfunction after the second balloon occlusion (delta dP/dt max-13.1% versus-25.3%; P=0.01). Conclusions-In this pilot study infusion of GLP-1 has been demonstrated to reduce ischemic LV dysfunction after supply ischemia during coronary balloon occlusion in humans and mitigates stunning. The findings require confirmation in a larger scale clinical trial. Copyright © 2011 American Heart Association.

P.","Cardioprotection against ischaemia induced by dobutamine stress using glucagon-like peptide-1 in patients with coronary artery disease",2010,"Heart","Background: Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) an incretin hormone has been shown to promote myocardial glucose uptake and protect against ischaemia in animal models. Glucose metabolism provides more energy per oxygen molecule than fatty acid oxidation. Therefore changing myocardial metabolism from using free fatty acids (FFA) to glucose could improve myocardial efficiency to maintain normal function despite the constrained oxygen supply that occurs in coronary artery disease. We assessed the hypothesis that GLP-1 infusion would protect the heart from ischaemic dysfunction during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in patients with stable angina and coronary artery disease. Methods: Twelve patients (age 64+/-10 years) with coronary artery disease and good left ventricular (LV) function awaiting elective revascularisation were studied. Two DSE scans were conducted in a randomised order following an overnight fast. GLP-1 (7-36) amide was infused intravenously at 1.2 pmol/kg/min during one of the scans and the other acted as a control. Blood samples were taken for glucose insulin FFA and GLP-1 (7-36). Tissue Doppler imaging was acquired in three apical views at rest peak stress and 30 min into recovery. Regional wall function was assessed by peak systolic velocity (Vs) strain and strain rate averaged from 12 non-apical segments and global LV function was assessed using mitral annular Vs averaged over six sites. Myocardial segments considered to be ischaemic were assigned to the perfusion territories of vessels with >50% stenoses. Results: There was no difference in rate pressure product between the GLP-1 and control scans (21 151+/-4476 vs 21 652+/-3467 mm Hg.bpm; p=0.66). GLP-1 infusion increased plasma GLP-1 (7-36) (186.6+/-67.0 vs 8.0+/-7.6 pg/ml; p<0.0001) and decreased glucose (4.4+/-1.0 vs 5.2+/-1.0 mmol/l; p<0.0001) at peak stress compared to control. GLP-1 infusion did not affect cardiac function at rest but improved both global and regional wall LV function at peak stress and in recovery (Abstract 49 Table 1). There was a reduction in function in recovery compared to baseline in the control scan (stunning) which did not occur with GLP-1 infusion. The improvement in function at peak stress was greater in ischaemic (Vs: 8.92+/-2.42 vs 7.62+/-2.69 cm/s; p<0.0001) than non-ischaemic segments (Vs: 11.26+/-3.52 vs 10.78+/-3.76 cm/s; p=0.28).

Beyond the known defects of insulin resistance and beta-cell insufficiency derangement of incretin hormones normally produced from the gut wall in response to food intake play an important role. In recent years the 'incretin-based' therapies (IBTs) have been developed to address hyperglycemia through either mimicking the action of the endogenous incretin glucagon-like polypeptide (GLP-1) (GLP-1 receptor agonists) or by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme that degrades GLP-1 (the dipeptyl peptidase-4 inhibitors). OBJECTIVE: We reviewed available evidence on the glucose lowering and anti-atherogenic effects of IBT. RESULTS: In addition to their glucose-lowering and weight-neutral or weight-reducing actions IBT decrease systolic blood pressure and improve fasting and postprandial lipid parameters by reducing total-cholesterol low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations and increasing high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol values.

Here we specifically studied the influence of GLP-1(9-36)amide on chronic post-myocardial infarction (MI) remodelling which is a major driver of heart failure progression. METHODS: Adult female C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to permanent coronary artery ligation or sham surgery prior to continuous infusion with GLP-1(9-36)amide or vehicle control for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Infarct size was similar between groups with no effect of GLP-1(9-36)amide on MI-induced cardiac hypertrophy although modest reduction of in vitro phenylephrine-induced H9c2 cardiomyoblast hypertrophy was observed. Whilst echocardiographic systolic dysfunction post-MI remained unchanged diastolic dysfunction (decreased mitral valve E/A ratio increased E wave deceleration rate) was improved by GLP-1(9-36)amide treatment.

This study aimed to explore the potential role of sDPP-4 promoting metabolic-related endothelial dysfunction. The effect of sDPP-4 on vascular reactivity was explored in segments of murine mesenteric microvessels. sDPP-4 (20-500 ng/mL) did not affect the contractility to noradrenaline but did impair the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside. In the presence of the DPP4 enzymatic inhibitor K579 (100 nmol/L) the deleterious effect exerted by sDPP-4 on endothelium-dependent relaxation was completely prevented. On the contrary the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor apocynin (10 mumol/L) did not influence the effects of sDPP4 on endotheliumdependent relaxation. Both the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mumol/L) and the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 mumol/L) abolished the deleterious action of sDPP-4.

To determine whether Glp1r signaling in the PVH mediates the protective effect of neonatal Ex4 we generated mice with conditional loss of Glp1r in the PVH (Sim1Cre; Glp1rloxP/ loxP). Neonatal Ex4 (postnatal days 1-6 1nmol/kg subq) significantly reduced body weight of Glp1rloxP/loxP (control) mice by P33 when compared to Vehicle treated control mice (15.1+/-0.22 vs. 16.3+/-0.44g p<0.05). In contrast neonatal Ex4 did not reduce body weight in Sim1Cre; Glp1rloxP/loxP mice ((15.9+/-0.26 vs. 16.3+/-0.24g Ex4 vs. Vehicle treated Sim1-Cre; Glp1rloxP/loxP p=NS). P33 Ex4 treated control mice displayed a 32% reduction in perigonadal fat pad weight (0.19+/-0.01 vs. 0.28+/-0.02g respectively p<0.05) which was not observed in Sim1Cre; Glp1rloxP/loxP mice (0.26+/-0.03 vs. 0.33+/-0.07g in Ex4 vs. vehicle Sim1Cre; Glp1rloxP/loxP). Ex4 treatment reduced 2hr food intake after a 24hr fast in control mice (0.90+/-0.07 vs. veh control 1.13+/-0.08 p<0.05) which was maintained in Sim1Cre; Glp1rloxP/loxP mice (Ex4 0.86+/-0.07 vs. veh 1.1+/-0.08g p<0.05). Examination of adipose tissue histology and metabolic phenotyping of neonatal Ex4 vs. Vehicle treated Sim1Cre; Glp1rloxP/loxP mice are currently ongoing. Cumulatively these data suggest a specific role for neonatal PVH Glp1r signaling in Ex4 mediated protection against weight gain potentially through diminished fat mass expansion whereas the involvement of other hypothalamic or extra hypothalamic regions are involved in the effect of neonatal Ex4 on the regulation of adult food intake.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db14-1-388","SUPPL. 1","A63","63","0012-1797",1262,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

The DOX clinical use is limited due to the occurrence of accumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity. The objective of study was to investigate the exenatide effects on cardiac rhythm abnormalities and BP changes induced by DOX. Methodology: Male Sprague Dawley rats were used for this study and were distributed into four groups of six animals per group. Groups 1 represented the control while group 2 were the exenatide group. In group 3 DOX was given alone while group 4 received a combination of exenatide and DOX.

It remains to be clarified whether dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition can counteract the impairment of cognitive function and brain atrophy caused by transient cerebral ischemia in type 2 diabetes. The present study was performed to test our hypothesis that linagliptin a DPP-4 inhibitor administration following transient cerebral ischemia can ameliorate cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in diabetic mice. Materials and methods: Eight-week-old male db/db mice a model of obese type 2 diabetes were subjected to transient cerebral ischemia by 17 minutes of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and were administered (1) vehicle or (2) linagliptin (0.083 g/kg in chow) for 8 weeks or 1 week. Results: Linagliptin administration almost completely suppressed the blood DPP-4 activity in db/db mice (P<0.01). However linagliptin did not significantly reduce blood glucose or not improve glucose tolerance in old db/db mice. Linagliptin administration following transient cerebral ischemia significantly counteracted cognitive impairment in diabetic mice subjected to BCCAO as estimated by water maze test (Figure (A)) and passive avoidance test. Linagliptin administration ameliorated the decrease in brain weight (Figure (B)) and also alleviated the decrease in cerebral volume (Figure (C)) and neuron cell number (Figure (D)) in hippocampus and cortex of diabetic mice subjected to BCCAO.

To treat both disorders simultaneously it is highly important to tackle the inflammatory status. Exendin-4 a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist reduces hepatic steatosis and has been suggested to reduce atherosclerosis; however its effects on liver inflammation are underexplored. Here we tested the hypothesis that exendin-4 reduces inflammation in both the liver and vessel wall and investigated the common underlying mechanism. Experimental Approach Female APOE 3-Leiden.CETP mice a model with human-like lipoprotein metabolism were fed a cholesterol-containing Western-type diet for 5 weeks to induce atherosclerosis and subsequently treated for 4 weeks with exendin-4. Key Results Exendin-4 modestly improved dyslipidaemia but markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion severity and area (-33%) accompanied by a reduction in monocyte adhesion to the vessel wall (-42%) and macrophage content in the plaque (-44%). Furthermore exendin-4 reduced hepatic lipid content and inflammation as well as hepatic CD68<sup>+</sup> (-18%) and F4/80<sup>+</sup> (-25%) macrophage content. This was accompanied by less monocyte recruitment from the circulation as the Mac-1<sup>+</sup> macrophage content was decreased (-36%). Finally exendin-4 reduced hepatic chemokine expression in vivo and suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein accumulation in peritoneal macrophages in vitro effects dependent on the GLP-1 receptor. Conclusions and Implications Exendin-4 reduces inflammation in both the liver and vessel wall by reducing macrophage recruitment and activation. These data suggest that exendin-4 could be a valuable strategy to treat NASH and atherosclerosis simultaneously. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bph.12490","3","723-734","171","0007-1188

To treat both disorders simultaneously it is highly important to tackle the inflammatory status. Exendin-4 a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist reduces hepatic steatosis and has been suggested to reduce atherosclerosis; however its effects on liver inflammation are underexplored. Here we tested the hypothesis that exendin-4 reduces inflammation in both the liver and vessel wall and investigated the common underlying mechanism. Experimental Approach Female APOE 3-Leiden.CETP mice a model with human-like lipoprotein metabolism were fed a cholesterol-containing Western-type diet for 5 weeks to induce atherosclerosis and subsequently treated for 4 weeks with exendin-4. Key Results Exendin-4 modestly improved dyslipidaemia but markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion severity and area (-33%) accompanied by a reduction in monocyte adhesion to the vessel wall (-42%) and macrophage content in the plaque (-44%). Furthermore exendin-4 reduced hepatic lipid content and inflammation as well as hepatic CD68+ (-18%) and F4/80+ (-25%) macrophage content. This was accompanied by less monocyte recruitment from the circulation as the Mac-1+ macrophage content was decreased (-36%). Finally exendin-4 reduced hepatic chemokine expression in vivo and suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein accumulation in peritoneal macrophages in vitro effects dependent on the GLP-1 receptor. Conclusions and Implications Exendin-4 reduces inflammation in both the liver and vessel wall by reducing macrophage recruitment and activation.

Here the effect of SEMA and LIRA on the development of atherosclerosis in mouse-models is reported. Study 1: LDLr KO mice (n=23) on Western diet (WD) were treated with vehicle (VEH) or SEMA daily subcutaneously (SC) at three doses (4 12 or 60 mug/kg) for 17 weeks. Study 2: ApoE KO mice (n=15) on WD were treated with LIRA (1.0 mg/kg) or a weight loss comparator (COMP) at two doses (0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg) or VEH SC for 12 weeks. In study 1 inflammatory markers on aortic tissue were assessed by NanoString analyses. In both studies plasma cholesterol (CHL) and triglycerides (TG) were determined by HPLC and aortic plaques by En Face. Study 1: SEMA attenuated aortic plaque development to a similar degree at all doses (4 mug/kg: 4.5+/-0.8% 12 mug/kg: 4.0+/-0.8% and 60 mug/kg: 4.6+/-1.1% vs. VEH 13.1+/-1.3%; p<0.0001). All doses of SEMA were associated with reduced inflammation in the plaques where 87 genes related to inflammation were significantly regulated compared to VEH. Specifically leukocyte recruitment adhesion and migration were beneficially regulated. This was independent of BW as only SEMA at 60 mug/kg significantly reduced BW (VEH: 35.9+/-1.1 vs. 60mug/kg: 30.5+/-0.7g; p<0.0001). Study 2: Compared to VEH the COMP at 0.8 mg/kg had a 27% (p<0.0001) and LIRA a 19% (p<0.0001) lower BW. However only LIRA prevented plaque development (VEH: 17.1+/-1.9% vs. LIRA: 11.1+/-1.9%; p<0.05) and neither COMP group had effect on plaques (0.2 mg/kg: 17.2+/-1.6%; 0.8 mg/kg: 19.6+/-1.5%). Plasma CHL was not affected and only SEMA at 60 mug/kg reduced plasma TG (VEH: 6.8+/-0.8mM vs. 60mug/ kg: 4.4+/-0.4mM; p<0.05).

Here the effect of SEMA and LIRA on the development of atherosclerosis in mouse-models is reported. Study 1: LDLr KO mice (n=23) on Western diet (WD) were treated with vehicle (VEH) or SEMA daily subcutaneously (SC) at three doses (4 12 or 60 mug/kg) for 17 weeks. Study 2: ApoE KO mice (n=15) on WD were treated with LIRA (1.0 mg/kg) or a weight loss comparator (COMP) at two doses (0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg) or VEH SC for 12 weeks. In study 1 inflammatory markers on aortic tissue were assessed by NanoString analyses. In both studies plasma cholesterol (CHL) and triglycerides (TG) were determined by HPLC and aortic plaques by En Face. Study 1: SEMA attenuated aortic plaque development to a similar degree at all doses (4 mug/kg: 4.5+/-0.8% 12 mug/kg: 4.0+/-0.8% and 60 mug/kg: 4.6+/-1.1% vs. VEH 13.1+/-1.3%; p<0.0001). All doses of SEMA were associated with reduced inflammation in the plaques where 87 genes related to inflammation were significantly regulated compared to VEH. Specifically leukocyte recruitment adhesion and migration were beneficially regulated. This was independent of BW as only SEMA at 60 mug/kg significantly reduced BW (VEH: 35.9+/-1.1 vs. 60mug/kg: 30.5+/-0.7g; p<0.0001). Study 2: Compared to VEH the COMP at 0.8 mg/kg had a 27% (p<0.0001) and LIRA a 19% (p<0.0001) lower BW. However only LIRA prevented plaque development (VEH: 17.1+/-1.9% vs. LIRA: 11.1+/-1.9%; p<0.05) and neither COMP group had effect on plaques (0.2 mg/kg: 17.2+/-1.6%; 0.8 mg/kg: 19.6+/-1.5%). Plasma CHL was not affected and only SEMA at 60 mug/kg reduced plasma TG (VEH: 6.8+/-0.8mM vs. 60mug/ kg: 4.4+/-0.4mM; p<0.05). In mouse models of atherosclerosis long acting GLP-1 RAs SEMA or LIRA protect against atherosclerosis independent of BW.

Here we examined the effects of sitagliptin and vildagliptin DPP-4 inhibitors on systemic inflammation pro-inflammatory (M1) / anti-inflammatory (M2)-like phenotypes of peripheral blood monocytes and arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: Twenty-six type 2 diabetic patients treated with sitagliptin (50 mg daily) 6 diabetic patients treated with vildagliptin (100 mg daily) and 24 untreated control were studied for 3 months. Measurements were undertaken to assess changes in glucose-lipid metabolism serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as serum amyloid A-LDL (SAA-LDL) C-reactive protein (hsCRP) interleukin-6 (IL-6) IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Furthermore the effects of each treatment on M1/M2-like phenotypes in peripheral blood monocytes and Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) an index of arterial stiffness were examined. Results: Treatment with sitagliptin and vildagliptin significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose HbA1c. In addition sitagliptin significantly decreased serum levels of inflammatory markers such as SAA-LDL CRP and TNF-alpha and increased serum IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine as well as plasma GLP-1. Furthermore sitagliptin increased monocyte IL-10 expression and both sitagliptin and vildagliptin decreased monocyte TNF-alpha expression. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the sitagliptin treatment was the only factor independently associated with an increase in monocyte IL-10 (beta = 0.499; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.293 P < 0.05). However other factors including the improvement of glucose metabolism were not associated with the increase. Vildagliptin treatment significantly reduced CAVI although sitagliptin did not significantly reduce it for 3 months.

We report that rats receiving liraglutide show markedly attenuated infarct volumes and neurological deficit following ischemic insult. We have also investigated the effect of liraglutide on apoptosis and oxidative stress pathways after ischemic injury in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350g were used. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Rats were pretreated with either vehicle or liraglutide (50mug/kg s.c.) for 14days and thereafter subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Twenty-four hours after occlusion rats were assessed for neurological deficit motor function and subsequently sacrificed for estimation of infarct volume oxidative stress and apoptotic markers. Vehicle-treated non-diabetic and diabetic rats showed significant (p<0.001) neurological deficit following cerebral ischemia. Liraglutide pretreatment resulted in significantly (p<0.001) less neurological deficit compared to vehicle-treated MCAO rats. Cerebral ischemia produced significant (p<0.0001) infarction in vehicle-treated rats; however the infarct volume was significantly (p<0.001) less in liraglutide-pretreated rats. Oxidative stress markers were increased following ischemia but were attenuated in liraglutide-treated rats. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased and pro-apoptotic protein Bax expression was increased in vehicle-treated MCAO rats compared to sham (p<0.0001). On the other hand liraglutide pretreatment showed significantly (p<0.01) increased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased expression of Bax in MCAO rats.

We report that rats receiving liraglutide show markedly attenuated infarct volumes and neurological deficit following ischemic insult. We have also investigated the effect of liraglutide on apoptosis and oxidative stress pathways after ischemic injury in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350g were used. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Rats were pretreated with either vehicle or liraglutide (50mug/kg s.c.) for 14days and thereafter subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Twenty-four hours after occlusion rats were assessed for neurological deficit motor function and subsequently sacrificed for estimation of infarct volume oxidative stress and apoptotic markers. Vehicle-treated non-diabetic and diabetic rats showed significant (p<0.001) neurological deficit following cerebral ischemia. Liraglutide pretreatment resulted in significantly (p<0.001) less neurological deficit compared to vehicle-treated MCAO rats. Cerebral ischemia produced significant (p<0.0001) infarction in vehicle-treated rats; however the infarct volume was significantly (p<0.001) less in liraglutide-pretreated rats. Oxidative stress markers were increased following ischemia but were attenuated in liraglutide-treated rats. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased and pro-apoptotic protein Bax expression was increased in vehicle-treated MCAO rats compared to sham (p<0.0001). On the other hand liraglutide pretreatment showed significantly (p<0.01) increased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased expression of Bax in MCAO rats. In vehicle-treated group the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells significantly (p<0.0001) increased in the ischemic hemisphere compared to sham-operated group. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in vehicle group was 73.5+/-3.3 and 85.5+/-5.2/750mum2 in non-diabetic and diabetic vehicle-treated MCAO rats respectively.

METHODS: Mouse macrophages Raw264.7 cells were exposed to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to induce the formation of foam cells. The cells were incubated with oxLDL (50 microg/mL) liraglutide (0.1 0.5 1 and 2 nmol/L) or exendin-3 (9-39) (1 10 and 100 nmol/L) alone or in combination. Oil Red O staining was used to detect intracellular lipid droplets. The levels of TG and cholesterol were measured using the commercial kits. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD). Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of AMPKalpha1 SREBP1 phosphorylated AMPKalpha1 phosphorylated SREBP1 glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R).

"Watanabe T.Sato K.Itoh F.Noguchi Y.Fujimoto K.Koyama T.Shichiri M.","Emerging roles for vasoactive peptides in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases",2013,"Curr Protein Pept Sci","Coronary artery disease (CAD) arising from atherosclerosis remains the most common cause of death and morbidity worldwide although its risk factors such as hypertension dyslipidemia and diabetes have been individually treated with increasingly improved outcomes. Therefore it is important to develop diagnostic and therapeutic windows for CAD. Many classical vasoactive hormones inflammatory cytokines and oxidative products have been implicated as potential biomarkers. Our recent studies have shown that high levels of the pro-atherogenic vasoactive agents serotonin and urotensin II which are potent vasoconstrictors can be used as biomarkers for CAD. In subsequent trials we unraveled anti- and pro-atherogenic roles for more recently identified peptides. Anti-atherogenic peptides include the adipocytokine adiponectin the neuronal growth factor heregulin-beta(1) (neuregulin-1 type I) the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and a peptide recently identified by an in silico approach salusin-alpha. Atherogenic roles have been demonstrated by cellular animal and clinical experiments which indicate that human adiponectin heregulin-beta(1) GLP-1 and salusin-alpha attenuate the development of atherosclerotic lesions by suppressing macrophage foam cell formation via down-regulation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1. Circulating levels of these peptides in the blood are markedly decreased in CAD patients compared with those in non-CAD patients.

"Watanabe T.Sato K.Itoh F.Noguchi Y.Fujimoto K.Koyama T.Shichiri M.","Emerging roles for vasoactive peptides in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases",2013,"Current Protein and Peptide Science","Coronary artery disease (CAD) arising from atherosclerosis remains the most common cause of death and morbidity worldwide although its risk factors such as hypertension dyslipidemia and diabetes have been individually treated with increasingly improved outcomes. Therefore it is important to develop diagnostic and therapeutic windows for CAD. Many classical vasoactive hormones inflammatory cytokines and oxidative products have been implicated as potential biomarkers. Our recent studies have shown that high levels of the pro-atherogenic vasoactive agents serotonin and urotensin II which are potent vasoconstrictors can be used as biomarkers for CAD. In subsequent trials we unraveled anti- and pro-atherogenic roles for more recently identified peptides. Anti-atherogenic peptides include the adipocytokine adiponectin the neuronal growth factor heregulin-beta<inf>1</inf> (neuregulin-1 type I) the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and a peptide recently identified by an in silico approach salusin-alpha. Atherogenic roles have been demonstrated by cellular animal and clinical experiments which indicate that human adiponectin heregulin-beta<inf>1</inf> GLP-1 and salusin-alpha attenuate the development of atherosclerotic lesions by suppressing macrophage foam cell formation via down-regulation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1. Circulating levels of these peptides in the blood are markedly decreased in CAD patients compared with those in non-CAD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses have shown that salusin-alpha is the most useful biomarker for detecting CAD among the four peptides examined. Therefore salusin-alpha alone or in various combinations with heregulin-beta<inf>1</inf> adiponectin and/or GLP-1 is a candidate biomarker for predicting CAD. Further anti-atherogenic peptides could potentially serve as useful therapeutic targets for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/13892037113149990064","6","472-480","14","1389-2037

"Sekar R.Chow B. K. C.","Secretin receptor knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and exhibit impaired intestinal lipid absorption",2013,"Endocrine Reviews. Conference: 95th Annual Meeting and Expo of the Endocrine Society ENDO","Secretin (Sct) a gastrointestinal hormone functions primarily to stimulate exocrine secretion from the pancreas and has recently been shown also to regulate water homeostasis. Sct is released from the gut in response to lipid intake and this has been recently shown to be mediated by Cluster of Differentiation 36 (CD36) dependant signaling pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Sct in metabolic control and lipid homeostasis in wildtype (Wt) and secretin receptor knockout (SctR-KO) mice under chronic high fat diet (HFD). Body composition of the animals was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and plasma metabolic parameters and food intake were also analyzed. After a HFD treatment for 12 weeks despite similar levels of food intake as Wt mice SctR-KO had decreased body weight (Wt 49.6A+/-0.9g; SctR-KO 44.7A+/-1.4g; P<0.05) and body fat percentage (12.7A+/-0.8% reduced; P<0.005). In addition reduced plasma glucose levels and improved glucose and insulin tolerance were also observed in SctR-KO mice. Hyperleptinaemia that is induced by HFD was reduced in SctR-KO (Wt 28.6A+/-0.2ng/ml; SctR-KO 25.5A+/-0.6ng/ml; P<0.0005) while levels of GLP-1 were similar. Interestingly SctR-KO mice had impaired intestinal lipid absorption. Triglyceride (TG) release after oral administration of olive oil was significantly reduced in SctR-KO. Furthermore at the molecular level the gene expression level of CD36 (-49A+/-7%; P<0.01) Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (-42A+/-7%; P<0.05) and mitochondrial transfer protein (MTTP) (-29A+/-11%; P<0.05) were reduced in the intestine of SctR-KO mice. Additionally to assess the direct effect of Sct on intestinal lipid absorption jejunal cells of the Wt and SctR-KO mice were isolated and stimulated with Sct which resulted in up-regulation of CD36 (+42A+/-14%; P<0.05) transcript. Thus we provide evidence here that the resistance to diet-induced obesity exhibited by SctR-KO mice is due to impaired intestinal lipid absorption. From the above findings we propose a novel short positive feedback regulation pathway involving Sct and CD36 that is triggered upon lipid intake and functions to maximize intestinal lipid absorption. This study paves way for improving our understanding of mechanisms involved in nutrient absorption and thus could help in developing novel therapeutic strategies for lipid associated metabolic disorders such as hyper-and dys-lipoproteinemia atherosclerosis obesity and associated metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes.",NA,"3 SUPPL. 1",NA,"34","0163-769X",545,"In_database","unique"

Liraglutide improves glycaemic control lowers body weight and is the subject of clinical trials to evaluate effects on cardiovascular disease. We have previously demonstrated liraglutide-mediated attenuation of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) induced plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells in vitro and significant improvement in endothelial function and attenuation of adhesion molecule expression in vivo in the ApoE-/- mouse model. The current study aimed to determine the in vivo effect of liraglutide on atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability in the ApoE-/- mouse model. Materials and methods: In vivo experiments utilized early onset disease (1) or established disease (2) protocols-:(1) 17 week old ApoE-/- mice maintained on a normal chow diet were simultaneously commenced on a high fat diet and either saline (vehicle) liraglutide (300mug/kg twice daily s.c) or liraglutide + exendin-9 (150pmol/kg/min s.c. osmotic mini-pump) for 4 weeks or (2) 18 week old ApoE-/- mice maintained on a high fat diet for 12 weeks were treated with a regime identical to protocol 1 for 4 weeks. Results: Oil red O staining and intima to media ratio (IMR) analysis of atherosclerotic plaques from the aorta and brachiocephalic artery (BCA) identified a significant reduction in lipid deposition and IMR in liraglutide treated mice from protocol 1. A statistically significant increase in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) content as assessed by alpha-smooth muscle actin staining of BCA atherosclerotic lesions in liraglutide-treated mice from protocol 1 was identified.

In addition postprandial hyperlipidemia and elevated plasma concentrations of intestinal apoB48-containing chylomicron and chylomicron remnant particles have been demonstrated in insulin resistant states. Intestinal lipoprotein production is primarily determined by the amount of fat ingested and absorbed. Until approximately 10 years ago however relatively little attention was paid to the role of the intestine itself in regulating the production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and its dysregulation in pathological states such as insulin resistance. We and others have shown that insulin resistant animal models and humans are characterized by overproduction of intestinal apoB48-containing lipoproteins. Whereas various factors are known to regulate hepatic lipoprotein particle production less is known about factors that regulate the production of intestinal lipoprotein particles. Monosacharides plasma free fatty acids (FFA) resveratrol intestinal peptides (e.g. GLP-1 and GLP-2) and pancreatic hormones (e.g. insulin) have recently been shown to be important regulators of intestinal lipoprotein secretion. Available evidence in humans and animal models strongly supports the concept that the small intestine is not merely an absorptive organ but rather plays an active role in regulating the rate of production of chylomicrons in fed and fasting states. Metabolic signals in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and in some cases an aberrant intestinal response to these factors contribute to the enhanced formation and secretion of TRL. Understanding the regulation of intestinal lipoprotein production is imperative for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia. Here we review recent developments in this field and present evidence that intestinal lipoprotein production is a process with metabolic plasticity and that modulation of intestinal lipoprotein secretion may be a feasible therapeutic strategy in the treatment of dyslipidemia and possibly prevention of atherosclerosis.","10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.12.047","2","608-15","233","0021-9150",202,"In_database","unique"

Available evidence in humans and animal models strongly supports the concept that the small intestine is not merely an absorptive organ but rather plays an active role in regulating the rate of production of chylomicrons in fed and fasting states. Metabolic signals in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and in some cases an aberrant intestinal response to these factors contribute to the enhanced formation and secretion of TRL. Understanding the regulation of intestinal lipoprotein production is imperative for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia. Here we review recent developments in this field and present evidence that intestinal lipoprotein production is a process with metabolic plasticity and that modulation of intestinal lipoprotein secretion may be a feasible therapeutic strategy in the treatment of dyslipidemia and possibly prevention of atherosclerosis. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.12.047","2","608-615","233","0021-9150

Liraglutide improves glycaemic control lowers body weight and is the subject of clinical trials to evaluate effects on cardiovascular disease. We have previously demonstrated liraglutide-mediated attenuation of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) induced plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells in vitro and significant improvement in endothelial function and attenuation of adhesion molecule expression in vivo in the ApoE-/- mouse model. The current study aimed to determine the in vivo effect of liraglutide on atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability in the ApoE-/- mouse model. Materials and methods: In vivo experiments utilized early onset disease (1) or established disease (2) protocols-:(1) 17 week old ApoE-/- mice maintained on a normal chow diet were simultaneously commenced on a high fat diet and either saline (vehicle) liraglutide (300mug/kg twice daily s.c) or liraglutide + exendin-9 (150pmol/kg/min s.c. osmotic mini-pump) for 4 weeks or (2) 18 week old ApoE-/- mice maintained on a high fat diet for 12 weeks were treated with a regime identical to protocol 1 for 4 weeks. Results: Oil red O staining and intima to media ratio (IMR) analysis of atherosclerotic plaques from the aorta and brachiocephalic artery (BCA) identified a significant reduction in lipid deposition and IMR in liraglutide treated mice from protocol 1. A statistically significant increase in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) content as assessed by alpha-smooth muscle actin staining of BCA atherosclerotic lesions in liraglutide-treated mice from protocol 1 was identified. The increase in SMC composition and decrease in lipid deposition in plaques from the BCA of protocol 1 mice are suggestive of a plaque stabilising effect associated with liraglutide treatment. Attenuation of the liraglutide-mediated plaque stabilising effect by concurrent administration of the GLP-1R antagonist exendin-9 confirmed the GLP-1R-dependence of this effect. Vascular reactivity studies identified no apparent endothelial dysfunction in the aorta of mice from protocol 1 however liraglutide treatment significantly attenuated the endothelial dysfunction in mice from protocol 2.

However mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of CVD in T2D are poorly understood. Pre-clinical studies in animals and recent human clinical trials have demonstrated robust cardioprotective actions of incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) related peptides and drugs. How GLP-1 prevents acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) as well as chronic myocardial ischemic injury has not been established. We previously described that GLP-1(28-36) a small metabolite of GLP-1 is as protective as the parent peptide in ex vivo isolated heart IRI and in vivo experimental myocardial infarction (MI) models in mice and that these effects require soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) but not the known GLP- 1 receptor. Here we define the molecular mechanisms and cell types in which GLP-1(28-36) activates sAC. Methods and results: Immunoblots reveal that mouse and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (caSMC) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (caEC) express sAC while mouse neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (CM) a mouse atrial CM cell line (HL-1) and human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived CM do not. Using pharmacological inhibitors of sAC sAC-null mice and siRNA against sAC we demonstrate that GLP-1(28-36) causes sAC-dependent increases in cAMP activation of PKA and cytoprotection from oxidative stress injury in both mouse and human caSMC. Moreover GLP-1(28-36) increases cAMP responses in human caEC and probenecid which blocks the anion (HCO3) entry required for sAC activity abrogates these effects. By contrast human ESCderived CM shows no cAMP or cytoprotection responses to GLP-1(28-36).

Affinity pull-down experiments using biotinylated-GLP-1(28-36) proteomic analysis with mass spectrometry and confirmatory immunoblots suggest that GLP-1(28-36) interacts with mitochondrial trifunctional protein alpha (MTPalpha) an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism and does not directly interact with sAC. Using extracellular flux analysis of caSMC and caEC and siRNA against MTPalpha we demonstrate that the ability of GLP-1(28-36) to shift substrate utilization towards the energy efficient glucose utilization and away from the high energy consuming fatty acid oxidation is dependent on MTPalpha.

Therapies activating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signalling are increasingly used in the treatment of diabetes. These therapies have influence on cardiovascular function but the expression of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in the atherosclerotic arteries is unclear. We evaluated the level of GLP-1R expression in the aorta of atherosclerotic and diabetic mice by immunohistochemistry and a novel GLP-1R targeting PET tracer 68Ga-NODAGA-Exendin-4. Methods: Eight atherosclerotic low density lipoprotein receptor deficientmice expressing only apolipoprotein B100 (LDLR-/-ApoB100/100) seven atherosclerotic and diabetic mice overexpressing insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB100/100) and six healthy C57BL/6N mice were studied. Mice were fasted for 4 hours and glucose tolerance test was performed. The 68Ga-NODAGA-Exendin-4 (20 +/- 2 MBq) was intravenously injected and at 60 minutes post-injection aorta and other tissues were excised and measured for total radioactivity by using a gamma counter. The aorta was then cut into serial longitudinal cryosections for autoradiography histology and immunohistochemistry of GLP-1R. Results: Aortas of LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 and IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 mice contained advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Diabetic mice demonstrated hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Immunohistochemistry showed GLP-1R expressing cells in atherosclerotic plaques. Compared with healthy mice ex vivo gammacounting revealed increased (p < 0.01) uptake of 68Ga-NODAGA-Exendin-4 in aortas of both LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 and diabetic IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 mice (0.38 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.32 and 0.73 +/- 0.16% IA/g respectively). Autoradiography showed focally increased (p < 0.001) tracer uptake in atherosclerotic plaques compared with healthy vessel wall of the same mice (plaque-to-vessel wall ratio 1.6 +/- 0.1). 68Ga-NODAGA-Exendin-4 uptake was comparable in diabetic and non-diabetic mice but the uptake in atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice correlated with the blood glucose levels (r = 0.89 p = 0.008).

In addition postprandial hyperlipidemia and elevated plasma concentrations of intestinal apoB48-containing chylomicron and chylomicron remnant particles have been demonstrated in insulin resistant states. Intestinal lipoprotein production is primarily determined by the amount of fat ingested and absorbed. Until approximately 10 years ago however relatively little attention was paid to the role of the intestine itself in regulating the production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and its dysregulation in pathological states such as insulin resistance. We and others have shown that insulin resistant animal models and humans are characterized by overproduction of intestinal apoB48-containing lipoproteins. Whereas various factors are known to regulate hepatic lipoprotein particle production less is known about factors that regulate the production of intestinal lipoprotein particles. Monosacharides plasma free fatty acids (FFA) resveratrol intestinal peptides (e.g. GLP-1 and GLP-2) and pancreatic hormones (e.g. insulin) have recently been shown to be important regulators of intestinal lipoprotein secretion. Available evidence in humans and animal models strongly supports the concept that the small intestine is not merely an absorptive organ but rather plays an active role in regulating the rate of production of chylomicrons in fed and fasting states. Metabolic signals in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and in some cases an aberrant intestinal response to these factors contribute to the enhanced formation and secretion of TRL. Understanding the regulation of intestinal lipoprotein production is imperative for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia.

We investigated the role of gustducin in the effect of long-term intragastric administration of sucralose or FOS on (i) ghrelin release (ii) body weight gain and (iii) gut permeability. Methods: In vitro ghrelinoma cells were stimulated with FOS or sucralose at different time points and the effect on ghrelin release was measured by radioimmunoassay. In vivo wildtype (WT) and a-gustducin knockout (a-gust-/-) mice were put on a high-fat diet at 6 weeks of age while being gavaged once daily with equisweet solutions of FOS (300 mg) sucralose (4 mM) or water for 8 weeks. Food intake and body weight were monitored an OGTT was performed after 6 weeks and changes in colon permeability (transepithelial resistance [TEER]) were measured in Ussing chambers. Results: In ghrelinoma cells sucralose and FOS induced a time-dependent decrease in ghrelin release (93 +/- 0.8 and 63.8 +/- 4.2% after 24 h respectively p < 0.005).

Methods and materials: Animal model of type 2 diabetes rich-fat/STZ rats was used. Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups: dapagliflozin-treated with glucose excursions placebo-treated with glucose excursions and placebo-treated with stable diabetes. Dapagliflozin was administered once a day 1 mg/kg for 8 consecutive weeks. Glucose levels were measured twice a week at fasting and postprandially. The samples of aortas were taken for histopathological and immunochemistry examinations at the end of the experiment. The derangement in the aortic wall and the distribution of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the aorta were considered early signs of atherosclerosis. Results: Dapagliflozin reduced glucose excursion to the level characteristic for stable well-controlled diabetes. It was related to a significant decrease in histopathological changes which were observed in the placebo-treated rats with glucose variability. Dapagliflozin significantly reduced also the accumulation of CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the aortic adventitia.

Optimal management of diabetes involves a multidisciplinary approach focused in particular on decreasing the risk of atherosclerosis.

Methods and materials: Animal model of type 2 diabetes rich-fat/STZ rats was used. Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups: dapagliflozin-treated with glucose excursions placebo-treated with glucose excursions and placebo-treated with stable diabetes. Dapagliflozin was administered once a day 1 mg/kg for 8 consecutive weeks. Glucose levels were measured twice a week at fasting and postprandially. The samples of aortas were taken for histopathological and immunochemistry examinations at the end of the experiment. The derangement in the aortic wall and the distribution of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the aorta were considered early signs of atherosclerosis. Results: Dapagliflozin reduced glucose excursion to the level characteristic for stable well-controlled diabetes.

Conference: 18th Scientific Symposium of the Austrian Pharmacological Society APHAR","Background: TGR5 (M-BAR GPBAR or GPR131) is a plasma membranebound G protein-coupled receptor for bile acids expressed in many human cells. The aim of this study was to describe that targeting TGR5 could provide an exciting new pharmacological approach to improve different aspects of the metabolic syndrome in humans. Methods: The data on pharmacological targeting of TGR5 have been provided from more than eighty review and original scientific articles published from 2007 to 2012. The research was performed using the following key words: bile acids TGR5 metabolism diabetes obesity. Results: A dietary supplementation of bile acids (BAs) significantly reduced body weight in mice fed with a fat-rich diet. It was the consequence of the induction of deiodinase 2 (D2) through a TGR5/cAMP-mediated pathway. D2 is able to induce the conversion of inactive thyroxine (T4) into the active 353'-tri-iodothyronine (T3) which enhances the energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and skeletal muscle myoblasts. TGR5 induces glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in cultured mouse enteroendocrine STC-1 cells. This property contributes to beneficial effects of TGR5 on glucose metabolism and improves insulin sensitivity. TGR5 activation in mice decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels. The antiinflammatory action of TGR5 in mouse macrophages attenuated the development of atherosclerotic lesions and could contribute to protective effects of TGR5 on liver steatosis. Conclusions: TGR5 may be targeted by natural compounds as well as by synthetic agonists.

Cardiol. 2013). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4-inhibitors (DPP4i) are a new class of drugs which improve glycemic control. More recently potent anti-inflammatory properties for these drugs were reported in the setting of experimental atherosclerosis and sepsis (Shah Circulation 2011 Kroller-Schon Cardiovasc. Res. 2012). With the present study we aimed to test the hypothesis whether DPP4i therapy may improve endothelial dysfunction via a reduction of oxidative stress in the animal model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Methods: MonoMac-6 cells and human polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) were used for in-vitro studies (incubation with ATII (1mug/ml) and different doses of linagliptin. As an animal model DPP4i (linagliptin) was applied s.c. in WT mice. Arterial hypertension was induced by s.c. AT-II administration (1mg/kg/d). Aortic vascular function was tested by isometric tension recording. Aortic and cardiac tissue was used for Western blotting and RT-PCR. Results: In cultured monocytes DPP4 surface expression increased significantly after 24h of ATII incubation. In addition aortic tissue of ATII treated mice show increased DPP4 mRNA expression levels. Inhibition of DPP4 by linagliptin reduced oxidative burst dose-dependently in MonoMac-6 cells and human PMN. Furthermore linagliptin decreased mRNA levels of Nox2 and VCAM-1 in cultured cells. In mice linagliptin improved endothelial dysfunction in ATII-induced hypertension. Aortic mRNA level of iNOS was increased by ATII treatment all of which was normalized by treatment with linagliptin. Furthermore ATII-induced increase in cardiac NADPH oxidase (Nox2) activity and mRNA expression levels were markedly suppressed by DPP4i. Conclusion: Leukocyte-derived oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development of endothelial dysfunction in ATII-induced hypertension. The results of the present study reveal a participation of DPP4 in ATII-induced hypertension as DPP4 expression increases in-vitro and in-vivo due to ATII treatment. Furthermore DPP4 activity is linked to leukocyte activation and can be blocked by linagliptin treatment.

After confirmation of atherosclerotic plaques in brachiocephalic arteries by iMap intravascular ultrasound (iMAP-IVUS) GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide was administered to WHHL rabbits at 30 nmoL/kg/day for 12 weeks by osmotic pump. An equal volume of normal saline was administered in a control group. After evaluation by iMAP-IVUS at 12 weeks brachiocephalic arteries were harvested for pathological histological analysis. Results iMAP-IVUS analysis revealed larger fibrotic plaque components and smaller necrotic and calcified plaque components in the GLP-1 group than in the control group; %fibrotic area: 66.30 +/- 2.06% vs. 75.14 +/- 2.62% p < 0.01 %necrotic area: 23.25 +/- 1.87% vs. 16.17 +/- 2.27% p = 0.02 %calcified area: 2.15 +/- 0.24% vs. 1.00 +/- 0.18% p < 0.01) indicating that GLP-1 receptor agonist might modify plaque composition and increase plaque stability. Histological analysis confirmed that GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment improved smooth muscle cell (SMC)-rich plaque with increased fibrotic content. Furthermore plaque macrophage infiltration and calcification were significantly reduced by GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment; %SMC area: 6.93 +/- 0.31% vs. 8.14 +/- 0.48% p = 0.02; %macrophage area: 9.11 +/- 0.80% vs. 6.19 +/- 0.85% p < 0.01; %fibrotic area: 54.75 +/- 1.63% vs. 69.60 +/- 2.12% p = 0.02; %calcified area: 3.25 +/- 0.67% vs. 0.75 +/- 0.15% p = 0.02).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) belongs to the incretin hormone family. L cells in the small intestine secrete GLP-1 in response to food intake. GLP-1 not only enhances glucose-evoked insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells but also suppresses glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells. In addition GLP-1 slows gastric emptying. Therefore enhancement of GLP-1 secretion is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a responsible enzyme that mainly degrades GLP-1 and the half-life of circulating GLP-1 is very short. Recently DPP-4 inhibitors and DPP-4-resistant GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been developed and clinically used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as a GLP-1-based medicine. GLP-1R is shown to exist in extra-pancreatic tissues such as vessels kidney and heart and could mediate the diverse biological actions of GLP-1 in a variety of tissues. So in this paper we review the pleiotropic effects of GLP-1-based therapies and its clinical utility in vascular complications in diabetes.",NA,"38","4379-85","17","1381-6128",945,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

It has been reported that stimulating the GLP-1 receptor can protect neurons against metabolic and oxidative insults and therefore can be used in the treatment of stroke and Parkinsons disease. The present study aimed to examine the neuroprotective effects of rhGLP-1 (7-36) and its possible mechanisms against acute ischemia/reperfusion injuries induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in diabetic rats. The type 2 diabetic rat model was established by a combination of a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). RhGLP-1 (7-36) (20 40 80mug/kg) was given intraperitoneally before reperfusion. The neuroprotective effects of rhGLP-1 (7-36) were evaluated by changes in neurological deficit scores and 235-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Changes in blood glucose were used to assess hypoglycemic effects. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) inducible nitric oxide syntheses (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide syntheses (eNOS) after MCAO/R administration (2h and 46h) were examined to investigate the possible mechanisms of RhGLP-1 (7-36). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used for histopathological observation. Compared with the control group rhGLP-1 (7-36)-treated groups decreased nerve function deficiency scores; significantly reduced infarction volume percentage MDA iNOS and blood glucose; and significantly increased SOD GSH-PX and eNOS. In addition rhGLP-1 (7-36) groups enhanced the density of surviving neurons and increased vascular proliferation. The current study suggests a neuroprotective effect of rhGLP-1 (7-36) in diabetic MCAO/R rats since anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative stress effects can contribute to beneficial effects against ischemia/reperfusion injury.","10.1016/j.brainres.2015.01.014",NA,"153-9","1602","0006-8993",217,"In_database","unique"

Recently central glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP2R) signaling has been implicated in regulating hepatic insulin sensitivity; however its role in hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism is unknown. We investigated the role of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) in regulating hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in Syrian golden hamsters C57BL/6J mice and Glp2r-/- mice consuming either a normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD). In the chow-fed hamsters IP GLP-2 administration significantly increased fasting dyslipidemia hepatic VLDL production and the expression of key genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In HFD-fed hamsters and chow-fed mice GLP-2 administration exacerbated or induced hepatic lipid accumulation. HFD-fed Glp2r-/- mice displayed reduced glucose tolerance VLDL secretion and microsomal transfer protein lipid transfer activity as well as exacerbated fatty liver. Thus we conclude that GLP-2 plays a lipogenic role in the liver by increasing lipogenic gene expression and inducing hepatic steatosis fasting dyslipidemia and VLDL overproduction.

Teneligliptin also attenuated the elastin degradation grade (2.33+/-0.22 versus 3.27+/-0.23 in the control group P=0.0045). The number of macrophages which migrated to abdominal aorta was decreased in Teneligliptin group whereas Teneligliptin did not change the glucose level blood pressure and body weight between 2 groups. In vitro Teneligliptin attenuated LPS-induced MMP9 secretion from the peritoneal macrophages of ApoEKO mice. Conclusion: Teneligliptin suppressed AAA formation in the model of ApoEKO mice with HFD and AII. The beneficial effect of Teneligliptin did not depend on glucose improvement.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db15386741","SUPPL. 1","A113","64","0012-1797",1199,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Conference: American Heart Association","Background- Emerging animal studies have reported the beneficial effect of interrupting gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor signaling in metabolic disorders including extreme fat deposition with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. These results propose the hypothesis that hyper GIP secretion may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans. However most studies have focused on incretin responses to glucose loading and the association between endogenous GIP levels and cardiometabolic disorders has not been well defined in humans. Methods and Results- To examine the association between fasting GIP and cardiometabolic disorders or CVD independent of plasma glucose (PG) levels we analysed 300 non-diabetic subjects. Furthermore we performed in vitro functional analysis using human macrophage cells. Simple regression analysis demonstrated that the fasting total GIP was correlated with cardiometabolic disorders such as waist to hip ratio hyperinsulinemia and HOMA-IR. ANCOVA and logistic analysis after adjustment for age gender BMI smoking HOMA-IR hypertension LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol eGFR and PG revealed that fasting GIP was increased in the subjects with CVD than non-CVD (53.7 +/- 32.2 v.s. 28.2 +/- 18.1 p<0.01) and each tertile increase in fasting GIP was associated with the prevalence of CVD (odds ratio 3.12 per tertile 95% CI 1.73 to 5.62; p <0.01). Furthermore molecular analysis revealed that GIP receptor was present in human monocyte/macrophage T-lymphocyte and human carotid atherosclerotic lesion. In vitro analysis revealed that GIP stimulation up-regulated gene expression of interleukin 6 CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 2 CCR5 and scavenger receptor type A in human THP-1 macrophages. Conclusions- These results suggest that oversecretion of GIP may contribute to cardiometabolic disorder resulting in the development of CVD independent of PG in humans.",NA,"21 SUPPL. 1",NA,"126","0009-7322",727,"In_database","unique"

We have recently reported that circulating GIP levels were associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In contrast emerging studies have demonstrated the cardioprotective effect of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. To clarify the influence of endogenous incretin levels on cardiovascular system we elucidated the interaction between fasting GIP and GLP-1 in 122 subjects and we performed in vitro molecular analysis. Simple regression analysis demonstrated that the fasting GIP was inversely correlated with fasting GLP-1 (r=-0.21 p=0.04). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the GIP/GLP-1 ratio was associated with known cardiovascular risk factors such as visceral fat area (beta=0.28 p<0.01) fasting insulin (beta=0.36 p<0.001) HOMA-IR (beta=0.30 p<0.001) total cholesterol (beta=0.34 p<0.001) apolipoproteinB-48 (beta=0.37 p<0.001) remnant-like particle cholesterol (beta=0.28 p<0.01) leptin (beta=0.24 p<0.01) pulse wave velocity (beta=0.19 p<0.01) and carotid intima-media thickness (beta=0.28 p=0.02) after adjustment for age gender and fasting plasma glucose. To further clarify the mechanism of the link between GIP and atherosclerosis we analyzed the expression of GIPR in human carotid atherosclerotic lesion. RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that GIPR was present in human atherosclerotic lesion especially in macrophages. To identify the direct effect of GIP on macrophage we performed in vitro analysis. QRTPCR analysis demonstrated that GIP stimulation (100 nM for 24 hours) up-regulated the gene expression of interleukin 6 chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (CCR) 2 CCR5 and scavenger receptor type A in human THP-1 macrophages (all p<0.05 vs. control by unpaired t-test).

The present study aimed to examine the neuroprotective effects of rhGLP-1 (7-36) and its possible mechanisms against acute ischemia/reperfusion injuries induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in diabetic rats. The type 2 diabetic rat model was established by a combination of a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). RhGLP-1 (7-36) (20 40 80 mug/kg) was given intraperitoneally before reperfusion. The neuroprotective effects of rhGLP-1 (7-36) were evaluated by changes in neurological deficit scores and 235-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Changes in blood glucose were used to assess hypoglycemic effects. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) inducible nitric oxide syntheses (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide syntheses (eNOS) after MCAO/R administration (2 h and 46 h) were examined to investigate the possible mechanisms of RhGLP-1 (7-36).

Liraglutide improves glycaemic control lowers body weight and it is currently being evaluated of clinical trials to evaluate effects on cardiovascular disease. We have previously demonstrated liraglutide-mediated attenuation of induced plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells in vitro and significant improvement in endothelial function in vivo in the ApoE-/-mousemodel. AIM: The current study aimed to determine the in vivo effect of liraglutide on atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability in the ApoE-/- mouse model. METHODS: In vivo experiments utilized established disease or early onset disease protocols: 18 week old ApoE-/- mice on a high fat diet for 12 weeks were treated with either saline (vehicle) liraglutide (300 lg/kg twice daily s.c.) or liraglutide + exendin-9 (150 pmol/kg/ min s.c. osmotic mini-pump) for 4 weeks or 17 week old ApoE-/- mice on a normal chow diet were commenced on a high fat diet and treatment regime identical to protocol 1 for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Vascular reactivity studies identified improvement in endothelial function in liraglutide treated mice from protocol 1. Oil red O staining and intima to media ratio (IMR) analysis of atherosclerotic plaques from the aorta and brachiocephalic artery (BCA) identified a significant reduction in staining and IMR in liraglutide treated mice from protocol 2. A trend towards increased vascular smooth muscle cell content of BCA atherosclerotic lesions in liraglutide-treated mice from protocol 2 was identified suggesting a plaque stabilising effect associated with liraglutide treatment.

These mediators are responsible for the direct free radical damage to proximal tubular cells for increased SGLT2 expression increased production of collagen IV and extracellular matrix and activation of monocyte/macrophages able to cause endothelial injury. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors not only reduces the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulationthus improving metabolic control in diabetesbut also restores tubuloglomerular feedback by increasing glycosuria and distal urinary flow. However the most notable effect is due to inhibition of glucose entry to the proximal tubular cells. Glycosuria is toxic to the kidney: it harms glucosetransporting cells that is the proximal cells which contain SGLT2. In animal models SGLT2 inhibition reduces local production of oxygen-free radicals the formation of mesangial matrix and collagen IV glomerular infiltration by inflammatory cells and monocyte/macrophage-dependent arteriosclerosis. In humans SGLT2 have a demonstrated ability to reduce renal injury and cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Espana S.L.U.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0025-7753%2817%2930624-3","Supplement 1","35-43","147","0025-7753

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is an important complication of the heart independent of hypertension and coronary artery disease and is accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy easily leads to heart failure which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone which has various beneficial roles in the cardiovascular system and exendin-4 is a highly potent glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist. However the role of GLP-1 in cardiac hypertrophy remains unknown. Our study revealed that exendin-4 treatment ameliorated phenylephrine (PE)-induced cardiac hypertrophy which presented as decreased cardiac hypertrophic markers (ANP BNP and beta-MHC) and cell surface area. This condition was significantly reversed upon treatment with the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin9-39. We also discovered that Erk1/2 and AMPK signaling pathways were involved in this process. Furthermore our data demonstrate that the AMPK inhibitor compound C inhibited the anti-hypertrophic effect of exendin-4 which is associated with the mTOR/p70S6K/4-EBP1 signaling pathway. Finally exendin-4 enhanced the anti-hypertrophic effect of rapamycin. In summary our study disclosed that exedin-4 inhibits cardiac hypertrophy by upregulating GLP-1 receptor expression and activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although microRNA-155-5p (miR-155-5p) which increases IL-6 expression is upregulated by LPS and hyperlipidemia and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia less frequently develop diabetes the role of miR-155-5p in the islet stress response to hyperlipidemia is unclear. In this study we demonstrate that hyperlipidemia-associated endotoxemia upregulates miR-155-5p in murine pancreatic beta-cells which improved glucosemetabolism and the adaptation of beta-cells to obesityinduced insulin resistance. This effect of miR-155-5p is because of suppression of v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family protein B which promotes b-cell function through IL-6-induced GLP-1 production in alpha-cells. Moreover reduced GLP-1 levels are associated with increased obesity progression dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic Mir155 knockout mice. Hence induction of miR-155-5p expression in beta-cells by hyperlipidemia-associated endotoxemia improves the adaptation of beta-cells to insulin resistance and represents a protective mechanism in the islet stress response.Copyright © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db17-0313","12","3072-3084","66","0012-1797

Less is understood however on how atherosclerosis is affected by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP). We report experimental evidence demonstrating that GIP has direct anti-atherosclerotic properties. Starting from the age of 17 weeks apolipoprotein (apo) E-null mice were placed on an atherogenic diet and administered daily subcutaneous infusions of vehicle (saline) GIP(1-42) (25 nmol/kg/day) GIP(3-42) (25nmol/kg/day) (Pro3)GIP (25nmol/kg/day) or GIP(1-42) plus (Pro3)GIP for 4 weeks. The infusions did not significantly affect body weight food intake plasma lipids or glucose. GIP(1-42) suppressed the atherosclerotic lesions in the whole aorta by 53% suppressed the plaque volume in the aortic valve by 38% and suppressed macrophage infilltration by 48% compared with the vehicle controls. In contrast GIP(3-42) had no effects on these atherosclerotic changes and the co-infusion of (Pro3)GIP abolished the anti-atherosclerotic effect of GIP(1-42). The infusion of (Pro3)GIP alone had no effect on the development of atherosclerosis. An oxidized LDL-induced foam cell formation was detected in the peritoneal macrophages obtained from apo E-null mice with various infusions. GIP(1- 42) infusion suppressed the foam cell formation by 30% whereas GIP(3-42) infusion had no suppressive effect whatsoever. Meanwhile the co-infusion with (Pro3)GIP nullifiled the suppressive effect of GIP(1-42). GIP receptor mRNA was detected in human and murine macrophages vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells by RT-PCR. GIP receptors were also histochemically stained in the vascular endothelium media and plaque of aorta in the apo E-null mice. GIP (1nM) in vitro suppressed the proliferation of smooth muscle cells determined by BrdU staining the gene expressions of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in endothelial cells and macrophage foam cell formation.

Starting from the age of 17 weeks apolipoprotein (apo) E-null mice were placed on an atherogenic diet and administered daily subcutaneous infusions of vehicle (saline) GIP(1-42) (25 nmol/kg/day) GIP(3-42) (25nmol/kg/day) (Pro3)GIP (25nmol/kg/day) or GIP(1-42) plus (Pro3)GIP for 4 weeks. The infusions did not significantly affect body weight food intake plasma lipids or glucose. GIP(1-42) suppressed the atherosclerotic lesions in the whole aorta by 53% suppressed the plaque volume in the aortic valve by 38% and suppressed macrophage infilltration by 48% compared with the vehicle controls. In contrast GIP(3-42) had no effects on these atherosclerotic changes and the co-infusion of (Pro3)GIP abolished the anti-atherosclerotic effect of GIP(1-42). The infusion of (Pro3)GIP alone had no effect on the development of atherosclerosis. An oxidized LDL-induced foam cell formation was detected in the peritoneal macrophages obtained from apo E-null mice with various infusions. GIP(1- 42) infusion suppressed the foam cell formation by 30% whereas GIP(3-42) infusion had no suppressive effect whatsoever. Meanwhile the co-infusion with (Pro3)GIP nullifiled the suppressive effect of GIP(1-42). GIP receptor mRNA was detected in human and murine macrophages vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells by RT-PCR. GIP receptors were also histochemically stained in the vascular endothelium media and plaque of aorta in the apo E-null mice. GIP (1nM) in vitro suppressed the proliferation of smooth muscle cells determined by BrdU staining the gene expressions of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in endothelial cells and macrophage foam cell formation. These results suggest that GIP has direct anti-atherosclerotic effects on the cells mainly responsible for atherogenesis via its own receptors.","http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db11-1625-1928","SUPPL. 1","A479","60","0012-1797",1386,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

A SGLT2i is a recently developed oral anti-diabetic agent which reduces plasma glucose levels by increasing urinary glucose excretion without affecting insulin secretion and action. We investigated how amelioration of glycaemia by SGLT2i is associated with macrophage-driven atherosclerosis in mouse models of type 1 and type2 diabetes. Materials and methods: Male Apoe-/- mice receiving injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg i.p x 5 daysn=34) or saline (n=31) were randomly assigned to SGLT2i treatment (dapagliflozin 1.0 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Male db/db diabetic mice were maintained on the food containing SGLT2i (ipragliflozin 1.0 mg/kg/day n=14) or none (n=30). After 4 weeks the peritoneal macrophages (Mphi) migrated by an i.p. injection of thioglycolate were collected to evaluate foam cell formation measured by incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-oleate into [<sup>3</sup>H]-cholesteryloleate in the presence of ox-LDL. In the Apoe-/- mice The atherosclerosis was assessed as en face atherosclerotic plaque area determined by oil red O staining. In the diabetic mice gene expressions related to foam cell formation in Mphi were examined by RT-PCR. Results: In the type1 diabetic Apoe-/- mice the SGLT2i decreased the fasting blood glucose (FBG) HbA1c and glucose-AUC after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared to vehicle. The body weight daily food intake systolic blood pressure or insulin and lipids were not changed by treatment with the SGLT2i in the diabetic and non-diabetic mice. In the diabetic Apoe-/- mice the atherosclerotic lesions and foam cell formation were accelerated compared to the non-diabetic counterparts (2-3 folds p<0.01) and significantly suppressed by the SGLT2i administration (33-34% p<0.01). The atherosclerotic lesions was highly correlated to the degree of foam cell formation (r=0.95 p<0.01 n=15) and the HbA1c levels (r=0.86 p<0.01 n=15) but insignificantly to the cholesterol levels (r=0.31 p=0.12). In the db/db type 2 diabetic mice with hyperinsulinemia the SGLT2i decreased the body weight levels of plasma triglycerides FBG and HbA1c and the glucose AUC with increased water intake by 3 times and doubled urine volume. Foam cell formation was suppressed by the SGLT2i (34% p<0.01) which correlated to the HbA1c levels (r=0.88 p<0.01 n=36) but insignificantly to lipid levels (r=-0.46 p=0.06) or insulin (r=-0.15 p=0.56). Gene expressions of scavenger receptors CD36 and Lox-1 and ACAT-1 a rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol esterification were up-regulated while ABCA1 a key molecule for cholesterol efflux was down-regulated in Mphi obtained from both diabetic mice.

"Terasaki M.Nagashima M.Nohtomi K.Kohashi K.Tomoyasu M.Shinmura K.Nogi Y.Sato K.Itoh F.Watanabe T.Hirano T.","The suppressive effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor on atherosclerosis is mainly attributable to the action of incretin in both non-diabetic and diabetic mice",2013,"Diabetologia","Background and aims: Several recent reports have revealed that dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors have a suppressive effect on atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. It remains to be seen however whether this suppressive effect stems from increased levels of the active incretins namely glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Methods: Male apolipoprotein E-null (Apoe-/-) mice and db/db mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 4 weeks. Diabetes was induced in a subset of the Apoe- /- mice by multiple injections of streptozotocin. Mice were administered the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin in drinking water over the same period. While receiving vildagliptin the mice were subcutaneously infused with either saline the GLP-1 receptor blocker exendin-9 (Ex-9) the GIP receptor blocker (Pro3)GIP or both Ex-9 and (Pro3)GIP via osmotic minipumps. Aortic atherosclerosis and oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation in exudate peritoneal macrophages were determined. The gene expressions of GLP-1 and GIP receptors were measured by RT-PCR using 10-11 primers covering all exons. The direct effect of DPP-4 on foam cell formation was also determined. Results: Vildagliptin treatment increased GLP-1 and GIP levels without affecting the food intake body weight blood pressure or plasma lipid profile though it reduced HbA1c only in diabetic mice. Diabetic Apoe-/- mice exhibited further-progressed atherosclerotic lesions and foam cell formation compared with nondiabetic counterparts. Nondiabetic and diabetic Apoe-/- mice showed a comparable response to vildagliptin namely remarkable suppression of atherosclerotic lesions with macrophage accumulation and foam cell formation in peritoneal macrophages. Ex-9 or Pro3 partially attenuated the vildagliptin-induced suppression of atherosclerosis. The two receptor blockers in combination abolished the anti-atherosclerotic effect of vildagliptin in nondiabetic mice but incompletely attenuated it in diabetic mice. Vildagliptin treatment also suppressed foam cell formation in peritoneal macrophages in nondiabetic Apoe-/- and diabetic (Apoe-/- and db/db) mice and this suppressive effect was abolished by infusions with Ex-9 plus Pro3. Gene expressions of GLP-1 and GIP receptors were detectable in peritoneal macrophages and J774 cells.

We investigated the possibility that glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) can prevent the development of atheroscrelosis in apolipoprotein E-null (ApoE-/-) mice. Materials and methods: GLP-1 (1.5 pmol/kg/min) or GIP (17 pmol/kg/min) was continuously infused for 4 weeks into 17-week-old ApoE-/-mice fed on atherogenic diet. Alternatively DPP-4 inhibitor (PKF275-055 Vildagliptin analogue Novartis) was administrated as drinking water for 4 weeks. Aortic atherosclerosis oxidized LDL-induced cholesterol ester accumulation (foam cell formation) and its related gene expression in exudate peritoneal macrophages were determined. Results: Administration of GLP-1 GIP or DPP-4 inhibitor did not affect food intake body weight blood pressure and plasma levels of lipids glucose and insulin. Remarkable atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta were observed in 21-week-old ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Administration of GLP-1 GIP or DPP-4 inhibitor significantly reduced the surface areas of atherosclerotic lesions and suppressed atheromatous plaque size and macrophage accumulation in the aortic root as compared with vehicle controls. The suppressive effects of incretins and DPP-4 inhibitor on atherosclerosis were associated with significant decreases in foam cell formation and down-regulation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and CD36 in exudate peritoneal macrophages.

"Zukowska Z.","Atherosclerosis and angiogenesis: what do nerves have to do with it?",2005,"Pharmacol Rep","Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a sympathetic neurotransmitter and a stress mediator with pleiotropic activities mediated by multiple receptors Y1-Y5. Originally known as an appetite stimulant and a vasoconstrictor NPY has recently emerged as a growth factor for a variety of cells from vascular smooth muscle to neural precursors - implicating the peptide in atherosclerosis and tissue remodeling. NPY is also potently angiogenic and was hailed as a potential candidate for a nerve-driven ischemic revascularization. To determine if the latter beneficial activity of the peptide can be separated from its deleterious pro-atherosclerotic action - receptor specificity and mechanisms of this ""Janus phenomenon"" were studied. Expression of Y2 receptors on the endothelium and Y1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle were required for angiogenic and pro-atherosclerotic activities respectively. Amplification of both activities was provided by co-expression of Y5 receptors. In rodent models limb ischemia up-regulated the NPY-Y2 system which contributed to post-ischemic revascularization; exogenous NPY further augmented it and nearly normalized blood flow and function of ischemic tissues. NPY-induced angiogenesis was also dependent on nitric oxide and endothelial dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV which converts NPY to Y2/Y5-selective agonist) but resistant to Y1 receptor blockade. Conversely vascular angioplasty up-regulated the NPY-Y1 system and promoted atherosclerosis and hyperplastic remodeling and these activities were blocked by Y1 receptor antagonist and augmented by DPPIV inhibitors. Thus drugs targeting specific NPY receptors may become new therapeutics against atherosclerosis/restenosis (Y1-selective antagonists) or for ischemic revascularization (Y2-selective agonists). Such drugs may be particularly beneficial for patients with elevated circulating NPY levels e.g. by chronic stress.",NA,NA,"229-34","57 Suppl","1734-1140 (Print)

Long-term studies have shown beneficial effects of monounsaturated fatty acids (eg oleic acid) on fasting lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in humans. A direct stimulatory effect of oleic acid on the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was shown in animal studies. Objective: We compared the postprandial responses of glucose insulin fatty acids triacylglycerol gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 to test meals rich in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Design: Ten young lean healthy persons ingested 3 meals: an energy-free soup consumed with 50 g carbohydrate (control meal) the control meal plus 100 g butter and the control meal plus 80 g olive oil. Triacylglycerol and retinyl palmitate responses were measured in total plasma in a chylomicron- rich fraction and in a chylomicron-poor fraction. Results: No significant differences in glucose insulin or fatty acid responses to the 2 fat-rich meals were seen. Plasma triacylglycerol responses were highest after the butter meal with chylomicron triacylglycerol rising 2.5-5-fold. Retinyl palmitate responses were higher and more prolonged after the butter meal than after the control and olive oil meals whereas both postprandial HDL- cholesterol concentrations and GLP-1 and GIP responses were higher after the olive oil meal than after the butter meal. Conclusions: Olive oil induced lower triacylglycerol concentrations and higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations than butter without eliciting differences in concentrations of glucose insulin or fatty acids. Furthermore olive oil induced higher concentrations of GLP-1 and GIP than did butter which may point to a relation between fatty acid composition incretin responses and triacylglycerol metabolism in the postprandial phase.",NA,"6","1135-1143","69","0002-9165",718,"In_database","unique"

Long-term studies have shown beneficial effects of monounsaturated fatty acids (eg oleic acid) on fasting lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in humans. A direct stimulatory effect of oleic acid on the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was shown in animal studies. Objective: We compared the postprandial responses of glucose insulin fatty acids triacylglycerol gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 to test meals rich in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Design: Ten young lean healthy persons ingested 3 meals: an energy-free soup consumed with 50 g carbohydrate (control meal) the control meal plus 100 g butter and the control meal plus 80 g olive oil. Triacylglycerol and retinyl palmitate responses were measured in total plasma in a chylomicron- rich fraction and in a chylomicron-poor fraction. Results: No significant differences in glucose insulin or fatty acid responses to the 2 fat-rich meals were seen. Plasma triacylglycerol responses were highest after the butter meal with chylomicron triacylglycerol rising 2.5-5-fold. Retinyl palmitate responses were higher and more prolonged after the butter meal than after the control and olive oil meals whereas both postprandial HDL- cholesterol concentrations and GLP-1 and GIP responses were higher after the olive oil meal than after the butter meal. Conclusions: Olive oil induced lower triacylglycerol concentrations and higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations than butter without eliciting differences in concentrations of glucose insulin or fatty acids. Furthermore olive oil induced higher concentrations of GLP-1 and GIP than did butter which may point to a relation between fatty acid composition incretin responses and triacylglycerol metabolism in the postprandial phase.",NA,"6","1135-1143","69","0002-9165",1466,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Conference: American Heart Association","INTRODUCTION: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is cardioprotective during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). We have identified a novel cardiac sodium glucose cotransporter SGLT1 and determined that it is upregulated in transgenic mice with a mutation leading to AMPK hyperactivation. Therefore we hypothesized that SGLT1 is a downstream target of AMPK and is involved in the cardiac response to I/R. METHODS AND RESULTS: HL-1 cells treated in vitro with the AMPK activator AICAR (1mM) for 24 h had a 2.89+/-0.6 fold increase in SGLT1 mRNA (vs. vehicle N=3 P<0.01) which was abrogated by the AMPK inhibitor compound C (10 muM). Simulated ischemia in HL-1 cells with NaCN (5 mM for 4 h) increased SGLT1 expression 3.6+/-1.3 fold (N=5 P<0.005) which was abrogated by compound C. SGLT1 RNAi in HL-1 cells improved cell survival following 4 h of ischemia from 52+/-2% to 86+/-3% (P<0.002). Transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of SGLT1 (TGSGLT1-DOWN) and wildtype (WT) littermates were subjected to ex vivo global ischemia for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 40 min. TGSGLT1-DOWN mice had improved post-ischemic peak systolic pressure vs. WT (67.6+/-3.0 vs. 44.6+/-2.5 mmHg N=7 P<0.01). Post-ischemic dp/dt and -dp/dt were 1420+/-193.8 and -746.0 +/-80.11 respectively in TGSGLT1-DOWN both were significantly higher vs. WT (768.0+/-101.2 and -462.6+/-40.46 respectively N=8 P<0.01). TGSGLT1-DOWN mice and WT littermates were subjected to in vivo regional I/R with 30 min of left anterior descending coronary artery ligation followed by 4 h of reperfusion. TGSGLT1-DOWN mice had a decreased ratio of infarct size to area at risk (AAR) vs. WT (0.03+/-0.01 vs. 0.14+/-0.03 N=3 P<0.05). TGSGLT1-DOWN mice exhibited decreased oxidative stress vs. WT (MDA 104+/-5 vs. 140+/-10 nmol/g tissue N=4 P<0.05) and had decreased expression of the NOX2 subunit gp91 phox expression. CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is an upstream regulator of cardiac SGLT1. Although AMPK generally mediates cardioprotection in I/R transgenic knockdown of SGLT1 in mice improved post-I/R functional recovery decreased infarction size and decreased oxidative stress.

In addition to reducing blood glucose SGLT2 inhibitors produce unexpectedly robust reductions in hospitalization and death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and reduce other CVD risk factors such as blood pressure body weight adiposity insulin resistance and in some cases circulating triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. These effects cannot be completely explained by improved glycemic control. Alternative mecha-nisms to explain the profound cardiovascular effects of these drugs are unknown. Recently our lab has shown that canagliflozin inhibits mito-chondrial complex I leading to AMPK activation and decreased lipogenesis but whether this is important for reducing inflammation and atherosclerosis is not known. Here we show canagliflozin but not dapagliflozin or empagliflozin dose dependently reduces markers of inflammation including phosphorylation of C-Jun NH2-terminal Kinase (JNK) and inter-leukin-1 Beta (IL-1b) secretion in bone marrow derived macrophages in an AMPK dependent and NLRP3 independent manner. To determine cana-gliflozin's effects on atherosclerosis female ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AMPKb1<sup>-/-</sup>mice were fed a Western Diet and orally gavaged with either vehicle or 30mg/kg canagliflozin for 6 weeks. Canagliflozin treatment did not reduce body weight and only resulted in modest improvements in glycemic pa-rameters however there was a reduction in hepatic lipogenesis independent of AMPK. Canagliflozin did not reduce atherosclerotic plaque development in this model however circulating inflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa) Il-1b and Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) were reduced inan AMPK-dependent manner. Although this model did not result in a decrease in atherosclerosis canagliflozin treatment reduced both hepatic lipogenesis and markers systemic inflammation providing insights into a mechanism of action for this drug beyond SGLT2 inhibition. These findings may help explain the robust protective effects of canagliflozin on CVD in humans.","DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosissup.2018.04.354",NA,"114-115","32","1567-5688",1508,"In_database","duplicate"

However thus far no effective treatment strategy is available for HT prevention in routine clinical practice. While the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4) is known to protect against oxidative stress and neuronal cell death caused by ischemic brain damage its effect on preventing warfarin-associated HT after cerebral ischemia is yet unknown. Therefore we hypothesized that Ex-4 would stabilize the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and suppress neuroinflammation through PI3K-Akt-induced inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) after warfarin-associated HT post-cerebral ischemia. Methods: We used male C57BL/6 mice for all experiments. A 5-mg warfarin sodium tablet was dissolved in animals' drinking water (effective warfarin uptake 0.04 mg (2 mg/kg) per mouse). The mice were fed for 0 6 12 and 24 h with ad libitum access to the treated water. To study the effects of Ex-4 temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed. Then either Ex-4 (10 mg/kg) or saline was injected through the tail vein and in the Ex-4+wortmannin group PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was intravenously injected after reperfusion. The infarct volume neurological deficits and integrity of the BBB were assessed 72 h post MCAO. One- or two-way ANOVA was used to test the difference between means followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc testing for pair-wise comparison. Results: We observed that Ex-4 ameliorated warfarin-associated HT and preserved the integrity of the BBB after cerebral ischemia through the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. Furthermore Ex-4 suppressed oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels and suppressed microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration in warfarin-associated HT post-cerebral ischemia. However these effects were totally abolished in the mice treated with Ex-4 + the PI3K inhibitor-wortmannin. The PI3K/Akt-GSK-3beta signaling pathway appeared to contribute to the protection afforded by Ex-4 in the warfarin-associated HT model. Conclusions: GLP-1 administration could reduce warfarin-associated HT in mice.

K.","The GLP-1 receptor agonists exendin-4 and liraglutide alleviate oxidative stress and cognitive and micturition deficits induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in diabetic mice",2016,"BMC Neuroscience","Background: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs protect a variety of cell types against oxidative damage and vascular and neuronal injury via binding to GLP-1 receptors. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the GLP-1 analogs exendin-4 and liraglutide on cerebral blood flow reactive oxygen species production expression of oxidative stress-related proteins cognition and pelvic sympathetic nerve-mediated bladder contraction after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) injury in the db/db mouse model of diabetes. Results: Sixty minutes of MCAO increased blood and brain reactive oxygen species counts in male db/db mice as revealed by dihydroethidium staining. MCAO also increased nuclear factor-KB and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and decreased cerebral microcirculation. These effects were attenuated by treatment with exendin-4 or liraglutide. MCAO did not affect basal levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS); however exendin-4 and liraglutide treatments significantly enhanced p-Akt and p-eNOS levels indicating activation of the p-Akt/p-eNOS signaling pathway. MCAO-induced motor and cognitive deficits and micturition dysfunction indicated by reduced pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions and increased nonvoiding contractions were also partially attenuated by exendin-4 treatment. Conclusions: The above data indicate that treatment with GLP-1 agonists exerts protective effects against oxidative inflammatory and apoptotic damage in brain areas that control parasympathetic/pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions and cognitive and motor behaviors in a diabetic mouse model.

Confluent brain endothelial cells cocultured with astrocytes were exposed to varying degrees of in vitro stroke conditions. Glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 and sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) activity were investigated by luminal membrane uptake and transport studies using [<sup>3</sup>H]D-glucose and also by [<sup>14</sup>C]alpha-methyl D-glucopyranoside (AMG) a specific nonmetabolized substrate of SGLT. In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion experiments were tested to determine whether blood-brain barrier (BBB) SGLT activity was induced during ischemia. Increases in luminal D-glucose and AMG uptake and transport were observed with in vitro stroke conditions. Specific inhibitor experiments suggest a combined role for both SGLT and GLUT1 at the BBB during OGD. A time-dependent increase in the uptake of AMG was also seen in mice exposed to permanent focal ischemia and this increase was sensitive to the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin. Infarct and edema ratio during ischemia were significantly decreased by the inhibition of this transporter. These results show that both GLUT1 and SGLT play a role at the BBB in the blood-to-brain transport of glucose during ischemic conditions and inhibition of SGLT during stroke has the potential to improve stroke outcome. Pharmacological modulation of this novel BBB transporter could prove to be a brain vascular target in stroke.

Glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 and sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) activity were investigated by luminal membrane uptake and transport studies using [3H]D-glucose and also by [14C]alpha-methyl D-glucopyranoside (AMG) a specific nonmetabolized substrate of SGLT. In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion experiments were tested to determine whether blood-brain barrier (BBB) SGLT activity was induced during ischemia. Increases in luminal D-glucose and AMG uptake and transport were observed with in vitro stroke conditions. Specific inhibitor experiments suggest a combined role for both SGLT and GLUT1 at the BBB during OGD. A time-dependent increase in the uptake of AMG was also seen in mice exposed to permanent focal ischemia and this increase was sensitive to the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin. Infarct and edema ratio during ischemia were significantly decreased by the inhibition of this transporter. These results show that both GLUT1 and SGLT play a role at the BBB in the blood-to-brain transport of glucose during ischemic conditions and inhibition of SGLT during stroke has the potential to improve stroke outcome. Pharmacological modulation of this novel BBB transporter could prove to be a brain vascular target in stroke.

It has been reported that an increase in brain edema after ischemic stroke worsens long-term clinical outcome.

METHODS: Atherosclerosis development was evaluated in Apoe (-/-) Irs2 (+/-) mice a mouse model of insulin resistance the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis treated with the GLP-1 analogues lixisenatide or liraglutide. In addition studies in Apoe (-/-) Irs2 (+/-) mice and mouse-derived macrophages treated with lixisenatide were performed to investigate the potential inflammatory intracellular pathways. RESULTS: Treatment of Apoe (-/-) Irs2 (+/-) mice with either lixisenatide or liraglutide improved glucose metabolism and blood pressure but this was independent of body weight loss. Both drugs significantly decreased atheroma plaque size. Compared with vehicle-treated control mice lixisenatide treatment generated more stable atheromas with fewer inflammatory infiltrates reduced necrotic cores and thicker fibrous caps. Lixisenatide-treated mice also displayed diminished IL-6 levels proinflammatory Ly6C(high) monocytes and activated T cells. In vitro analysis showed that in macrophages from Apoe (-/-) Irs2 (+/-) mice lixisenatide reduced the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 accompanied by enhanced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 which is a determinant for M2 macrophage differentiation.

Compared with vehicle-treated control mice lixisenatide treatment generated more stable atheromas with fewer inflammatory infiltrates reduced necrotic cores and thicker fibrous caps. Lixisenatide-treated mice also displayed diminished IL-6 levels proinflammatory Ly6C(high) monocytes and activated T cells. In vitro analysis showed that in macrophages from Apoe (-/-) Irs2 (+/-) mice lixisenatide reduced the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 accompanied by enhanced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 which is a determinant for M2 macrophage differentiation. STAT1 activation which is essential for M1 phenotype was also diminished. Furthermore atheromas from lixisenatide-treated mice showed higher arginase I content and decreased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase indicating the prevalence of the M2 phenotype within plaques. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Lixisenatide decreases atheroma plaque size and instability in Apoe (-/-) Irs2 (+/-) mice by reprogramming macrophages towards an M2 phenotype which leads to reduced inflammation.

We assessed this hypothesis first by measuring IgG IgM and IgA antibodies against CD26 CD69 streptokinase (SK) gliadin and casein peptides and against ethyl mercury bound to human serum albumin in patients with autism. A significant percentage of children with autism developed anti-SK anti-gliadin and casein peptides and anti-ethyl mercury antibodies concomitant with the appearance of anti-CD26 and anti-CD69 autoantibodies. These antibodies are synthesized as a result of SK gliadin casein and ethyl mercury binding to CD26 and CD69 indicating that they are specific.

MCAO also increased nuclear factor-KB and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and decreased cerebral microcirculation. These effects were attenuated by treatment with exendin-4 or liraglutide. MCAO did not affect basal levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS); however exendin-4 and liraglutide treatments significantly enhanced p-Akt and p-eNOS levels indicating activation of the p-Akt/p-eNOS signaling pathway. MCAO-induced motor and cognitive deficits and micturition dysfunction indicated by reduced pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions and increased nonvoiding contractions were also partially attenuated by exendin-4 treatment. Conclusions: The above data indicate that treatment with GLP-1 agonists exerts protective effects against oxidative inflammatory and apoptotic damage in brain areas that control parasympathetic/pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions and cognitive and motor behaviors in a diabetic mouse model.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0272-9","1","37","17","1471-2202",1103,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Specific probiotics have anti-inflammatory effects and may reduce bacterial translocation. We thereby tested whether a probiotic mixture with documented anti-inflammatory potential could reduce atherosclerosis. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed high fat diet alone or with VSL#3 or a positive control treatment telmisartan or both for 12 weeks. All treatments reduced atherosclerotic plaques significantly compared to high fat diet alone. VSL#3 significantly reduced proinflammatory adhesion molecules and risk factors of plaque rupture reduced vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis to a comparable extent to telmisartan; and VSL#3 treated mice had the most distinctly different intestinal microbiota composition from the control groups. Combining the VSL#3 and telmisartan brought no further benefits. Our findings showed the therapeutic potential of VSL#3 in reducing atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation.

Materials andmethods: The STZ induced diabetic ApoE-/- mice were fed with a high-fat diet to establish the experimental diabetic atherosclerosis mouse models. C57BL/6J mice served as control group and they were fed with a general diet. ApoE-/- mice were intragastrically administrated with dapagliflozin 1mg/kg.d or vehicle for 12w treatment and thereafter their aortas were collected for oil red O staining to analyze the area of lesion and for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining to observe the pathologically morphological changes. The IL-1beta IL- 18 and NLRP3 inflammasome in the serum were tested by ELISA the macrophage infiltration in the lesion and the stability of lesion were detected by immunofluorescence and the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome IL-1beta and IL-18 in aorta were analyzed by Western blot. Results: Dapagliflozin decreased the blood glucose by 43% in diabetic ApoE-/- mice (P<0.01) and 28% in non-diabetic ApoE-/- mice (P<0.05) respectively; and it lowered FFA and TG in diabetic ApoE-/- mice (P<0.05). Oil red O staining results of aorta showed that dapagliflozin inhibited the formation of aortic atherosclerosis in diabetic ApoE-/- mice (P<0.05). The serum ELISA results demonstrated that dapagliflozin decreased the serum levels of IL-1beta IL-18 and NLRP3 in diabetic ApoE-/- mice (P<0.05) while it only reduced the serum IL-1beta level in non-diabetic ApoE-/- mice (P<0.05). The immunofluorescence results of aortic root indicated that dapagliflozin reduced macrophage infiltration in the lesion prevented the reduction of smooth muscle cells and increased the stability of lesion in diabetic mice. The Western blot results of abdominal aorta indicated that dapagliflozin suppressed the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in abdominal aorta of diabetic ApoE-/- mice and decreased the production and release of mature IL-1beta and IL-18. Conclusion: Dapagliflozin can improve the formation of atherosclerotic lesion by lowering blood glucose and lipid inhibit the macrophage infiltration of aorta and reduce the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome thus hindering the production and release of IL-1beta and IL-18 and relieving the inflammatory reaction in atherosclerosis.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-016-4046-9","1 Supplement 1","S30-S31","59","0012-186X",1142,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

Conference: American Heart Association/American Stroke Association","Background: Carotid Atherosclerotic (CA) plaque rupture is associated with ischemic stroke. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) play key role in plaque development. SMC also produce collagen fibers and maintain the fibrous cap thickness and strength and SMC apoptosis and inflammation can lead to plaque rupture. Molecular mechanisms leading to plaque instability and stroke are not completely understood. Our study has shown that an adipokine dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV) is significantly upregulated in post-stroke rat brain and in the plasma of over 75% of CA patients suggesting a role for DPPIV in CA and stroke. In this study we examined the effects of DPPIV on SMC viability apoptosis and identified responsible signaling pathways. Methods: Mouse carotid artery SMC were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Cells were treated with either physiological (200-500 ng/ml) or high (1000-2000 ng/ml) dose of DPPIV. Using transcriptome array we examined the expression profile of apoptotic and inflammatory pathway specific genes in these cells. DPPIV levels were examined by PCR and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay was used to assess cell viability. Live/dead cell assay detected apoptosis. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected using tetra-methyl-rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). Results: Ischemia/hypoxia upregulates DPPIV mRNA and protein levels in association with increased pro-apoptotic genes including caspase 7 Nod1 and Gadd45a. Transcriptome array data demonstrated that higher dose of exogenous DPPIV results in significant increase in same pro-apoptotic pathway genes including caspase 37 Nod1 Trp63 and Gadd45a. On the other hand DPPIV decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic genes including Atf5 and Birc3. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL1-beta and Ccl26/Eotaxin were increased in both DPPIV and ischemic SMCs. Higher dose of DPPIV increased apoptosis decreased viability and mitochondrial membrane potential in SMCs. Conclusion: Higher levels of DPP4 activates the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling cascade resulting in the apoptosis of SMC.

We identified 60 studies that report associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and human brain structure/function. Forty-three studies measured candidate loci DNAm; seventeen measured epigenome-wide DNAm. MRI features included region-of-interest and whole-brain structural diffusion and functional imaging features. The studies report DNAm-MRI associations for: neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders; major depression and suicidality; alcohol use disorder; schizophrenia and psychosis; ageing stroke ataxia and neurodegeneration; post-traumatic stress disorder; and socio-emotional processing. Consistency between MRI features and differential DNAm is modest. Sources of bias: variable inclusion of comparator groups; different surrogate tissues used; variation in DNAm measurement methods; lack of control for genotype and cell-type composition; and variations in image processing. Knowledge of MRI features associated with differential DNAm may improve understanding of the role of DNAm in brain health and disease but caution is required because conventions for linking DNAm and MRI data are not established and clinical and methodological heterogeneity in existing literature is substantial.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.03.007",NA,NA,NA,"0149-7634",1845,"In_database","unique"

OBJECTIVES: To test if NEP activity/expression are reduced in COPD lung and if so to investigate some of the major cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible. METHODS: Lung lysates from 'control' and advanced COPD patients (n=9-14) were analyzed for NEP activity protein (western) and mRNA (qRTPCR) expression and as a control dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. Fixed lung sections were scored for pulmonary vascular remodeling and examined for oxidant damage. Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PA SMCs) were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) hypoxia or H2O2 to partially model conditions present in COPD. PA SMCs were preincubated in some cases with the antioxidant Tiron or the lysosome inhibitor Folimycin to determine what roles ROS or protein degradative mechanisms may have in decreasing NEP activity/expression upon exposure of PA SMCs to CSE hypoxia or H2O2. RESULTS: In COPD lungs NEP activity was reduced by 76% whereas NEP protein and mRNA expression were reduced to lesser extents. Lung activity of the similar lung peptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV was not changed demonstrating that changes observed with NEP appear to be selective. COPD lungs show increased pulmonary vascular remodeling including distal medial thickening compared to 'control' lungs.

However the effect of evogliptin on the atherosclerotic progression has not been evaluated. In the present study we examined the effects of evogliptin on the progression of atherosclerosis and its possible mechanism of action. Evogliptin reduced high fat diet-induced plaque area in ApoE-knockout mouse model. Evogliptin significantly suppressed the expression of adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 and VCAM by ox-LDL a proatherogenic risk factor in human endothelial cells. NF-kB activation was dose dependently inhibited by evogliptin. PPARgamma suppressed by ox-LDL was reversed by evogliptin.

The metabolic syndrome for example is diagnosed and monitored by blood and urine indices such as blood cholesterol levels. Nevertheless the association between the molecular and the physiological manifestations of the disease especially in response to treatment has not been investigated in a systematic manner. To this end we studied a mouse model of diet-induced dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis that was subject to various drug treatments relevant to the disease in question. Both physiological data and gene expression data (from the liver and white adipose) were analyzed and compared. We find that treatments that restore gene expression patterns to their norm are associated with the successful restoration of physiological markers to their baselines. This holds in a tissue-specific manner - treatments that reverse the transcriptomic signatures of the disease in a particular tissue are associated with positive physiological effects in that tissue. Further treatments that introduce large non-restorative gene expression alterations are associated with unfavorable physiological outcomes. These results provide a sound basis to in silico methods that rely on omic metrics for drug repurposing and drug discovery by searching for compounds that reverse a disease's omic signatures. Moreover they highlight the need to develop drugs that restore the global cellular state to its healthy norm rather than rectify particular disease phenotypes.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 is a treatment for type 2 diabetes that prevents the inactivation of glucagonlike peptide (GLP)-1 and therefore increases levels of active GLP-1. In addition to their glycaemic actions DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in several experimentalmodels. Specifically our research group has shown that the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin is efficacious against stroke in normal and type 2 diabetic and obese mice. However the mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitor-mediated neuroprotection remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of linagliptin against stroke is mediated by GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation by performing stroke efficacy studies in normal versus knockout mice lacking the GLP-1R (Glp1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice). Materials and methods: Adult male mice with or without functional disruption of GLP-1R were treated orally with linagliptin 10 mg/kg/day or vehicle for 7 weeks. There were 4 experimental groups: Glp1r<sup>-/-</sup> plus linagliptin n=9; Glp1r<sup>-/-</sup>plus vehicle n=8; wild type plus linagliptin n=9; wild type plus vehicle n=9. After 4 weeks of treatment the mice were subjected to 30 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion to induce ischaemic stroke. Drug treatment was continued for 3 additional weeks until sacrifice. The severity of the ischaemic damage was measured by evaluating the stroke volume and by stereological counting of NeuNpositive surviving neurons in the striatum and cortex. Results: Linagliptin treatment resulted in a strong trend albeit not statistically significant towards a reduction of ischaemic volume in wild type mice (mean linagliptin=6.5 mm<sup>3</sup> vs mean vehicle=11.8 mm3). In the Glp1r<sup>-/-</sup>mice the effect of linagliptin on the reduction of ischaemic volume reached significance (mean linagliptin=18.8 mm3 vs mean vehicle=7.9 mm<sup>3</sup>; p<0.001). The results also showed that linagliptin treatment resulted in a significant reduction of stroke damage in both wild type (mean linagliptin=2.27x10<sup>6</sup> vs mean vehicle=1.62x10<sup>6</sup>; p<0.05) and Glp1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice (mean linagliptin=2.07x10<sup>6</sup> vs mean vehicle=1.18x10<sup>6</sup>; p<0.0005) as measured by the number of surviving neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Conclusion: These results indicate that linagliptin-induced neuroprotection is mediated by a GLP-1R-independent mechanism. Because DPP-4 inhibitors can also increase the levels of other DPP-4 substrates that may have beneficial effects in the brain our results should provide a strong rationale for identifying these factors.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3687-4",NA,"S35","1)","0012-186X",443,"In_database","unique"

Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 is a treatment for type 2 diabetes that prevents the inactivation of glucagonlike peptide (GLP)-1 and therefore increases levels of active GLP-1. In addition to their glycaemic actions DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in several experimentalmodels. Specifically our research group has shown that the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin is efficacious against stroke in normal and type 2 diabetic and obese mice. However the mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitor-mediated neuroprotection remains largely unknown.

Blood samples were drawn at the end of 10 weeks and abdominal aorta was dissected for histopathological examination. Serum insulin GLP-1 apelin visfatin and nitrotyrosine concentrations were measured by the manufacturer's kits based on ELISA; asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and arginine levels were measured by the high performance liquid chromatography. Homocysteine level was measured by the chemiluminescence immunoassay; glucose total chol and triglyceride levels were measured by the autoanalyzer. The microscopic examination of aorta indicated varying degrees of vascular disturbance in chol- and chol + meth-fed groups. High levels of chol and homocysteine accompanied with significantly low levels of apelin and GLP-1 were detected in the plasma. Visfatin ADMA and nitrotyrosine levels both in chol- and chol + meth-fed groups were significantly higher than those in control animals whereas arginine and arginine/ADMA ratio were lower. This study indicated that circulating levels of apelin GLP-1 and visfatin are markedly altered during the development of atherosclerotic changes in close association with chol homocysteine NO and ADMA levels. The measurements of these peptides in serum may help for the diagnosis and follow-up of vascular dysfunction.","10.1007/s11010-014-2263-4","01-Feb","69-75","400","0300-8177",826,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

"Yamazaki Y.Harada S.Tokuyama S.","Relationship between cerebral sodium-glucose transporter and hyperglycemia in cerebral ischemia",2015,"Neuroscience Letters","Post-ischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates the development of cerebral ischemia. To elucidate this exacerbation mechanism we focused on sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) as a mediator that lead hyperglycemia to cerebral ischemia. SGLT transport glucose into the cell together with sodium ion using the sodium concentration gradient. We have previously reported that suppression of cerebral SGLT ameliorates cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. However detail relationship cerebral between SGLT and post-ischemic hyperglycemia remain incompletely defined. Therefore we examined the involvement of cerebral SGLT on cerebral ischemic neuronal damage with or without hyperglycemic condition. Cell survival rate of primary cultured neurons was assessed by biochemical assay. A mouse model of focal ischemia was generated using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neuronal damage was assessed with histological and behavioral analyses. Concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment exacerbated hydrogen peroxide alone-induced cell death. Although a SGLT family-specific inhibitor phlorizin had no effect on developed hydrogen peroxide alone-induced cell death it suppressed cell death induced by concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment. alpha-MG induced a concentration-dependent and significant decrease in neuronal survival. PHZ administered on immediately after reperfusion had no effect but PHZ given at 6. h after reperfusion had an effect. Our in vitro study indicates that SGLT is not involved in neuronal cell death in non-hyperglycemic condition. We have already reported that post-ischemic hyperglycemia begins to develop at 6. h after MCAO.

An in vivo mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia was generated using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The development of infarct volume and behavioral abnormalities on day 3 after MCAO were ameliorated in cerebral SGLT-1 knock down mice. Cortical and striatal SGLT-1 expression levels were significantly increased at 12 h after MCAO. Immunofluorescence revealed that SGLT-1 and the neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) were co-localized in the cortex and striatum of MCAO mice. In the in vitro study primary cortical neurons were cultured for five days before each treatment with reagents. Concomitant treatment with hydrogen peroxide and glucose induced the elevation of SGLT-1 and phosphorylated AMPK/AMPK ratio and this elevation was suppressed by compound C an AMPK inhibitor in primary cortical neurons. Moreover compound C suppressed neuronal cell death induced by concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment in primary cortical neurons. Therefore we concluded that enhanced cerebral SGLT-1 function mediated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. One of the mechanisms of cerebral SGLT-1 up-regulation may be involved in the AMPK activation after cerebral ischemia.Copyright © 2015 IBRO.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.10.005",NA,"674-685","310","0306-4522

Because the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) agonist prevents cardiovascular injury we investigated the beneficial effects and mechanism of the GLP-1 analogue exenatide on stress-related vascular senescence and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet. METHODS: ApoE(-/-) mice fed the HF diet were assigned to non-stressed and immobilized-stress groups for 12 weeks. Mice fed the HF diet were divided into 2 groups and administered vehicle or exenatide for 12 weeks under stress conditions.

The stress increased the levels of plasma depeptidyl peptidase-4 activity and decreased the levels of plasma GLP-1 and both plasma and adipose adiponectin (APN).

Methods: ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were randomized into groups fed for 12 weeks and randomly tested with HE staining and oil red O staining. Next they were administered different drug interventions for 6 weeks. Fasting serum insulin and the levels of hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and selective precipitation assays. The protein expression levels of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in the aorta were studied by Western blot. Results: Fed with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks the high-fat diet group showed early plaque formation of atherosclerosis but had not yet formed the lipid core or the thickening intima-media thickness. Oil red O staining showed that the high-fat diet group had more plaques of atherosclerosis. The insulin and hsCRP levels of the exenatide high-dose group were significantly decreased (P<0.05). LDL-C levels in both the exenatide and sitagliptin groups were lower than the non-drug intervention group and the atorvastatin group (P<0.05).

The effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors which increase the endogenous levels of GLP1 on myocardial protection are unknown. Hypothesis: Sitagliptin (SIT) and PIO have additive effects on IS limitation in the mouse via different mechanisms. Methods: Mice received 3-day oral SIT (300 mg/kg/day) PIO (5 mg/kg/day) their combination or water alone. On the 4th day rats underwent 30 min coronary artery occlusion and 4 h reperfusion. In addition mice received i.v. H89 (20 mg/kg a PKA inhibitor) or vehicle 1 h before coronary occlusion. Results: Body weight left ventricular weight and area at risk (AR) sizewere comparable among group. IS in the control group (cont)was 44.3+/-3.2% of the AR. SIT (24.0+/-2.4%) and PIO (22.0+/-1.0%) significantly reduced IS. IS in the SIT+PIO group was significantly smaller than in the other groups (14.7+/-0.7%). H89 alone had no effect (45.5+/-1.8%) but it completely blocked the effect of SIT (45.3+/-4.1%) and partially blocked the effect of PIO (33.5+/-2.3%). cAMP levels were 4.49+/-0.21 pmol/mug in the cont.

However it is not easy by conventional treatments to maintain a long-term good glycemic control while avoiding weight gain. GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide is expected not only to improve glycemic control but also to exhibit antiatherosclerotic effect. The antiatherosclerotic effects of exenatide were reported in some animal models but the reports in human are rare. The intina-media thickness (IMT) by ultrasound evaluation of carotid artery is known to be correlated with stroke or myocardial infarction and is a good indicator for arteriosclerosis. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of exenatide for prevention of arterioscrelosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods: The subjects of exenatide group were 56 outpatients with type 2 diabetes (25 men and 31women) aged 63.8+/-11.0 years old BMI 27.7+/-6.1 and with HbA1c higher than 6.9% or below 6.9% but with repeating hypoglycemia by past treatment with OHA and/or insulin. The control group was 50 age- HbA1c- and BMI-matched subjects with type 2 diabetes. In the exenatide group exenatide was prescribed in addition to the previous treatment for 12 months 5 mcg at first and 10 mcg after 1 month twice daily in the morning and evening.

Results: Three patients discontinued the use of exenatide because of nausea. After the start of exenatide max IMT was significantly decreased from 2.07+/-0.79 to 1.91+/-0.72 (p=0.00023) and mean IMT was decreased from 1.09+/-0.33 to 1.02+/-0.31 (p=0.065) although the difference was not significant. On the other hand in the control group no significant change was seen in max IMT (from 1.90+/-0.55 to 1.99+/-0.68 (p=0.296)) nor mean IMT (from 1.08+/-0.27 to 1.13+/-0.34 (p=0.217)).

Moreover sitagliptin significantly reduced the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 in the aorta (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) as well as the serum levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin (both p < 0.05).

The Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycemia in Diabetes study (RECORD) compared cardiovascular morbidity-mortality outcomes in patients taking rosiglitazone in combination with metformin or sulfonylurea versus metformin with sulfonylurea. The results showed that rosiglitazone was not inferior to the metformin-sulfonylurea combination in terms of mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization but caution must be used when interpreting the results as the event rate was low. The BARI 2D study (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) is a cardiovascular morbidity-mortality trial with the goal of determining the best strategy for blood glucose control and revascularization in T2D patients with stable coronary artery disease. The results of this trial showed that early revascularization is not clearly beneficial except in a subgroup of patients in whom surgical revascularization is indicated. The use of GLP-1 analogs (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) in the acute phase of myocardial ischemia in animal models provided promising results. Some clinical studies also suggest an improvement in cardiovascular risk factors with these treatments. Results from morbidity-mortality studies are needed to better assess the long-term efficiency of these new drugs.","10.1016/j.ando.2010.09.001","6","505-10","71","0003-4266",831,"Duplicate_in_trash","duplicate"

"Zhong J.Rao X.Rajagopalan S.","An emerging role of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) beyond glucose control: potential implications in cardiovascular disease",2013,"Atherosclerosis","The introduction of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes acknowledges the fundamental importance of incretin hormones in the regulation of glycemia. Small molecule inhibitors of DPP4 exert their effects via inhibition of enzymatic degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). The widespread expression of DPP4 in tissues such as the vasculature and immune cells suggests that this protein may play a role in cardiovascular function. DPP4 is known to exert its effects via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. A soluble form of DPP4 lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain has also been recently recognized. Besides enzymatic inactivation of incretins DPP4 also mediates degradation of many chemokines and neuropeptides.

The N-terminus of mature CCL2 is blocked by a pyroglutamyl (pGlu) residue which confers resistance to cleavage by most aminopeptidases. pGlu is formed post-translationally from a glutaminyl precursor. The reaction is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclase (QC). Therefore inhibition of qC by small orally available compounds was assessed in terms of efficacy to promote inactivation of CCL2. Methods: The degradation of CCL2 by aminopeptidases and its effect on chemotactic potency and CCR2 receptor activation was studied in vitro. An application of specific inhibitors was used to study the importance of QC activity on monocyte-recruitment in a model of thioglycollate induced peritonitis in mice. In addition the effect of QC-inhibitors on monocyte recruitment and vascular pathology was investigated in ApoE3Leiden mice. Results: QC-inhibition facilitates CCL2 inactivation. The suppression of N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu) formation in plasma results in cleavage of CCL2 by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4 DP IV) which releases two N-terminal amino acids. Consequently QC-inhibition was efficacious in two experimental paradigms in vivo. Application of QC inhibitors attenuated the migration of monocytes in thioglycollate induced peritonitis.

Thus resveratrol effects might be dependent on its transport into vascular endothelium a question not previously addressed in spite of its obvious and fundamental importance. Via high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry we found that resveratrol was absorbed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a temperature- concentration- and time-dependent manner suggesting the involvement of passive diffusion and active transport. As determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy resveratrol primarily distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Furthermore resveratrol absorption was modulated by serum proteins and sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) yet inhibited by glucose (an SGLT1 substrate) and phlorizin (an SGLT1 selective inhibitor) as well as SGLT1 siRNA transfection. Additionally Sprague-Dawley rats were intragastrically administrated with 100mg/kg of resveratrol and the concentration of resveratrol in blood vessels declined more slowly up to 24h compared to that in the blood.

W.Li L.","Neuropeptide Y: a new mediator linking sympathetic nerves blood vessels and immune system?",2003,"Can J Physiol Pharmacol","Neuropeptide Y (NPY(1-36)) a sympathetic cotransmitter and neurohormone has pleiotropic activities ranging from the control of obesity to anxiolysis and cardiovascular function. Its actions are mediated by multiple Gi/o-coupled receptors (Y1-Y5) and modulated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV/cd26) which inactivates NPY's Y1-agonistic activity but generates the Y2 and Y5-agonist NPY(3-36). Released by sympathetic activity NPY is a major mediator of stress responsible for prolonged vasoconstriction via Y1 receptors. Y1 receptors also mediate NPY's potent vascular growth-promoting activity leading in vivo in rodents to neointima formation. This and the association of a polymorphism of the NPY signal peptide with increased lipidemia and carotid artery thickening in humans strongly suggest NPY's role in atherosclerosis. NPY and DPPIV/cd26 are also coexpressed in the endothelium where the peptide activates angiogenesis. A similar system exists in immune cells where NPY and DPPIV/cd26 are coactivated and involved in the modulation of cytokine release and immune cell functions. Thus NPY both a messenger and a modulator for all three systems is poised to play an important regulatory role facilitating interactions among sympathetic vascular and immune systems in diverse pathophysiological conditions such as hypertension atherosclerosis and stress-related alterations of immunity.","10.1139/y03-006","2","89-94","81","0008-4212 (Print)
