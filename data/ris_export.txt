AB  - ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Motor neuron disease (MND) is an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. There is a pressing need for innovation in identifying therapies to take to clinical trial.
          
          
            Objectives
            
              Here we detail a systematic, structured, and unbiased evidence-based approach to guide selection of drugs for clinical evaluation in the Motor Neuron Disease – Systematic Multi-arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART,
              clinicaltrials.gov
              registration number:
              NCT04302870
              ), an adaptive platform trial.
            
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a two-stage systematic review and meta-analysis to identify potential neuroprotective interventions. In stage one, we identified drugs from the clinical literature tested in at least one study in MND or in two or more cognate diseases with potential shared pivotal pathways (Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or multiple sclerosis). We scored and ranked 66 drugs thus identified using a predefined framework evaluating safety, efficacy, study size and quality of studies. In stage two, we conducted a systematic review of the MND preclinical literature describing efficacy of these drugs in animal models, multicellular eukaryotic models and human induced pluripotent stem cell studies; 17 of these drugs were reported to improve survival in at least one preclinical study. An expert panel then shortlisted and ranked 22 drugs considering stage one and stage two findings, mechanistic plausibility, safety and tolerability, findings from previous clinical trials in MND, and feasibility for use in clinical trials.
          
          
            Results
            Based on this process, the panel selected memantine and trazodone for testing in MND-SMART.
          
          
            Discussion
            For future drug selection, we will incorporate automation tools, text-mining and machine learning techniques to the systematic reviews and consider data generated from other domains, including high-throughput phenotypic screening of human induced pluripotent stem cells.
          
          
            STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
            
              
                We described a systematic, evidence-based approach towards drug repurposing in motor neuron disease (MND), specifically for Motor Neuron Disease – Systematic Multi-arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART), a phase III multi-arm multi-stage clinical trial in MND.
              
              
                Systematic reviews of clinical studies in neurodegenerative diseases and MND preclinical studies provided a robust evidence base to inform expert panel decisions on drug selection for clinical trials.
              
              
                Providing a contemporary evidence base using traditional systematic reviews is challenging given their time-consuming and labour-intensive nature.
              
              
                Incorporation of machine learning and automation tools for systematic reviews, and data from experimental drug screening can be helpful for future drug selection.

AB  - An increase in dementia numbers and global trends in population aging across the world prompts the need for new medications to treat the complex biological dysfunctions, such as neurodegeneration associated with dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Cholinergic signaling, which is important in cognition, is slowly lost in AD, so the first line therapy is to treat symptoms with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to increase levels of acetylcholine. Out of five available FDA-approved AD medications, donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are cholinesterase inhibitors while memantine, a N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, blocks the effects of high glutamate levels. The fifth medication consists of a combination of donepezil and memantine. Although these medications can reduce and temporarily slow down the symptoms of AD, they cannot stop the damage to the brain from progressing. For a superior therapeutic effect, multi-target drugs are required. Thus, a Multi-Target-Directed Ligand (MTDL) strategy has received more attention by scientists who are attempting to develop hybrid molecules that simultaneously modulate multiple biological targets. This review highlights recent examples of the MTDL approach and fragment based strategy in the rational design of new potential AD medications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Journals are an important conduit for the publication of research. However, the reporting quality of research has been shown to be lacking. We sought to determine if reporting quality could be improved by mandating compliance with the relevant reporting guidelines during the submission process to a single surgical journal. METHODS: The policy above was implemented in the International Journal of Surgery (IJS) in March 2013. This involved requiring all authors submitting observational studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews to submit completed STROBE, CONSORT and PRISMA Statement checklists respectively along with their paper, making them available to the editor and peer-reviewers. Articles were analysed in three distinct periods from 2012 to 2014, before and after guideline implementation by two independent teams. RESULTS: Our results show that overall STROBE compliance following implementation of the policy increased by a statistically significant 12% (68%-77%, p = 0.00018). Similarly CONSORT compliance increased (50%-70%) as did PRISMA compliance (48%-76%). The items that improved the most were those providing detail on study design, outcome definitions as well as measurement, how patients and quantitative variables were handled during the analyses and discussing limitations and detailing potential sources of bias. CONCLUSION: Implementing a policy mandating the submission of a completed reporting guideline checklist for observational studies, RCTs and systematic reviews can increase compliance. We advocate this measure for other journals and for other study types.

AB  - Context Even with the increasing use of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) in software engineering (SE), there are still a number of barriers faced by SLR authors. These barriers increase the cost of conducting SLRs. Objective For many of these barriers, appropriate tool support could reduce their impact. In this paper, we use interactions with the SLR community in SE to identify and prioritize a set of requirements for SLR tooling infrastructure. Method This paper analyzes and combines the results from three studies on SLR process barriers and SLR tool requirements to produce a prioritized list of functional requirements for SLR tool support. Using this list of requirements, we perform a feature analysis of the current SLR support tools to identify requirements that are supported as well as identify the need for additional tooling infrastructure. Results The analysis resulted in a list 112 detailed requirements (consolidated into a set of composite requirements) that SE community desires in SLR support tools. The requirements span all the phases of the SLR process. The results show that, while recent tools cover more of the requirements, there are a number of high-priority requirements that are not yet fully covered by any of the existing tools. Conclusion The existing set of SLR tools do not cover all the requirements posed by the community. The list of requirements in this paper is useful for tool developers and researchers wishing to provide support to the SLR community with SE.

AB  - The aim of this study is to systematically collect all published preclinical non‐human animal literature on depression to provide an unbiased overview of existing knowledge. A systematic search will be carried out in PubMed and Embase. Studies will be included if they use non‐human animal experimental model(s) to induce or mimic a depressive‐like phenotype. Data that will be extracted include the model or method of induction; species and gender of the animals used; the behavioural, anatomical, electrophysiological, neurochemical or genetic outcome measure(s) used; risk of bias/quality of reporting; and any intervention(s) tested. There were no exclusion criteria based on language or date of publication. Automation techniques will be used, where appropriate, to reduce the human reviewer time. Meta‐analyses will be conducted if feasible. This broad systematic review aims to gain a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of current approaches, models and outcome measures used. This study aims to provide insights into factors affecting the efficiency of model induction and the efficacy of intervention. Here, we outline the protocol for a systematic review and possible meta‐analysis of the preclinical studies modelling depression‐like behaviours and phenotypes in animals.

AB  - Summary Interventions that have even quite modest effects at the individual level could drastically reduce the future burden of dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease at the population level. In the past three decades, both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions have been studied for the prevention of cognitive decline or dementia in randomised controlled trials of individuals mostly aged older than 50–55 years with or without risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Several trials testing the effects of physical activity, cognitive training, or antihypertensive interventions showed some evidence of efficacy on a primary cognitive endpoint. However, most of these trials had short follow-up periods, and further evidence is needed to confirm effectiveness and establish the optimum design or dose of interventions and ideal target populations. Important innovations in ongoing trials include the development of multidomain interventions, and the use of biomarker or genetic inclusion criteria. Challenges include the use of adaptive trial designs, the development of standardised, sensitive outcome measures, and the need for interventions that can be implemented in resource-poor settings.

AB  - Background: Amyloid beta (Ab) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through different mechanisms including elevations in neuronal calcium. Aducanumab (BIIB037) is a human anti-amyloid antibody that recognizes aggregated forms of Abeta including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. It was previously shown that aducanumab clears amyloid plaques and restores calcium homeostasis in animal models of AD (Kastanenka et al. 2013). The exact mechanism of action for this later effect remains unclear but growing evidence suggests that soluble Abeta oligomers are the toxic species and trigger the perturbation in calciumhomeostasis observed in AD. Therefore we evaluated the ability of aducanumab to target soluble Abeta oligomers present in 3 different preparations and hence to normalize calcium homeostasis in primary neuronal cultures as a functional outcome. Methods: Size of Abeta species present in themedia collected from embryonic Tg2576 neurons in culture (TgCM) synthetic ADDL (Abeta-Derived Diffusible Ligand) preparations or TBS soluble fraction of 22 month old Tg2576 mouse brains was determined by size exclusion chromatography. TgCM ADDLs and brain extracts were immunodepleted with aducanumab and Abeta levels in the supernatants and eluates were determined by ELISA. Calcium imaging in indo-1 loaded neuronal cultures was used before and after application of immunodepleted TgCM ADDLs and Tg2576 mouse brain extracts. Results: TgCM contains primarily low molecular weight species of Abeta. ADDLs and Tg2576 brain extracts contain both low and high molecular weight species of Abeta. Aducanumab binds preferentially to high molecular weight species of Abeta as compared to low molecular weight. ADDL preparations and/or Tg2576 mouse brain extracts immunodepleted with aducanumab did not trigger elevations in calcium (calcium overload) when applied to primary neurons. Conclusions: In addition to recognizing and clearing fibrillar Abeta aggregated in amyloid plaques aducanumab targets high molecular weight soluble Abeta oligomers and restores neuronal function by normalizing calcium homeostasis.

AB  - Preclinical research is a vital step in the drug discovery pipeline and more generally in helping to better understand human disease aetiology and its management. Systematic reviews (SRs) can be powerful in summarising and appraising this evidence concerning a specific research question, to highlight areas of improvements, areas for further research and areas where evidence may be sufficient to take forward to other research domains, for instance clinical trial. Guidance and tools for preclinical research synthesis remain limited despite their clear utility. We aimed to create an online end-to-end platform primarily for conducting SRs of preclinical studies, that was flexible enough to support a wide variety of experimental designs, was adaptable to different research questions, would allow users to adopt emerging automated tools and support them during their review process using best practice. In this article, we introduce the Systematic Review Facility (
              https://syrf.org.uk
              ), which was launched in 2016 and designed to support primarily preclinical SRs from small independent projects to large, crowdsourced projects. We discuss the architecture of the app and its features, including the opportunity to collaborate easily, to efficiently manage projects, to screen and annotate studies for important features (metadata), to extract outcome data into a secure database, and tailor these steps to each project. We introduce how we are working to leverage the use of automation tools and allow the integration of these services to accelerate and automate steps in the systematic review workflow.

AB  - Background: Findings from in vivo research may be less reliable where studies do not report measures to reduce risks of bias. The experimental stroke community has been at the forefront of implementing changes to improve reporting, but it is not known whether these efforts are associated with continuous improvements. Our aims here were firstly to validate an automated tool to assess risks of bias in published works, and secondly to assess the reporting of measures taken to reduce the risk of bias within recent literature for two experimental models of stroke.
            Methods: We developed and used text analytic approaches to automatically ascertain reporting of measures to reduce risk of bias from full-text articles describing animal experiments inducing middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or modelling lacunar stroke.
            Results: Compared with previous assessments, there were improvements in the reporting of measures taken to reduce risks of bias in the MCAO literature but not in the lacunar stroke literature. Accuracy of automated annotation of risk of bias in the MCAO literature was 86% (randomization), 94% (blinding) and 100% (sample size calculation); and in the lacunar stroke literature accuracy was 67% (randomization), 91% (blinding) and 96% (sample size calculation).
            Discussion: There remains substantial opportunity for improvement in the reporting of animal research modelling stroke, particularly in the lacunar stroke literature. Further, automated tools perform sufficiently well to identify whether studies report blinded assessment of outcome, but improvements are required in the tools to ascertain whether randomization and a sample size calculation were reported.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The exponential growth in the world's aged population has increased pressure on drug discovery efforts to identify innovative therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The long and uncertain clinical trial path utilized to test the potential efficacy of these novel agents is challenging. For these and other reasons, there has been an explosion in the generation and availability of transgenic mouse models that mimic some, but not all aspects of AD. The largely overwhelmingly positive results obtained when testing potential clinical agents in these same animal models have failed to translate into similar positive clinical outcomes. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the value and limitations associated with currently available transgenic mouse models of AD. Furthermore, the article proposes ways in which researchers can better characterize pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic endpoints to increase the success rate for novel therapies advancing into clinical development. Lastly, the author discusses ways in which researchers can supplement, expand and improve transgenic mouse models used in AD drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: The use of transgenic mouse models that recapitulate various aspects of AD has expanded our knowledge and understanding of disease pathogenesis immensely. Further success in testing and translating novel therapies from animal models into bona fide medicines would be enhanced by i) the availability of better models that more fully recapitulate the disease spectrum, ii) defining and measuring standardized endpoints that display a pharmacodynamic range, iii) building and including translatable biomarkers and iv) including novel endpoints that would be expected to translate into clinically beneficial outcomes.

AB  - In rodent models of epilepsy, EEG implantation surgery is an essential modality to evaluate electrographic seizures. The inflammatory consequences of EEG electrode-implantation and their resultant effects on seizure susceptibility are unclear. We evaluated electrode-implantation in a two-hit model of epileptogenesis in C57BL/6 mice that included brief, recurrent febrile seizures (FS) at P14 and kainic acid induced seizures (KA-SZ) at P28. During KA-SZ, latencies to first electrographic and behavioral seizures, seizure severity, and KA dose sensitivity were measured. Mice that received subdural screw electrode implants at P25 for EEG monitoring at P28 had significantly shorter latencies to seizures than sham mice, regardless of early life seizure experience. Electrode-implanted mice were sensitive to low dose KA as shown by high mortality rate at KA doses above 10mg/kg. We then directly compared electrode-implantation and KA-SZ in seizure naive CX3CR1GFP/+ transgenic C57BL/6 mice, wherein microglia express green fluorescent protein (GFP), to determine if microglia activation related to surgery was associated with the increased seizure susceptibility in electrode-implanted mice from the two-hit model. Hippocampal microglia activation, as demonstrated by percent area GFP signal and GFP positive cell counts, prior to seizures was indistinguishable between electrode-implanted mice and controls, but was significantly greater in electrode-implanted mice following seizures. Electrode-implantation had a confounding priming effect on the inflammatory response to subsequent seizures.

AB  - Preclinical studies are essential for translation to disease treatments and effective use in clinical practice. An undue emphasis on single approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to have retarded the pace of translation in the field, and there is much frustration in the public about the lack of an effective treatment. We critically reviewed past literature (1990-2014), analyzed numerous data, and discussed key issues at a consensus conference on Brain Ageing and Dementia to identify and overcome roadblocks in studies intended for translation. We highlight various factors that influence the translation of preclinical research and highlight specific preclinical strategies that have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. The field has been hindered by the domination of the amyloid hypothesis in AD pathogenesis while the causative pathways in disease pathology are widely considered to be multifactorial. Understanding the causative events and mechanisms in the pathogenesis are equally important for translation. Greater efforts are necessary to fill in the gaps and overcome a variety of confounds in the generation, study design, testing, and evaluation of animal models and the application to future novel anti-dementia drug trials. A greater variety of potential disease mechanisms must be entertained to enhance progress.

AB  - Background: In this paper we outline a method of applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to aid citation screening in an on-going broad and shallow systematic review, with the aim of achieving a high performing algorithm comparable to human screening. Methods: We tested a range of machine learning algorithms. We applied ML algorithms to incremental numbers of training records and recorded the performance on sensitivity and specificity on an unseen validation set of papers. The performance of these algorithms was assessed on measures of recall, specificity, and accuracy. The classification results of the best performing algorithm was taken forward and applied to the remaining unseen records in the dataset and will be taken forward to the next stage of systematic review. ML was used to identify potential human errors during screening by analysing the training and validation datasets against the machine-ranked score. Results: We found that ML algorithms perform at a desirable level. Classifiers reached 98.7% sensitivity based on learning from a training set of 5749 records, with an inclusion prevalence of 13.2%. The highest level of specificity reached was 86%. Human errors in the training and validation set were successfully identified using ML scores to highlight discrepancies. Training the ML algorithm on the corrected dataset improved the specificity of the algorithm without compromising sensitivity. Error analysis sees a 3% increase or change in sensitivity and specificity, which increases precision and accuracy of the ML algorithm. Conclusions: The technique of using ML to identify human error needs to be investigated in more depth, however this pilot shows a promising approach to integrating human decisions and automation in systematic review methodology.

AB  - Abstract One of the cornerstones of translational research is the use of animal model systems, typically rodents, to inform drug discovery efforts about the potential therapeutic utility of a preclinical compound. A wide variety of pharmacological and genetic models have been developed to incorporate the neurochemical and pathological components of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The complex etiology and heterogeneous pathology of this disease, together with the associated comorbidities such as depression and psychotic-like behavior such as paranoia pose significant challenges for animal model development and for the use of these models to facilitate the development of new drugs. A single model of AD that faithfully reflects both the pathological aspects as well as the behavioral phenotypes is unlikely. However, knowledge of the different models available and a detailed understanding of their features, including specifics of the background strain of a transgenic mouse, the specific mutation, and the progression of both pathological and behavioral changes can aid in selection and characterization of new therapeutics.

AB  - Medical and scientific advances are predicated on new knowledge that is robust and reliable and that serves as a solid foundation on which further advances can be built. In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.

AB  - Systematic reviews (SR) are vital to health care, but have become complicated and time-consuming, due to the rapid expansion of evidence to be synthesised. Fortunately, many tasks of systematic reviews have the potential to be automated or may be assisted by automation. Recent advances in natural language processing, text mining and machine learning have produced new algorithms that can accurately mimic human endeavour in systematic review activity, faster and more cheaply. Automation tools need to be able to work together, to exchange data and results. Therefore, we initiated the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR), to successfully put all the parts of automation of systematic review production together. The first meeting was held in Vienna in October 2015. We established a set of principles to enable tools to be developed and integrated into toolkits.

AB  - Scientists pursue collective knowledge, but they also seek personal recognition from their peers. When scientists decide whether or not to work on a big new problem, they weigh the potential rewards of a major discovery against the costs of setting aside other projects. These self- interested choices can potentially spread researchers across problems in an efficient manner, but efficiency is not guaranteed. We use simple economic models to understand such decisions and their collective consequences. Academic science differs from industrial R&D in that academics often share partial solutions to gain reputation. This convention of Open Science is thought to accelerate collective discovery, but we find that it need not do so. The ability to share partial results influences which scientists work on a particular problem; consequently, Open Science can slow down the solution of a problem if it deters entry by important actors.

AB  - Background The effects of low-frequency conditioning stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses at 1 Hz) of glutamatergic afferents in CA1 hippocampal area using slices from two different strains of adult (3–5 month-old) and aged (23–27 month-old) rats were reinvestigated regarding the discrepancies in the literature concerning the expression of long-term depression (LTD) in the aging brain. Methodology/Principal Findings N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) dependent LTD was examined in both adult (n = 21) and aged (n = 22) Sprague-Dawley rats. While equivalent amounts of LTD could be obtained in both ages, there was significant variability depending upon the time between the slices were made and when they were tested. LTD was not apparent if slices were tested within 3 hours of dissection. The amount of LTD increased over the next three hours but more in adult than in aged rats. This age-related impairment was abolished by exogenous d-serine, thus reflecting the reduced activation of the NMDA-R glycine-binding site by the endogenous agonist in aged rats. Then, the amount of LTD reached asymptote at 5–7 hours following dissection. Similar temporal profiles of LTD expression were seen in young and aged Wistar rats. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results sound a cautionary note regarding the existence of an experimental “window of opportunity” for studying the effects of aging on LTD expression in hippocampal slice preparation.

AB  - Introduction There is evidence that the use of some reporting guidelines, such as the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials, is associated with improved completeness of reporting in health research. However, the current levels of adherence to reporting guidelines are suboptimal. Over the last few years, several actions aiming to improve compliance with reporting guidelines have been taken and proposed. We will conduct a scoping review of interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines in health research that have been evaluated or suggested, in order to inform future interventions.Methods and analysis Our review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methods manual. We will search for relevant studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Moreover, we will carry out lateral searches from the reference lists of the included studies, as well as from the lists of articles citing the included ones. One reviewer will screen the full list, which will be randomly split into two halves and independently screened by the other two reviewers. Two reviewers will perform data extraction independently. Discrepancies will be solved through discussion. In addition, this search strategy will be supplemented by a grey literature search. The interventions found will be classified as assessed or suggested, as well as according to different criteria, in relation to their target (journal policies, journal editors, authors, reviewers, funders, ethical boards or others) or the research stage at which they are performed (design, conducting, reporting or peer review). Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed.Ethics and dissemination A paper summarising the findings from this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This scoping review will contribute to a better understanding and a broader perspective on how the problem of adhering better to reporting guidelines has been tackled so far. This could be a major first step towards developing future strategies to improve compliance with reporting guidelines in health research.

AB  - Objectives To summarise logistical aspects of recently completed systematic reviews that were registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) registry to quantify the time and resources required to complete such projects.Design Meta-analysis.Data sources and study selection All of the 195 registered and completed reviews (status from the PROSPERO registry) with associated publications at the time of our search (1 July 2014).Data extraction All authors extracted data using registry entries and publication information related to the data sources used, the number of initially retrieved citations, the final number of included studies, the time between registration date to publication date and number of authors involved for completion of each publication. Information related to funding and geographical location was also recorded when reported.Results The mean estimated time to complete the project and publish the review was 67.3 weeks (IQR=42). The number of studies found in the literature searches ranged from 27 to 92 020; the mean yield rate of included studies was 2.94% (IQR=2.5); and the mean number of authors per review was 5, SD=3. Funded reviews took significantly longer to complete and publish (mean=42 vs 26 weeks) and involved more authors and team members (mean=6.8 vs 4.8 people) than those that did not report funding (both p<0.001).Conclusions Systematic reviews presently take much time and require large amounts of human resources. In the light of the ever-increasing volume of published studies, application of existing computing and informatics technology should be applied to decrease this time and resource burden. We discuss recently published guidelines that provide a framework to make finding and accessing relevant literature less burdensome.

AB  - Many studies (in information science) have looked at the growth of science. In this study, we reexamine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (a) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (b) analyze the data across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical technique?segmented regression analysis?which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (a) the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (b) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars, and 8 to 9% to 2010.

AB  - 1. Abstract 1.1 Background Working dogs are selected based on predictions from tests that they will be able to perform specific tasks in often challenging environments. However, withdrawal from service in working dogs is still a big problem, bringing into question the reliability of the selection tests used to make these predictions. 1.2 Methods A systematic review was undertaken aimed at bringing together available information on the reliability and predictive validity of the assessment of behavioural characteristics used with working dogs to establish the quality of selection tests currently available for use to predict success in working dogs. 1.3 Results The search procedures resulted in 16 papers meeting the criteria for inclusion. A large range of behaviour tests and parameters were used in the identified papers, and so behaviour tests and their underpinning constructs were grouped on the basis of their relationship with positive core affect (willingness to work, human-directed social behaviour, object-directed play tendencies) and negative core affect (human-directed aggression, approach withdrawal tendencies, sensitivity to aversives). We then examined the papers for reports of inter-rater reliability, within-session intra-rater reliability, test-retest validity and predictive validity. 1.4 Conclusions The review revealed a widespread lack of information relating to the reliability and validity of measures to assess behaviour and inconsistencies in terminologies, study parameters and indices of success. There is a need to standardise the reporting of these aspects of behavioural tests in order to improve the knowledge base of what characteristics are predictive of optimal performance in working dog roles, improving selection processes and reducing working dog redundancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) species and deposition of senile plaques (SPs). Clinical trials with the anti-Aβ antibody aducanumab have been completed recently. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the proteomic profile of SPs and surrounding tissue in a mouse model of AD in 10-month-old tgAPPPS1-21 mice after chronic treatment with aducanumab for four months with weekly dosing (10 mg/kg). METHODS: After observing significant reduction of SP numbers in hippocampi of aducanumab-treated mice we applied a localized proteomic analysis by combining laser microdissection and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the remaining SPs in hippocampi. We microdissected three subregions containing SPs SP penumbra level 1 and an additional penumbra level 2 to follow the proteomic profile as gradient. RESULTS: In the aducanumab-treated mice we identified 17 significantly regulated proteins that were associated with 1) mitochondria and metabolism (ACAT2 ATP5J ETFA EXOG HK1 NDUFA4 NDUFS7 PLCB1 PPP2R4) 2) cytoskeleton and axons (ADD1 CAPZB DPYSL3 MAG) 3) stress response (HIST1H1C/HIST1H1D HSPA12A) and 4) AβPP trafficking/processing (CD81 GDI2). These pathways and some of the identified proteins are implicated in AD pathogenesis. Proteins associated with mitochondria and metabolism were mainly upregulated while proteins associated with AβPP trafficking/processing and stress response pathways were mainly downregulated suggesting that aducanumab could lead to a beneficial proteomic profile around SPs in tgAPPPS1-21 mice. CONCLUSION: We identified novel proteomic patterns of SPs and surrounding tissue indicating that chronic treatment with aducanumab could inhibit Aβ toxicity and increase phagocytosis and cell viability.

AB  - Science is supposed to be cumulative, but scientists only rarely cumulate evidence scientifically. This means that users of research evidence have to cope with a plethora of reports of individual studies with no systematic attempt made to present new results in the context of similar studies. Although the need to synthesize research evidence has been recognized for well over two centuries, explicit methods for this form of research were not developed until the 20th century. The development of methods to reduce statistical imprecision using quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) preceded the development of methods to reduce biases, the latter only beginning to receive proper attention during the last quarter of the 20th century. In this article, the authors identify some of the trends and highlights in this history, to which researchers in the physical, natural, and social sciences have all contributed, and speculate briefly about the ?future history? of research synthesis.

AB  - Purpose of this letter was to explore the trends regarding methodological flaws of systematic review and meta-analyses (SRMAs) based on retraction notes in the past decades, and the categories of reasons for the retractions. Content analysis with descriptive statistics, Cochran Q test, and multinomial logistic regression were used. Based on 187 records of retracted SRMAs, retraction announcements can be categorized into academic ethical violation, methodological flaw, and writing or reporting problem. The numbers of academic ethical violation were significantly higher than those with methodological flaw (z = 3.51; p < 0.01) or writing problem (z = 8.58; p < 0.001). The numbers of methodological flaw were also higher than that with writing problem (z = 6.47; p < 0.001). Moreover, an increased proportion of methodological flaw was observed since 2006, and the retraction year was significantly associated with increased proportion of methodological flaw when academic ethical violation as the reference group.

AB  - PROGRESSIVE cerebral deposition of the 39–43-amino-acid amy-loid β-protein (Aβ) is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease which precedes symptoms of dementia by years or decades. The only specific molecular defects that cause Alzheimer's disease which have been identified so far are missense mutations in the gene encoding the β-amyloid precursor protein (β3-APP) in certain families with an autosomal dominant form of the disease (familial Alzheimer's disease, or FAD)1–5. These mutations are located within or immediately flanking the Aβ region of β-APP, but the mechanism by which they cause the pathological phenotype of early and accelerated Aβ deposition is unknown. Here we report that cultured cells which express a β-APP complementary DNA bearing a double mutation (Lys to Asn at residue 595 plus Met to Leu at position 596) found in a Swedish FAD family5 produce ∼6–8-fold more Aβ than cells expressing normal β-APP. The Met 596 to Leu mutation is principally responsible for the increase. These data establish a direct link between a FAD genotype and the clinicopathological phenotype. Further, they confirm the relev-ance of the continuous Aβ production by cultured cells6–8 for elucidating the fundamental mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic mechanism underlying learning and memory that has been studied extensively in laboratory animals. The study of LTP recently has been extended into humans with repetitive sensory stimulation to induce cortical LTP. In this review article, we will discuss past results from our group demonstrating that repetitive sensory stimulation (visual or auditory) induces LTP within the sensory cortex (visual/auditory, respectively) and can be measured noninvasively with electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will discuss a number of studies that indicate that this form of LTP shares several characteristics with the synaptic LTP described in animals: it is frequency dependent, long-lasting (> 1 hour), input-specific, depotentiates with low-frequency stimulation, and is blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockers in rats. In this review, we also present new data with regard to the behavioral significance of human sensory LTP. These advances will permit enquiry into the functional significance of LTP that has been hindered by the absence of a human model. The ability to elicit LTP with a natural sensory stimulus noninvasively will provide a model system allowing the detailed examination of synaptic plasticity in normal subjects and might have future clinical applications in the diagnosis and assessment of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders.

AB  - Publisher Summary Rats mainly rely on auditory, olfactory, and tactile information for orientation with visual information being used when available. Their behavior is only partially inherited and to some extent can be modified by learning and thus is adapted to different environmental conditions. This makes the rat a good model for studying the basic principles of behavior. Depending on the information looked for, different techniques are used for the evaluation of behavior. When looking for the health status of an animal or for pharmacological effects induced by a chemical, clinically relevant changes in spontaneous behavior are rated. Analyzing behavioral components of spontaneous behavior by counting the frequency or measuring the duration of specific behaviors provides information on the animal's needs or interests. Such an ethological approach is used, e.g. to analyze social behavior of grouphoused animals, but can also be used to control instrumental behavior for the validity of the parameters measured or simply as endpoints in an instrumental test. Instrumental techniques are used to modify spontaneous behavior or its frequency in order to gain information on some underlying mechanisms of mood, learning or memory, or to measure specific sensorimotor functions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of an additional review based on reporting guidelines such as STROBE and CONSORT on quality of manuscripts. DESIGN: Masked randomised trial. Population Original research manuscripts submitted to the Medicina Clinica journal from May 2008 to April 2009 and considered suitable for publication. INTERVENTION: CONTROL GROUP: conventional peer reviews alone. Intervention group: conventional review plus an additional review looking for missing items from reporting guidelines. Outcomes Manuscript quality, assessed with a 5 point Likert scale (primary: overall quality; secondary: average quality of specific items in paper). Main analysis compared groups as allocated, after adjustment for baseline factors (analysis of covariance); sensitivity analysis compared groups as reviewed. Adherence to reviewer suggestions assessed with Likert scale. RESULTS: Of 126 consecutive papers receiving conventional review, 34 were not suitable for publication. The remaining 92 papers were allocated to receive conventional reviews alone (n=41) or additional reviews (n=51). Four papers assigned to the conventional review group deviated from protocol; they received an additional review based on reporting guidelines. We saw an improvement in manuscript quality in favour of the additional review group (comparison as allocated, 0.25, 95% confidence interval -0.05 to 0.54; as reviewed, 0.33, 0.03 to 0.63). More papers with additional reviews than with conventional reviews alone improved from baseline (22 (43%) v eight (20%), difference 23.6% (3.2% to 44.0%), number needed to treat 4.2 (from 2.3 to 31.2), relative risk 2.21 (1.10 to 4.44)). Authors in the additional review group adhered more to suggestions from conventional reviews than to those from additional reviews (average increase 0.43 Likert points (0.19 to 0.67)). CONCLUSIONS: Additional reviews based on reporting guidelines improve manuscript quality, although the observed effect was smaller than hypothesised and not definitively demonstrated. Authors adhere more to suggestions from conventional reviews than to those from additional reviews, showing difficulties in adhering to high methodological standards at the latest research phases. To boost paper quality and impact, authors should be aware of future requirements of reporting guidelines at the very beginning of their study. Trial registration and protocol Although registries do not include trials of peer review, the protocol design was submitted to sponsored research projects (Instituto de Salud Carlos III, PI081903).

AB  - Three groups of undergraduate volunteers were given differential expectancies about S's behavior prior to their observations of planaria undergoing conditioning. Group HE (n = 5) received a high response expectancy, Group LE (n = 5) a low response expectancy, and Group HLE observed one planarian under each expectancy condition. Group HE reported 18% contractions and 49% head turns in 100 trials whereas Group LE reported but 9% and 9.9%. Group HLE reported 15.4% contractions and 30% head turns under high expectancy instructions, but only 4.8% and 15.4% under low expectancy instructions. Analyses of the effect of instructions between Groups HE and LE and within Group HLE both yielded significant F ratios (P < .001). Although it is unwise to generalize from naive volunteers to sophisticated investigators, it is clear that response recording in planaria should be made less ambiguous, perhaps by taking photographic records.

AB  - The growing interest in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) led investigators to identify modifiable risk and predictive factors useful to design early intervention strategies. The preclinical stage of AD is characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation into amyloid plaques and tau phosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles. There is a consensus on the importance of sleep within this context: the bidirectional relationship between sleep and AD pathology is supported by growing evidence that proved that the occurrence of sleep changes starting from the preclinical stage of AD, many years before the onset of cognitive decline. Hence, we review the most recent studies on sleep disturbances related to Abeta and the effects of sleep deprivation on Abeta accumulation in animal and human models. We also discuss evidence on the role of sleep in clearing the brain of toxic metabolic by-products, with original findings of the clearance activity of the glymphatic system stimulated by sleep. Furthermore, starting from new recent advances about the relationship between slow-wave sleep (SWS) and Abeta burden, we review the results of recent electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in order to clarify the possible role of SWS component disruption as a novel mechanistic pathway through which Abeta pathology may contribute to cognitive decline and, conversely, the eventual useful role of SWS in facilitating Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss some promising innovative, effective, low-risk, non-invasive interventions, although empirical evidence on the efficacy of sleep interventions in improving the course of AD is at the very beginning.

AB  - Strains of mice that show characteristic patterns of behavior are critical for research in neurobehavioral genetics. Possible confounding influences of the laboratory environment were studied in several inbred strains and one null mutant by simultaneous testing in three laboratories on a battery of six behaviors. Apparatus, test protocols, and many environmental variables were rigorously equated. Strains differed markedly in all behaviors, and despite standardization, there were systematic differences in behavior across labs. For some tests, the magnitude of genetic differences depended upon the specific testing lab. Thus, experiments characterizing mutants may yield results that are idiosyncratic to a particular laboratory.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity alters the strength of information flow between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons and thus modifies the likelihood that action potentials in a presynaptic neuron will lead to an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. As such, synaptic plasticity and pathological changes in synaptic plasticity impact the synaptic computation which controls the information flow through the neural microcircuits responsible for the complex information processing necessary to drive adaptive behaviors. As current theories of neuropsychiatric disease suggest that distinct dysfunctions in neural circuit performance may critically underlie the unique symptoms of these diseases, pathological alterations in synaptic plasticity mechanisms may be fundamental to the disease process. Here we consider mechanisms of both short-term and long-term plasticity of synaptic transmission and their possible roles in information processing by neural microcircuits in both health and disease. As paradigms of neuropsychiatric diseases with strongly implicated risk genes, we discuss the findings in schizophrenia and autism and consider the alterations in synaptic plasticity and network function observed in both human studies and genetic mouse models of these diseases. Together these studies have begun to point towards a likely dominant role of short-term synaptic plasticity alterations in schizophrenia while dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders may be due to a combination of both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity alterations.

AB  - This Mini Review discusses the merits and shortfalls of transgenic (tg) rodents modeling aspects of the human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and their application to evaluate experimental therapeutics. It addresses some of the differences between mouse and rat tg models for these investigations. It relates, in a condensed fashion, the experience of our research laboratory with the application of anti-inflammatory compounds and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) at the earliest stages of AD-like amyloid pathology in tg mice. The application of SAM was intended to revert the global brain DNA hypomethylation unleashed by the intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-β-immunoreactive material, an intervention that restored levels of DNA methylation including of the bace1 gene. This review also summarizes experimental pharmacology observations made in the McGill tg rat model of AD-like pathology by applying “nano-lithium” or a drug with allosteric M1 muscarinic and sigma 1 receptor agonistic properties (AF710B). Extremely low doses of lithium (up to 400 times lower than used in the clinic) had remarkable beneficial effects on lowering pathology and improving cognitive functions in tg rats. Likewise, AF710B treatment, even at advanced stages of the pathology, displayed remarkable beneficial effects. This drug, in experimental conditions, demonstrated possible “disease-modifying” properties as pathology was frankly diminished and cognition improved after a month of “wash-out” period. The Mini-Review ends with a discussion on the predictive value of similar experimental pharmacological interventions in current rodent tg models. It comments on the validity of some of these approaches for early interventions at preclinical stages of AD, interventions which may be envisioned once definitive diagnosis of AD before clinical presentation is made possible.

AB  - This Mini Review discusses the merits and shortfalls of transgenic (tg) rodents modeling aspects of the human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and their application to evaluate experimental therapeutics. It addresses some of the differences between mouse and rat tg models for these investigations. It relates, in a condensed fashion, the experience of our research laboratory with the application of anti-inflammatory compounds and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) at the earliest stages of AD-like amyloid pathology in tg mice. The application of SAM was intended to revert the global brain DNA hypomethylation unleashed by the intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-β-immunoreactive material, an intervention that restored levels of DNA methylation including of the bace1 gene. This review also summarizes experimental pharmacology observations made in the McGill tg rat model of AD-like pathology by applying “nano-lithium” or a drug with allosteric M1 muscarinic and sigma 1 receptor agonistic properties (AF710B). Extremely low doses of lithium (up to 400 times lower than used in the clinic) had remarkable beneficial effects on lowering pathology and improving cognitive functions in tg rats. Likewise, AF710B treatment, even at advanced stages of the pathology, displayed remarkable beneficial effects. This drug, in experimental conditions, demonstrated possible “disease-modifying” properties as pathology was frankly diminished and cognition improved after a month of “wash-out” period. The Mini-Review ends with a discussion on the predictive value of similar experimental pharmacological interventions in current rodent tg models. It comments on the validity of some of these approaches for early interventions at preclinical stages of AD, interventions which may be envisioned once definitive diagnosis of AD before clinical presentation is made possible.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing in frequency as the global population ages. Five drugs are approved for treatment of AD, including four cholinesterase inhibitors and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist. We have an urgent need to find new therapies for AD. METHODS: We examined Clinicaltrials.gov, a public website that records ongoing clinical trials. We examined the decade of 2002 to 2012, to better understand AD-drug development. We reviewed trials by sponsor, sites, drug mechanism of action, duration, number of patients required, and rate of success in terms of advancement from one phase to the next. We also reviewed the current AD therapy pipeline. RESULTS: During the 2002 to 2012 observation period, 413 AD trials were performed: 124 Phase 1 trials, 206 Phase 2 trials, and 83 Phase 3 trials. Seventy-eight percent were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. The United States of America (U.S.) remains the single world region with the greatest number of trials; cumulatively, more non-U.S. than U.S. trials are performed. The largest number of registered trials addressed symptomatic agents aimed at improving cognition (36.6%), followed by trials of disease-modifying small molecules (35.1%) and trials of disease-modifying immunotherapies (18%). The mean length of trials increases from Phase 2 to Phase 3, and the number of participants in trials increases between Phase 2 and Phase 3. Trials of disease-modifying agents are larger and longer than those for symptomatic agents. A very high attrition rate was found, with an overall success rate during the 2002 to 2012 period of 0.4% (99.6% failure). CONCLUSIONS: The Clinicaltrials.gov database demonstrates that relatively few clinical trials are undertaken for AD therapeutics, considering the magnitude of the problem. The success rate for advancing from one phase to another is low, and the number of compounds progressing to regulatory review is among the lowest found in any therapeutic area. The AD drug-development ecosystem requires support.

AB  - Background and aims: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can be a severely disabling side-effect of commonly used cancer chemotherapeutics, requiring cessation or dose reduction, impacting on survival and quality of life. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of research using animal models of CIPN to inform robust experimental design. Methods: We systematically searched 5 online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Citation Index, Biosis Previews and Embase (September 2012) to identify publications reporting in vivo CIPN modelling. Due to the number of publications and high accrual rate of new studies, we ran an updated search November 2015, using machine-learning and text mining to identify relevant studies. All data were abstracted by two independent reviewers. For each comparison we calculated a standardised mean difference effect size then combined effects in a random effects meta-analysis. The impact of study design factors and reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias was assessed. We ran power analysis for the most commonly reported behavioural tests. Results: 341 publications were included. The majority (84%) of studies reported using male animals to model CIPN; the most commonly reported strain was Sprague Dawley rat. In modelling experiments, Vincristine was associated with the greatest increase in pain-related behaviour (-3.22 SD [-3.88; -2.56], n=152, p=0). The most commonly reported outcome measure was evoked limb withdrawal to mechanical monofilaments. Pain-related complex behaviours were rarely reported. The number of animals required to obtain 80% power with a significance level of 0.05 varied substantially across behavioural tests. Overall, studies were at moderate risk of bias, with modest reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias. Conclusions: Here we provide a comprehensive summary of the field of animal models of CIPN and inform robust experimental design by highlighting measures to increase the internal and external validity of studies using animal models of CIPN. Power calculations and other factors, such as clinical relevance, should inform the choice of outcome measure in study design.

AB  - The Morris water maze (MWM) was described 20 years ago as a device to investigate spatial learning and memory in laboratory rats. In the meanwhile, it has become one of the most frequently used laboratory tools in behavioral neuroscience. Many methodological variations of the MWM task have been and are being used by research groups in many different applications. However, researchers have become increasingly aware that MWM performance is influenced by factors such as apparatus or training procedure as well as by the characteristics of the experimental animals (sex, species/strain, age, nutritional state, exposure to stress or infection). Lesions in distinct brain regions like hippocampus, striatum, basal forebrain, cerebellum and cerebral cortex were shown to impair MWM performance, but disconnecting rather than destroying brain regions relevant for spatial learning may impair MWM performance as well. Spatial learning in general and MWM performance in particular appear to depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems constituting a functionally integrated neural network. Finally, the MWM task has often been used in the validation of rodent models for neurocognitive disorders and the evaluation of possible neurocognitive treatments. Through its many applications, MWM testing gained a position at the very core of contemporary neuroscience research.

AB  - Animal models of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases have enhanced the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Nevertheless, our understanding of these disorders and the development of mechanistically designed therapeutics can still benefit from more rigorous use of the models and from generation of animals that more faithfully recapitulate human disease. Here we review the current state of rodent models for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We discuss the limitations and utility of current models, issues regarding translatability, and future directions for developing animal models of these human disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. At the diagnostic stage, the AD brain is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss. Despite the large variety of therapeutic approaches, this condition remains incurable, since at the time of clinical diagnosis, the brain has already suffered irreversible and extensive damage. In recent years, it has become evident that AD starts decades prior to its clinical presentation. In this regard, transgenic animal models can shed much light on the mechanisms underlying this “pre-clinical” stage, enabling the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets. This paper summarizes the formidable efforts to create models mimicking the various aspects of AD pathology in the rat. Transgenic rat models offer distinctive advantages over mice. Rats are physiologically, genetically and morphologically closer to humans. More importantly, the rat has a well-characterized, rich behavioral display. Consequently, rat models of AD should allow a more sophisticated and accurate assessment of the impact of pathology and novel therapeutics on cognitive outcomes.

AB  - Current research on the effects of pharmacological agents on human neurophysiology finds its roots in animal research, which is also reflected in contemporary animal pharmaco-electroencephalography (p-EEG) applications. The contributions, present value and translational appreciation of animal p-EEG-based applications are strongly interlinked with progress in recording and neuroscience analysis methodology. After the pioneering years in the late 19th and early 20th century, animal p-EEG research flourished in the pharmaceutical industry in the early 1980s. However, around the turn of the millennium the emergence of structurally and functionally revealing imaging techniques and the increasing application of molecular biology caused a temporary reduction in the use of EEG as a window into the brain for the prediction of drug efficacy. Today, animal p-EEG is applied again for its biomarker potential - extensive databases of p-EEG and polysomnography studies in rats and mice hold EEG signatures of a broad collection of psychoactive reference and test compounds. A multitude of functional EEG measures has been investigated, ranging from simple spectral power and sleep-wake parameters to advanced neuronal connectivity and plasticity parameters. Compared to clinical p-EEG studies, where the level of vigilance can be well controlled, changes in sleep-waking behaviour are generally a prominent confounding variable in animal p-EEG studies and need to be dealt with. Contributions of rodent pharmaco-sleep EEG research are outlined to illustrate the value and limitations of such preclinical p-EEG data for pharmacodynamic and chronopharmacological drug profiling. Contemporary applications of p-EEG and pharmaco-sleep EEG recordings in animals provide a common and relatively inexpensive window into the functional brain early in the preclinical and clinical development of psychoactive drugs in comparison to other brain imaging techniques. They provide information on the impact of drugs on arousal and sleep architecture, assessing their neuropharmacological characteristics in vivo, including central exposure and information on kinetics. In view of the clear disadvantages as well as advantages of animal p-EEG as compared to clinical p-EEG, general statements about the usefulness of EEG as a biomarker to demonstrate the translatability of p-EEG effects should be made with caution, however, because they depend on the particular EEG or sleep parameter that is being studied. The contribution of animal p-EEG studies to the translational characterisation of centrally active drugs can be furthered by adherence to guidelines for methodological standardisation, which are presently under construction by the International Pharmaco-EEG Society (IPEG).

AB  - Experimental models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are critical to gaining a better understanding of pathogenesis and to assess the potential of novel therapeutic approaches. The most commonly used experimental animal models are transgenic mice that overexpress human genes associated with familial AD (FAD) that result in the formation of amyloid plaques. However, AD is defined by the presence and interplay of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. The track record of success in AD clinical trials thus far has been very poor. In part, this high failure rate has been related to the premature translation of highly successful results in animal models that mirror only limited aspects of AD pathology to humans. A greater understanding of the strengths and weakness of each of the various models and the use of more than one model to evaluate potential therapies would help enhance the success of therapy translation from preclinical studies to patients. In this review, we summarize the pathological features and limitations of the major experimental models of AD, including transgenic mice, transgenic rats, various physiological models of sporadic AD and in vitro human cell culture models.

AB  - Experimental models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are critical to gaining a better understanding of pathogenesis and to assess the potential of novel therapeutic approaches. The most commonly used experimental animal models are transgenic mice that overexpress human genes associated with familial AD (FAD) that result in the formation of amyloid plaques. However, AD is defined by the presence and interplay of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. The track record of success in AD clinical trials thus far has been very poor. In part, this high failure rate has been related to the premature translation of highly successful results in animal models that mirror only limited aspects of AD pathology to humans. A greater understanding of the strengths and weakness of each of the various models and the use of more than one model to evaluate potential therapies would help enhance the success of therapy translation from preclinical studies to patients.

AB  - Physiological and pathological ageing (as exemplified by Alzheimer's disease AD) are characterized by a progressive decline that also includes cognition. How this decline can be slowed or even reversed is a critical question. Here we discuss therapeutic ultrasound as a novel modality to achieve this goal. In our studies we explored three fundamental strategies (i) scanning ultrasound on its own (SUS(only)) (ii) therapeutic ultrasound in concert with intravenously injected microbubbles (which transiently opens the blood-brain barrier SUS(+MB)) and (iii) SUS(+MB) in combination with therapeutic antibodies (SUS(+MB+mAb)). These studies show SUS(+MB) effectively clears amyloid and restores memory in amyloid-depositing mice and partially clears Tau and ameliorates memory impairments in Tau transgenic mice with additional improvements found in combination trials (SUS(+MB+mAb)). Interestingly both SUS(only) and SUS(+MB) restored the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP electrophysiological correlate of memory) in senescent wild-type mice. Both lead to increased neurogenesis and SUS(only) in particular resulted in improved spatial memory. We discuss these findings side-by-side with our findings obtained in AD mouse models. We conclude that therapeutic ultrasound is a non-invasive pleiotropic modality that may present a treatment option not only for AD but also for enhancing cognition in physiological ageing.

AB  - Abstract The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a considerable socio-economic challenge. Decades of experimental research have not led to the development of effective disease modifying interventions. A deeper understanding of in vivo research might provide insights to inform future in vivo research and clinical trial design. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions tested in transgenic mouse models of AD. We searched electronically for publications testing interventions in transgenic models of AD. We extracted data for outcome, study characteristics and reported study quality and calculated summary estimates of efficacy using random effects meta-analysis. We identified 427 publications describing 357 interventions in 55 transgenic models, involving 11,118 animals in 838 experiments. Of concern, reported study quality was relatively low; fewer than one in four publications reported the blinded assessment of outcome or random allocation to group and no study reported a sample size calculation. Additionally, there were few data for any individual intervention—only 16 interventions had outcomes described in 5 or more publications. Finally, “trim and fill” analyses suggested one in seven pathological and neurobehavioural experiments remain unpublished. Given these historical weaknesses in the in vivo modelling of AD in transgenic animals and the identified risks of bias, clinical trials that are based on claims of efficacy in animals should only proceed after a detailed critical appraisal of those animal data.

AB  - Despite many efforts by the research community, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still an incurable neurodegenerative condition that affects an estimated 44 million individuals worldwide and this figure is expected to increase to 135 million by the year 2050. As the research community currently reflects on previous endeavours, it is essential that we maximize the use of existing knowledge to inform future trials in the field. This article describes the development of a systematically identified data set relating to over 300 interventions tested in over 10,000 animals. The data set includes cohort-level information for six structural outcomes and six behavioural assessments. We encourage others to use this dataset to inform the design of future animal experiments modelling AD and to promote effective translation to human health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNF-alphaI) on Alzheimer's disease-associated pathology. DESIGN: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases for human and animal studies that evaluated the use of TNF-alphaI was performed on 26 October 2016. RESULTS: The main outcomes assessed were cognition and behaviour, reduction in brain tissue mass, presence of plaques and tangles, and synaptic function. Risk of bias was assessed regarding blinding, statistical model, outcome reporting, and other biases. Sixteen studies were included, 13 of which were animal studies and 3 of which were human. All animal studies found that treatment with TNF-alphaI leads to an improvement in cognition and behaviour. None of the studies measured change in brain tissue mass. The majority of studies documented a beneficial effect in other areas, including the presence of plaques and tangles and synaptic function. The amount of data from human studies was limited. Two out of 3 studies concluded that TNF-alphaI are beneficial in Alzheimer's disease patients, with one being an observational study and the latter being a small pilot study, with a high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that a large-scale randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of TNF-alphaI on humans is warranted.

AB  - Statement of Purpose Innovation or Hypothesis: Clinical trials for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have had a high failure rate (99.6%) (Cummings et al. 2014). The reasons may include insufficient disease understanding lack of targeting to the right stage of disease or patient population and insufficient drug exposure in the brain. To maximize the learning from past clinical experience we established a single mechanistic mathematical model of mild/moderate AD describing molecular mechanisms leading to plaque formation with the help of clinical biomarkers and capture the effects of multiple anti-amyloid beta (A) monoclonal antibodies and secretase (BACE) inhibitors. Description of Methods and Materials: The AD model includes three different pools of A species: monomer soluble oligomer and plaque and describes A production aggregation and the intercompartment transport as well as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of the plaque. The model was informed by data from stable isotope labeling kinetics experiments molecular binding and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and biomarker data for four anti-A monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab crenezumab solanezumab bapineuzumab) and two small molecule BACE inhibitors (elenbecestat verubecestat). Data and Results: The model was calibrated to capture plasma and cerebrospinal fluid drug PK A levels and plaque burden change from published clinical studies. Because of the complexity of A species binding affinities of antibodies to these species can be difficult to measure and often a wide range of values is reported for the same antibody. By fitting the model to all available A data in different compartments we were able to estimate apparent in vivo affinities to different A species for the four anti-A antibodies. Our analyses indicate that for drugs that showed no or minimal plaque reduction in clinical studies doses that are higher than those tested could lead to plaque reduction. Drugs that induce antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis can lead to significant plaque reduction at lower doses and with faster kinetics than drugs that do not include this mechanism. Interpretation Conclusion or Significance: We have developed a mechanistic mathematical model to analyze treatment effects of anti-A antibodies and BACE inhibitors on soluble A species and plaque. The results allow us to compare the effects of various drugs mechanisms and combinations on plaque burden. In the future the model could be expanded to capture drug effects at different stages of disease.

AB  - Background: Failed clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that Abeta aggregation must be targeted at very early disease stages to be effective. Furthermore the deposition of amyloid per se as assessed microscopically or via PET imaging is likely to be a relatively late manifestation of the pathogenic process. It is not known when the initial pre-amyloid Abeta seeds begin to form propagate and spread through the brain nor has the structure of the initial Abeta seeds been defined. Method(s): We tested a variety of well-described and clinically-tested antibodies for their in vivo recognition of pre-amyloid seeds in Abeta-precursor protein(APP)-transgenic mice. In parallel we used immunoprecipitation of size-fractionated native brain-derived Abeta assemblies and established antibody recognition profiles to allow prediction of Abeta seed recognition. Result(s): We identified at least one antibody (the murine version of aducanumab) that administered for only 5 consecutive days at pre-deposition stage achieved long-lasting (50%) prevention of Abeta deposition and associated pathologies in APP-transgenic mice 6 months later. Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate the presence of pathogenic Abeta seeds well before amyloid formation becomes detectable. Lowering such bioactive pre-amyloid seeds maybe an effective paradigm for AD prevention.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Efforts to improve the reproducibility and integrity of science are typically justified by a narrative of crisis, according to which most published results are unreliable due to growing problems with research and publication practices. This article provides an overview of recent evidence suggesting that this narrative is mistaken, and argues that a narrative of epochal changes and empowerment of scientists would be more accurate, inspiring, and compelling.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by wide heterogeneity in cognitive and behavioural syndromes, risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Addressing this phenotypic variation will be crucial for the development of precise and effective therapeutics in AD. Sex-related differences in neural anatomy and function are starting to emerge, and sex might constitute an important factor for AD patient stratification and personalized treatment. Although the effects of sex on AD epidemiology are currently the subject of intense investigation, the notion of sex-specific clinicopathological AD phenotypes is largely unexplored. In this Review, we critically discuss the evidence for sex-related differences in AD symptomatology, progression, biomarkers, risk factor profiles and treatment. The cumulative evidence reviewed indicates sex-specific patterns of disease manifestation as well as sex differences in the rates of cognitive decline and brain atrophy, suggesting that sex is a crucial variable in disease heterogeneity. We discuss critical challenges and knowledge gaps in our current understanding. Elucidating sex differences in disease phenotypes will be instrumental in the development of a ‘precision medicine’ approach in AD, encompassing individual, multimodal, biomarker-driven and sex-sensitive strategies for prevention, detection, drug development and treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD. Overall, more insight into these questions should enable researchers in this field to develop novel therapeutic targets to mitigate or delay the cognitive deficits associated with this devastating disease.

AB  - Experiments that produce null results face a higher barrier to publication than those that yield statistically significant differences. Whether this is a problem depends on how many null but otherwise valid results might be trapped in the file drawer. Franco et al. use a Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences archive of nearly 250 peer-reviewed proposals of social science experiments conducted on nationally representative samples. They find that only 10 out of 48 null results were published, whereas 56 out of 91 studies with strongly significant results made it into a journal.Science, this issue p. 1502 We studied publication bias in the social sciences by analyzing a known population of conducted studies—221 in total—in which there is a full accounting of what is published and unpublished. We leveraged Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences (TESS), a National Science Foundation–sponsored program in which researchers propose survey-based experiments to be run on representative samples of American adults. Because TESS proposals undergo rigorous peer review, the studies in the sample all exceed a substantial quality threshold. Strong results are 40 percentage points more likely to be published than are null results and 60 percentage points more likely to be written up. We provide direct evidence of publication bias and identify the stage of research production at which publication bias occurs: Authors do not write up and submit null findings.

AB  - Peering into the field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the outsider realizes that many of the therapeutic strategies tested (in animal models) have been successful. One also may notice that there is a deficit in translational research, i.e., to take a successful drug in mice and translate it to the patient. Efforts are still focused on novel projects to expand the therapeutic arsenal to “cure mice.” Scientific reasons behind so many successful strategies are not obvious. This article aims to review the current approaches to combat AD and to open a debate on common mechanisms of cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. In short, either the rodent models are not good and should be discontinued, or we should extract the most useful information from those models. An example of a question that may be debated for the advancement in AD therapy is: In addition to reducing amyloid and tau pathologies, would it be necessary to boost synaptic strength and cognition? The debate could provide clues to turn around the current negative output in generating effective drugs for patients. Furthermore, discovery of biomarkers in human body fluids, and a clear distinction between cognitive enhancers and disease modifying strategies, should be instrumental for advancing in anti-AD drug discovery.

AB  - In a most simplified way we can say that much of the symptomatology that characterizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be attributed to a cascade of toxic events initiated by the presence in the interstitial space of the brain of oligomers of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) peptide a cleavage by-product of the Amyloid precursor protein (APP). Intuitively it follows that the amyloid peptide is the ideal target to combat this disease. However several anti-Abeta therapies failed in clinical trials devoted to find a treatment for AD. However last year the results of a clinical trial prompted back the interests in this type of therapy. In this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine Martinez Hernandez and colleagues present encouraging results showing that the diphenylpyrazole compound Anle138b prevents and reduces the toxic effects of Abeta in a mouse model of AD (APPPS1DELTAE9). Regarding the mechanisms of action they present good evidence that Anle138b prevents the formation of conducting Abeta pores on artificial membranes and primary hippocampal neurons. While the data are encouraging AD mouse models only represent part of the AD pathology and clinical trials are needed to determine the usefulness of Anle138b to treat AD patients.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate methods for meta‐regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta‐regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta‐regression should be weighted to take account of both within‐trial variances of treatment effects and the residual between‐trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta‐regression. The associations derived from meta‐regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta‐regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using meta‐regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.

AB  - Background Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure. We have investigated synaptic plasticity in area CA1 in a novel AD mouse model (APPPS1-21) which expresses the Swedish mutation of APP and the L166P mutation of human PS-1. This model shows initial plaque formation at 2 months in the neocortex and 4 months in the hippocampus and displays β−amyloid-associated pathologies and learning impairments. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested long-term potentiation (LTP) and short term potentiation (paired-pulse facilitation, PPF) of synaptic transmission in vivo in area CA1 of the hippocampus. There was no difference in LTP or PPF at 4–5 months of age in APPPS1-21 mice compared to littermate controls. At 6 months of age there was also no difference in LTP but APPPS1-21 mice showed slightly increased PPF (p<0.03). In 8 months old mice, LTP was greatly impaired in APPPS-21 animals (p<0.0001) while PPF was not changed. At 15 months of age, APPPS1-21 mice showed again impaired LTP compared to littermate controls (p<0.005), and PPF was also significantly reduced at 80 ms (p<0.005) and 160 ms (p<0.01) interstimulus interval. Immunohistological analysis showed only modest amyloid deposition in the hippocampus at 4 and 6 months with a robust increase up to 15 months of age. Conclusions Our results suggest that increased formation and aggregation of beta amyloid with aging is responsible for the impaired LTP with aging in this mouse model, while the transient increase of PPF at 6 months of age is caused by some other mechanism.

AB  - The language and conceptual framework of “research reproducibility” are nonstandard and unsettled across the sciences. In this Perspective, we review an array of explicit and implicit definitions of reproducibility and related terminology, and discuss how to avoid potential misunderstandings when these terms are used as a surrogate for “truth.”

AB  - Animal models are indispensable tools for Alzheimer disease (AD) research. Over the course of more than two decades, an increasing number of complementary rodent models has been generated. These models have facilitated testing hypotheses about the aetiology and progression of AD, dissecting the associated pathomechanisms and validating therapeutic interventions, thereby providing guidance for the design of human clinical trials. However, the lack of success in translating rodent data into therapeutic outcomes may challenge the validity of the current models. This Review critically evaluates the genetic and non-genetic strategies used in AD modelling, discussing their strengths and limitations, as well as new opportunities for the development of better models for the disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are complex human brain disorders that affect an increasing number of people worldwide. With the identification first of the proteins that aggregate in AD and FTLD brains and subsequently of pathogenic gene mutations that cause their formation in the familial cases, the foundation was laid for the generation of animal models. These recapitulate essential aspects of the human conditions; expression of mutant forms of the amyloid-β protein-encoding APP gene in mice reproduces amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque formation in AD, while that of mutant forms of the tau-encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene reproduces tau-containing neurofibrillary tangle formation, a lesion that is also prevalent in FTLD-Tau. The mouse models have been complemented by those in lower species such as C. elegans or Drosophila, highlighting the crucial role for Aβ and tau in human neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we will introduce selected AD/FTLD models and discuss how they were instrumental, by identifying deregulated mRNAs, miRNAs and proteins, in dissecting pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease. We will discuss some recent examples, which includes miRNA species that are specifically deregulated by Aβ, mitochondrial proteins that are targets of both Aβ and tau, and the nuclear splicing factor SFPQ that accumulates in the cytoplasm in a tau-dependent manner. These examples illustrate how a functional genomics approach followed by a careful validation in experimental models and human tissue leads to a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and FTLD and ultimately, may help in finding a cure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large numbers of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques are diagnostic markers for Alzheimer disease (AD), but lesser numbers of these lesions are also seen in nondemented elderly individuals. Much of the existing literature suggests that the NFTs of AD have a closer correlation with cognitive function than do amyloid plaques. Whether a similar relationship exists in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that frequently reflects a preclinical stage of AD, remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution patterns of beta-amyloid plaques and NFTs and the association of these lesions with memory performance in nondemented individuals. METHODS: We investigated regional distributions and neuropsychological correlates of NFTs and amyloid plaques in cognitively normal elderly persons and subjects with MCI who received neuropsychological testing before death. Subjects Eight nondemented subjects who volunteered to receive annual neuropsychological testing and agreed to brain donation were studied. Five subjects showed no cognitive impairment, and 3 were diagnosed with MCI. RESULTS: Distribution of NFTs followed a rigorous and hierarchical pattern, but distribution of amyloid plaques varied among individuals. Subjects with MCI displayed higher NFT densities than did nonimpaired subjects. In addition, NFT density in the temporal lobe correlated with memory scores, whereas density of amyloid plaques did not. CONCLUSIONS: Neurofibrillary tangles are more numerous in medial temporal lobe regions associated with memory function and show a relationship to performance on memory tests in nondemented individuals. These results suggest that NFTs may constitute a pathological substrate for memory loss not only in AD but also in normal aging and MCI.

AB  - Behavioral neuroscience research incorporates the identical high level of meticulous methodologies and exacting attention to detail as all other scientific disciplines. To achieve maximal rigor and reproducibility of findings, well-trained investigators employ a variety of established best practices. Here we explicate some of the requirements for rigorous experimental design and accurate data analysis in conducting mouse and rat behavioral tests. Novel object recognition is used as an example of a cognitive assay which has been conducted successfully with a range of methods, all based on common principles of appropriate procedures, controls, and statistics. Directors of Rodent Core facilities within Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers contribute key aspects of their own novel object recognition protocols, offering insights into essential similarities and less-critical differences. Literature cited in this review article will lead the interested reader to source papers that provide step-by-step protocols which illustrate optimized methods for many standard rodent behavioral assays. Adhering to best practices in behavioral neuroscience will enhance the value of animal models for the multiple goals of understanding biological mechanisms, evaluating consequences of genetic mutations, and discovering efficacious therapeutics.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure. A crucial part of the drug development pipeline involves testing therapeutic interventions in animal disease models. However, promising findings in preclinical experiments have not translated into clinical trial success. Reproducibility has often been cited as a major issue affecting biomedical research, where experimental results in one laboratory cannot be replicated in another. By using meta-research (research on research) approaches such as systematic reviews, researchers aim to identify and summarise all available evidence relating to a specific research question. By conducting a meta-analysis, researchers can also combine the results from different experiments statistically to understand the overall effect of an intervention and to explore reasons for variations seen across different publications. Systematic reviews of the preclinical Alzheimer’s disease literature could inform decision making, encourage research improvement, and identify gaps in the literature to guide future research. However, due to the vast amount of potentially useful evidence from animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, it remains difficult to make sense of and utilise this data effectively. Systematic reviews are common practice within evidence based medicine, yet their application to preclinical research is often limited by the time and resources required. In this thesis, I develop, build-upon, and implement automated meta-research approaches to collect, curate, and evaluate the preclinical Alzheimer’s literature. I searched several biomedical databases to obtain all research relevant to Alzheimer’s disease. I developed a novel deduplication tool to automatically identify and remove duplicate publications identified across different databases with minimal human effort. I trained a crowd of reviewers to annotate a subset of the publications identified and used this data to train a machine learning algorithm to screen through the remaining publications for relevance. I developed text-mining tools to extract model, intervention, and treatment information from publications and I improved existing automated tools to extract reported measures to reduce the risk of bias. Using these tools, I created a categorised database of research in transgenic Alzheimer’s disease animal models and created a visual summary of this dataset on an interactive, openly accessible online platform. Using the techniques described, I also identified relevant publications within the categorised dataset to perform systematic reviews of two key outcomes of interest in transgenic Alzheimer’s disease models: (1) synaptic plasticity and transmission in hippocampal slices and (2) motor activity in the open field test. Over 400,000 publications were identified across biomedical research databases, with 230,203 unique publications. In a performance evaluation across different preclinical datasets, the automated deduplication tool I developed could identify over 97% of duplicate citations and a had an error rate similar to that of human performance. When evaluated on a test set of publications, the machine learning classifier trained to identify relevant research in transgenic models performed was highly sensitive (captured 96.5% of relevant publications) and excluded 87.8% of irrelevant publications. Tools to identify the model(s) and outcome measure(s) within the full-text of publications may reduce the burden on reviewers and were found to be more sensitive than searching only the title and abstract of citations. Automated tools to assess risk of bias reporting were highly sensitive and could have the potential to monitor research improvement over time. The final dataset of categorised Alzheimer’s disease research contained 22,375 publications which were then visualised in the interactive web application. Within the application, users can see how many publications report measures to reduce the risk of bias and how many have been classified as using each transgenic model, testing each intervention, and measuring each outcome. Users can also filter to obtain curated lists of relevant research, allowing them to perform systematic reviews at an accelerated pace with reduced effort required to search across databases, and a reduced number of publications to screen for relevance. Both systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlighted failures to report key methodological information within publications. Poor transparency of reporting limited the statistical power I had to understand the sources of between-study variation. However, some variables were found to explain a significant proportion of the heterogeneity. Transgenic animal model had a significant impact on results in both reviews. For certain open field test outcomes, wall colour of the open field arena and the reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias were found to impact results. For in vitro electrophysiology experiments measuring synaptic plasticity, several electrophysiology parameters, including magnesium concentration of the recording solution, were found to explain a significant proportion of the heterogeneity. Automated meta-research approaches and curated web platforms summarising preclinical research could have the potential to accelerate the conduct of systematic reviews and maximise the potential of existing evidence to inform translation.

AB  - Background: Researchers who perform systematic searches across multiple databases often identify duplicate publications. Identifying such duplicates (&quot;deduplication&quot;) can be extremely time-consuming, but failure to remove these citations can, in the worst instance, lead to the wrongful inclusion of duplicate data. Many existing tools are not sensitive enough, lack interoperability with other tools, are not freely accessible, or are difficult to use without programming knowledge. Here, we report the performance of our Automated Systematic Search Deduplicator (ASySD), a novel tool to perform automated deduplication of systematic searches for biomedical reviews. Methods: We evaluated ASySD&#039;s performance on 5 unseen biomedical systematic search datasets of various sizes (1,845 - 79,880 citations), which had been deduplicated by human reviewers. We compared the performance of ASySD with Endnote&#039;s automated deduplication option and with the Systematic Review Accelerator Deduplication Module (SRA-DM). Results: ASySD identified more duplicates than either SRA-DM or Endnote, with a sensitivity in different datasets of 0.95 to 0.99. The false-positive rate was comparable to human performance, with a specificity of 0.94-0.99. The tool took less than 1 hour to deduplicate all datasets. Conclusions: For duplicate removal in biomedical systematic reviews, ASySD is a highly sensitive, reliable, and time-saving tool. It is open source and freely available online as both an R package and a user-friendly web application.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines are widely endorsed but compliance is limited. We sought to determine whether journal-requested completion of an ARRIVE checklist improves full compliance with the guidelines. In a randomised controlled trial, manuscripts reporting in vivo animal research submitted to PLOS ONE (March-June 2015) were allocated to either requested completion of an ARRIVE checklist or current standard practice. We measured the change in proportion of manuscripts meeting all ARRIVE guideline checklist items between groups. We randomised 1,689 manuscripts, 1,269 were sent for peer review and 762 accepted for publication. The request to complete an ARRIVE checklist had no effect on full compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Details of animal husbandry (ARRIVE sub-item 9a) was the only item to show improved reporting, from 52.1% to 74.1% (X2=34.0, df=1, p=2.1x10-7). These results suggest that other approaches are required to secure greater implementation of the ARRIVE guidelines.

AB  - Throughout the global coronavirus pandemic, we have seen an unprecedented volume of COVID-19 researchpublications. This vast body of evidence continues to grow, making it difficult for research users to keep up with the pace of evolving research findings. To enable the synthesis of this evidence for timely use by researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders, we developed an automated workflow to collect, categorise, and visualise the evidence from primary COVID-19 research studies. We trained a crowd of volunteer reviewers to annotate studies by relevance to COVID-19, study objectives, and methodological approaches. Using these human decisions, we are training machine learning classifiers and applying text-mining tools to continually categorise the findings and evaluate the quality of COVID-19 evidence.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 35 million people today. The search for new treatments is made ever more urgent by prospects for increasing prevalence due to population aging. Mouse models are one of the most important research tools for finding new treatments for AD. Here, we review those models. We begin by briefly reviewing the AD genetics on which mouse models are based and then consider the most common mouse models of AD, including mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and beta-amyloid (Aβ), mice expressing mutant presenilin genes, mice modeling tau's role in AD, and apolipoprotein E models. The discussion highlights key features and important differences between these mouse models. We conclude with a discussion about the role of AD mouse models in the translational pipeline.

AB  - This paper concerns the validity of assuming that defecation and urination in rats are indicative of emotional differences. These two measures were "validated against the number of days during which the rat ate food in the field. It was assumed that the rat's failure to eat was a sign of emotionality, since food was readily obtainable and under normal living conditions the rats did eat within the time set for the experimental period." When all other factors were controlled, the correlation between number of days not eating and number of days defecating was found to be .82. For urinating and not eating the correlation was .70. It is assumed that the strangeness of the field situation serves as the emotional stimulus. The question of the generality of this emotionality is raised, but not answered. The author says that "the availability of measures of intensity of emotionality should facilitate investigations in the domain of emotional behavior."

AB  - Background Finding duplicates is an important phase of systematic review. However, no consensus regarding the methods to find duplicates has been provided. This study aims to describe a pragmatic strategy of combining auto- and hand-searching duplicates in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of duplicates. Methods and Findings Literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) were searched by the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. Duplicates included one index paper and one or more redundant papers. They were divided into type-I (duplicates among different databases) and type-II (duplicate publications in different journals/issues) duplicates. For type-I duplicates, reference items were further compared between index and redundant papers. Of 10936 papers regarding PVT, 2399 and 1307 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 11.0% (1201/10936) and 6.1% (665/10936), respectively. They included 3431 type-I and 275 type-II duplicates. Of 11403 papers regarding BCS, 3275 and 2064 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 14.4% (1640/11403) and 9.1% (1039/11403), respectively. They included 5053 type-I and 286 type-II duplicates. Most of type-I duplicates were identified by auto-searching method (69.5%, 2385/3431 in PVT literatures; 64.6%, 3263/5053 in BCS literatures). Nearly all type-II duplicates were identified by hand-searching method (94.9%, 261/275 in PVT literatures; 95.8%, 274/286 in BCS literatures). Compared with those identified by auto-searching method, type-I duplicates identified by hand-searching method had a significantly higher prevalence of wrong items (47/2385 versus 498/1046, p<0.0001 in PVT literatures; 30/3263 versus 778/1790, p<0.0001 in BCS literatures). Most of wrong items originated from EMBASE database. Conclusion Given the inadequacy of a single strategy of auto-searching method, a combined strategy of auto- and hand-searching methods should be employed to find duplicates in systematic review.

AB  - Due to problems of publication bias and selective reporting, the ICMJE requires prospective registration of all clinical trials with an appropriate registry before the first participant is enrolled. Previous research has shown that not all clinical trials are registered at this time (prospectively). This study investigated the extent and timing of trial registration. The aims were to determine 1) the proportion of clinical trials that were registered prospectively or retrospectively and 2) when retrospective registration took place in relation to submission to the journal in which they were published.

AB  - Physical exercise and fitness have been proposed as potential factors that promote healthy cognitive aging. Some of the support for this hypothesis has come from animal research. Animal studies are also used to propose the physiological mechanisms underlying the cognitive performance improvement associated with exercise. In the present review and meta-analysis, we discuss several methodological problems that limit the contribution of animal studies to the understanding of the putative effects of exercise on cognitive aging. We suggest that the most likely measure to equate exercise intensity in rodent and humans may be oxygen consumption (VO2) because observed values are surprisingly similar in young and older rodents and humans. For practical reasons, several animal studies use young rodents kept in social isolation. We show that social isolation is associated with an enhanced impact of exercise on cognitive performance but not on some physiological measures thought to mediate the effect of exercise. Surprisingly, two months or more of exercise intervention appeared to be ineffective to promote cognitive performance compared to shorter durations. We argue that impact of exercise in socially isolated animals is explained by an alleviation of environmental impoverishment as much as an effect of physical exercise. It is possible that the introduction of exercise in rodents is partly mediated by environmental changes. It may explain why larger effects are observed for the shorter durations of exercise while much smaller effects are found after longer periods of exercise.

AB  - Although the cognitive and biological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are well known and mouse models of AD are available, current treatments for AD-related cognitive deficits have quite limited efficacy. The development of tasks with cross-species validity may enable better prediction of the efficacy of potential new treatments. In this issue of the JCI, Possin et al. present a virtual version of the Morris water maze (a common test of spatial learning and memory for rodents) that is designed for use with humans. The authors tested a mouse model of AD (transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein [hAPP]) and patients in the earlier mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD in their respective versions of the maze. Using novel statistical methods, they detected similar deficits across species, providing support for the hAPP model and use of the virtual water maze. Importantly, this work enabled recommendations for appropriate sample sizes when developing potential therapeutics for AD.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and will lead to a worldwide public health crisis if it continues unchecked. Despite tremendous advances in our scientific understanding of AD, we still do not have effective ways to delay, prevent, or slow this disease. At the 2011 Abelson meeting, a diverse group of scientists discussed current challenges in the AD field and made recommendations in the areas of genetics, clinical trials, protein aggregation, and the cell biology of the nervous system. We hope these recommendations will boost research progress in AD and increase the likelihood of developing effective therapies in the near future.

AB  - Background In February 2008, the results of the PRObiotics in PAncreatitis TRIAl (PROPATRIA) were published. This study investigated the use of probiotics in patients suffering from severe acute pancreatitis. No differences between the groups were found for any of the primary endpoints. However, mortality in the probiotics group was significantly higher than in the placebo group. This result was unexpected in light of the results of the animal studies referred to in the trial protocol. We used the methods of systematic review and meta-analysis to take a closer look at the relation between the animal studies on probiotics and pancreatitis and the PROPATRIA-trial, focussing on indications for harmful effects and efficacy. Methods and results Both PubMed and Embase were searched for original articles concerning the effects of probiotics in experimental acute pancreatitis, yielding thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria. Data on mortality, bacterial translocation and histological damage to the pancreas were extracted, as well as study quality indicators. Meta-analysis of the four animal studies published before PROPATRIA showed that probiotic supplementation did not diminish mortality, reduced the overall histopathological score of the pancreas and reduced bacterial translocation to pancreas and mesenteric lymph nodes. Comparable results were found when all relevant studies published so far were taken into account. Conclusions A more thorough analysis of all relevant animal studies carried out before (and after) the publication of the study protocol of the PROPATRIA trial could not have predicted the harmful effects of probiotics found in the PROPATRIA-trial. Moreover, meta-analysis of the preclinical animal studies did show evidence for efficacy. It may be suggested, however, that the most appropriate animal experiments in relation to the design of the human trial have not yet been conducted, which compromises a fair comparison between the results of the animal studies and the PROPATRIA trial.

AB  - In research aimed at improving human health care, animal studies still play a crucial role, despite political and scientific efforts to reduce preclinical experimentation in laboratory animals. In animal studies, the results and their interpretation are not always straightforward, as no single study is executed perfectly in all steps. There are several possible sources of bias, and many animal studies are replicates of studies conducted previously. Use of meta-analysis to combine the results of studies may lead to more reliable conclusions and a reduction of unnecessary duplication of animal studies. In addition, due to the more exploratory nature of animal studies as compared to clinical trials, meta-analyses of animal studies have greater potential in exploring possible sources of heterogeneity.There is an abundance of literature on how to perform meta-analyses on clinical data. Animal studies, however, differ from clinical studies in some aspects, such as the diversity of animal species studied, experimental design, and study characteristics. In this paper, we will discuss the main principles and practices for meta-analyses of experimental animal studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in using machine learning approaches to priority rank studies and reduce human burden in screening literature when conducting systematic reviews. In addition, identifying addressable questions during the problem formulation phase of systematic review can be challenging, especially for topics having a large literature base. Here, we assess the performance of the SWIFT-Review priority ranking algorithm for identifying studies relevant to a given research question. We also explore the use of SWIFT-Review during problem formulation to identify, categorize, and visualize research areas that are data rich/data poor within a large literature corpus. METHODS: Twenty case studies, including 15 public data sets, representing a range of complexity and size, were used to assess the priority ranking performance of SWIFT-Review. For each study, seed sets of manually annotated included and excluded titles and abstracts were used for machine training. The remaining references were then ranked for relevance using an algorithm that considers term frequency and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. This ranking was evaluated with respect to (1) the number of studies screened in order to identify 95 % of known relevant studies and (2) the "Work Saved over Sampling" (WSS) performance metric. To assess SWIFT-Review for use in problem formulation, PubMed literature search results for 171 chemicals implicated as EDCs were uploaded into SWIFT-Review (264,588 studies) and categorized based on evidence stream and health outcome. Patterns of search results were surveyed and visualized using a variety of interactive graphics. RESULTS: Compared with the reported performance of other tools using the same datasets, the SWIFT-Review ranking procedure obtained the highest scores on 11 out of 15 of the public datasets. Overall, these results suggest that using machine learning to triage documents for screening has the potential to save, on average, more than 50 % of the screening effort ordinarily required when using un-ordered document lists. In addition, the tagging and annotation capabilities of SWIFT-Review can be useful during the activities of scoping and problem formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Text-mining and machine learning software such as SWIFT-Review can be valuable tools to reduce the human screening burden and assist in problem formulation.

AB  - For decades, statisticians and clinicians have debated the meaning of statistical and clinical significance. In general, most journals remain married to the frequentist approach to statistical testing and using the term statistical significance. A recent proposal to ban statistical significance gained campaign-level momentum in a commentary with 854 recruited signatories. The petition proposes retaining P values but abandoning dichotomous statements (significant/nonsignificant), suggests discussing “compatible” effect sizes, denounces “proofs of the null,” and points out that “crucial effects” are dismissed on discovery or refuted on replication because of nonsignificance. The proposal also indicates that “we should never conclude there is ‘no difference’ or ‘no association’ just because a P value is larger than a threshold such as 0.05 or, equivalently, because a confidence interval includes zero,” and that categorization based on other statistical measures (eg, Bayes factors) should be discouraged. Other recent articles have also addressed similar topics, with an entire supplemental issue of a statistics journal devoted to issues related to P values.

AB  - Background: Clinical trials for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have had a high failure rate (99.6%). The reasons may include insufficient disease understanding lack of targeting to the right stage of disease or patient population and insufficient drug exposure in the brain. To maximize the learning from past clinical experience we established a single mechanistic mathematical model of mild/moderate AD describing molecular mechanisms leading to plaque formation with the help of clinical biomarkers and capture the effects of multiple anti-amyloid beta (Ab) monoclonal antibodies and amyloid targeting beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors. Method(s): The AD model includes three different pools of Ab species: monomer soluble oligomer and plaque and describes Ab production aggregation the intercompartment transport as well as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of plaque. The model was informed by data from stable isotope labeling kinetics experiments molecular binding and clinical biomarker data for four anti-Ab monoclonal antibodies (Aducanumab Crenezumab Solanezumab Bapineuzumab) and three small molecule BACE inhibitors (Elenbecestat Verubecestat Atabecestat). Result(s): The model was calibrated to capture plasma and CSF drug PK Ab levels and plaque burden from published clinical studies. Because of the complexity of Ab species binding affinities of antibodies to these species can be difficult to measure and often a wide range of values is reported for the same antibody. By fitting the model to all available Ab data in different compartments we were able to estimate apparent in vivo affinities to different Ab species for the four anti-Ab antibodies. Our analyses indicate that for drugs that showed no or minimal plaque reduction in clinical studies doses that are higher than those tested could lead to plaque reduction. Drugs that induce ADCP can lead to significant plaque reduction at lower doses and with faster kinetics than drugs that do not include this mechanism. Conclusion(s): We have developed a mechanistic mathematical model to analyze treatment effects of anti-Ab antibodies and BACE inhibitors on soluble Ab species and plaque. The results allow us to compare the effects of various drugs mechanisms and combinations on plaque burden. In the future the model will be expanded to capture drug effects at different stages of disease.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Calcium homeostasis plays a major role in maintaining neuronal function under physiological conditions. Amyloid-β (Aβ) initiates pathological processes that include disruption in intracellular calcium levels so amelioration of the calcium alteration could serve as an indirect functional indicator of treatment efficacy. Therefore calcium dynamics were used as a measure of functional outcome. We evaluated the effects of the anti-Aβ antibody aducanumab on calcium homeostasis and plaque clearance in aged Tg2576 mice with in vivo multiphoton imaging. Acute topical application of aducanumab to the brain resulted in clearance of amyloid plaques. Although chronic systemic administration of aducanumab in 22-month-old mice did not clear existing plaques calcium overload was ameliorated over time. Therefore this antibody likely restores neuronal network function that possibly underlies cognitive deficits indicating promise as a clinical treatment. In addition functional readouts such as calcium overload may be a more useful outcome measure to monitor treatment efficacy in models of Alzheimer's disease compared with amyloid burden alone. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is currently without a cure. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid-β antibody being developed for the treatment of AD. Interim analyses of a phase 1b clinical trial have suggested potential beneficial effects on amyloid pathology and cognitive status in patients treated with aducanumab (Sevigny et al. 2016). Here we show that a murine analog of aducanumab clears amyloid plaques in an acute setting and restores calcium homeostasis disrupted in a mouse model of AD upon chronic treatment. Therefore we demonstrate that aducanumab reverses a functional outcome measure reflective of neural network activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) antibody that achieved reduced amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials; however it is controversial whether it also improved cognition which has been suggested would require a sufficiently high cumulative dose of the antibody in the brain. Therapeutic ultrasound in contrast has only begun to be investigated in human AD clinical trials. We have previously shown that scanning ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS) which temporarily and safely opens the blood-brain barrier (BBB) removes amyloid and restores cognition in APP23 mice. However there has been no direct testing of how the effects of SUS compare to immunotherapy or whether a combination therapy is more effective. METHODS: In a study comprising four treatment arms we tested the efficacy of an Aducanumab analog Adu both in comparison to SUS and as a combination therapy in APP23 mice (aged 13-22 months) using sham as a control. The active place avoidance (APA) test was used to test spatial memory and histology and ELISA were used to measure amyloid. Brain antibody levels were also determined. RESULTS: We found that both Adu and SUS reduced the total plaque area in the hippocampus with no additive effect observed with the combination treatment (SUS + Adu). Whereas in the cortex where there was a trend towards reducing the total plaque area from either Adu or SUS only the combination treatment yielded a statistically significant decrease in total plaque area compared to sham. Only the SUS and SUS + Adu groups included animals that had their plaque load reduced to below 1% from above 10%. There was a robust improvement in spatial memory for the SUS + Adu group only and in this group the level of Adu when measured 3 days post-treatment was 5-fold higher compared to those mice that received Adu on its own. Together these findings suggest that SUS should be considered as a treatment option for AD. Alternatively a combination trial using Aducanumab together with ultrasound to increase brain levels of the antibody may be warranted.

AB  - The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD despite of the many clinical setbacks. It has been problematic to use conjugated peptides with Th1/Th2 adjuvants to induce immune responses against conformational epitopes formed by Aβ oligomers which is critical to induce protective antibodies. Hence vaccination should mimic natural immunity by using whole or if possible conjugated antigens but biasing the response to Th2 with anti-inflammatory adjuvants. Also selection of the carrier and cross-linking agents is important to prevent suppression of the immune response against the antigen. That certain compounds having phosphorylcholine or fucose induce a sole Th2 immunity would allow antigens with T-cell epitopes without inflammatory autoimmune reactions to be used. Another immunization method is DNA vaccines combined with antigenic ones which favors the clonal selection and expansion of high affinity antibodies needed for immune protection but this also requires Th2 immunity. Since AD transgenic mouse models have limited value for immunogen selection as shown by the clinical studies screening may require the use of validated antibodies and biophysical methods to identify the antigens that would be most likely recognized by the human immune system and thus capable to stimulate a protective antibody response. To induce an anti-Alzheimer's disease protective immunity and prevent possible damage triggered by antigens having B-cell epitopes-only whole antigens might be used; while inducing Th2 immunity with sole anti-inflammatory fucose-based adjuvants. This approach would avert a damaging systemic inflammatory immunity and the suppression of immunoresponse against the antigen because of carrier and cross-linkers; immune requirements that extend to DNA vaccines.

That certain compounds having phosphorylcholine or fucose induce a sole Th2 immunity would allow antigens with T-cell epitopes without inflammatory autoimmune reactions to be used. Another immunization method is DNA vaccines combined with antigenic ones which favors the clonal selection and expansion of high affinity antibodies needed for immune protection but this also requires Th2 immunity. Since AD transgenic mouse models have limited value for immunogen selection as shown by the clinical studies screening may require the use of validated antibodies and biophysical methods to identify the antigens that would be most likely recognized by the human immune system and thus capable to stimulate a protective antibody response.

AB  - The apparently near-term effects of the monoclonal antibody BAN2401 in slowing the progression of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) has created cautious optimism about the therapeutic use of antibodies that neutralize cytotoxic soluble amyloid-β aggregates rather than removing plaque. Plaque being protective as it immobilizes cytotoxic amyloid-β rather than AD's causative agent. The presence of natural antibodies against cytotoxic amyloid-β implies the existence of a protective anti-AD immunity. Hence for vaccines to induce a similar immunoresponse that prevents and/or delays the onset of AD they must have adjuvants that stimulate a sole anti-inflammatory Th2 immunity plus immunogens that induce a protective immunoresponse against diverse cytotoxic amyloid-β conformers. Indeed amyloid-β pleomorphism may explain the lack of long-term protection by monoclonal antibodies that neutralize single conformers like aducanumab. A situation that would allow new cytotoxic conformers to escape neutralization by previously effective monoclonal antibodies. Stimulation of a vaccine's effective immunoresponse would require the concurrent delivery of immunogen to dendritic cells and their priming to induce a polarized Th2 immunity. An immunoresponse that would produce besides neutralizing antibodies against neurotoxic amyloid-β oligomers anti-inflammatory cytokines; preventing inflammation that aggravates AD. Because of age-linked immune decline vaccines would be significantly more effective in preventing rather than treating AD. Considering the amyloid-β's role in tau's pathological hyperphosphorylation and their synergism in AD the development of preventive vaccines against both amyloid-β and tau should be considered. Due to convenience and cost vaccines may be the only option available to many countries to forestall the impending AD epidemic.

AB  - Project description: A remarkable rise in life expectancy during the past century has made Alzheimer's disease the most common form of progressive mental failure. Patients with AD lose their most human qualities - reasoning abstraction judgement language and memory. Biochemical analyses of classical brain lesions that Alois Alzheimer described - the senile (amyloid) plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles - preceded and guided the search for genetic alterations that underlie AD. In the 1990s four genes were strongly linked to inheritance of early Alzheimer's disease. Mutations or variations in these four genes all cause accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain with subsequent alteration of the tau protein into tangles as well as inflammation and neurodegeneration in brain regions serving memory and cognition. Recently other genes have been found to confer a heightened risk of typical AD and some have already been shown to increase Abeta levels in various ways. This growing understanding of "genotypeto- phenotype" relationships in familial AD coupled with innumerable cell culture and animal model studies of the process have now led to specific strategies to lower brain Abeta levels in order to treat and prevent AD. Although there has been a healthy debate about this 'amyloid (Abeta) hypothesis' new evidence further supports the idea that an imbalance between production and clearance of Abeta42 may be an initiating factor in AD. For example inheriting the apoE4 gene which strongly predisposes to AD impairs clearance of Abeta from the brain. "Oligomers" (doublets quadruplets etc.) of Abeta isolated from AD brains can decrease synapse numbr and inhibit synapse function in animals and injecting the oligomers into healthy adult rats impairs their memory. Abeta oligomers modify the tau protein in AD-relevant ways. Human biomarker studies show that low CSF Abeta42 levels and high amyloid plaque levels on PET scans precede other AD features by many years. Recent human trials of an Abeta antibody (aducanumab) led to dosedependent removal of amyloid plaques from the brain accompanied by an apparent slowing of cognitive decline. Although many other factors contribute toAD Abeta accumulation has emerged as themost extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.

Soluble oligomers of Aβ42 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number inhibit long-term potentiation and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In humans new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and amyloid-PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly recent trials of three different Aβ antibodies (solanezumab crenezumab and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects. Although many factors contribute to AD pathogenesis Aβ dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.

AB  - Dynamic gain and loss of synapses is fundamental to healthy brain function. While Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment strategies have largely focussed on beta-amyloid and tau protein pathologies, the synapse itself may also be a critical endpoint to consider regarding disease modification. Disruption of mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, eventually resulting in a net loss of synapses, is implicated as an early pathological event in AD. Synaptic dysfunction therefore may be a final common biological mechanism linking protein pathologies to disease symptoms. This review summarizes evidence supporting the idea of early neuroplastic deficits being prevalent in AD. Changes in synaptic density can occur before overt neurodegeneration and should not be considered to uniformly decrease over the course of the disease. Instead, synaptic levels are influenced by an interplay between processes of degeneration and atrophy, and those of maintenance and compensation at regional and network levels. How these neuroplastic changes are driven by amyloid and tau pathology are varied. A mixture of direct effects of amyloid and tau on synaptic integrity, as well as indirect effects on processes such as inflammation and neuronal energetics are likely to be at play here. Focussing on the synapse and mechanisms of neuroplasticity as therapeutic opportunities in AD raises some important conceptual and strategic issues regarding translational research, and how preclinical research can inform clinical studies. Nevertheless, substrates of neuroplasticity represent an emerging complementary class of drug target that would aim to normalize synapse dynamics and restore cognitive function in the AD brain and in other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is endoproteolytically processed by BACE1 and γ-secretase to release amyloid peptides (Aβ40 and 42) that aggregate to form senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The C-terminus of Aβ40/42 is generated by γ-secretase, whose activity is dependent upon presenilin (PS 1 or 2). Missense mutations in PS1 (and PS2) occur in patients with early-onset familial AD (FAD), and previous studies in transgenic mice and cultured cell models demonstrated that FAD-PS1 variants shift the ratio of Aβ40 : 42 to favor Aβ42. One hypothesis to explain this outcome is that mutant PS alters the specificity of γ-secretase to favor production of Aβ42 at the expense of Aβ40. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied Aβ40 and 42 levels in a series of transgenic mice that co-express the Swedish mutation of APP (APPswe) with two FAD-PS1 variants that differentially accelerate amyloid pathology in the brain. We demonstrate a direct correlation between the concentration of Aβ42 and the rate of amyloid deposition. We further show that the shift in Aβ42 : 40 ratios associated with the expression of FAD-PS1 variants is due to a specific elevation in the steady-state levels of Aβ42, while maintaining a constant level of Aβ40. These data suggest that PS1 variants do not simply alter the preferred cleavage site for γ-secretase, but rather that they have more complex effects on the regulation of γ-secretase and its access to substrates.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is behaviorally identified by progressive memory impairment and pathologically characterized by the triad of β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration. Genetic mutations and risk factors have been identified that are either causal or modify the disease progression. These genetic and pathological features serve as basis for the creation and validation of mouse models of AD. Efforts made in the past quarter-century have produced over 100 genetically engineered mouse lines that recapitulate some aspects of AD clinicopathology. These models have been valuable resources for understanding genetic interactions that contribute to disease and cellular reactions that are engaged in response. Here we focus on mouse models that have been widely used stalwarts of the field or that are recently developed bellwethers of the future. Rather than providing a summary of each model, we endeavor to compare and contrast the genetic approaches employed and to discuss their respective advantages and limitations. We offer a critical account of the variables which may contribute to inconsistent findings and the factors that should be considered when choosing a model and interpreting the results. We hope to present an insightful review of current AD mouse models and to provide a practical guide for selecting models best matched to the experimental question at hand.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and intellectual deficits and behavior disturbance. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a tool for diagnosing AD for several decades. The hallmark of EEG abnormalities in AD patients is a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies and a decrease in coherence of fast rhythms. These abnormalities are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among cortical areas resulting from death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, cholinergic deficits, etc. This article reviews main findings of EEG abnormalities in AD patients obtained from conventional spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamical methods. In particular, nonlinear alterations in the EEG of AD patients, i.e. a decreased complexity of EEG patterns and reduced information transmission among cortical areas, and their clinical implications are discussed. For future studies, improvement of the accuracy of differential diagnosis and early detection of AD based on multimodal approaches, longitudinal studies on nonlinear dynamics of the EEG, drug effects on the EEG dynamics, and linear and nonlinear functional connectivity among cortical regions in AD are proposed to be investigated. EEG abnormalities of AD patients are characterized by slowed mean frequency, less complex activity, and reduced coherences among cortical regions. These abnormalities suggest that the EEG has utility as a valuable tool for differential and early diagnosis of AD.

AB  - Background We analyze the dynamics of rodent EEG amplitude in an experiment accompanied by video recordings. Brain activity of animals is commonly acquired together with a video of behavior, but recordings are rarely combined in analysis. The data acquired is most commonly analyzed separately. To our knowledge, no study has used behavior to improve the analysis of EEG waveforms, specifically for artifact removal – other than through manual editing. Comparison with existing method(s) We explore two approaches: a traditional approach that relies on data preprocessing and artifact rejection by an expert; and an alternative approach that combines analysis of EEG with behavior extracted from video recordings. New method We use the level of activity extracted from the behavioral video as a measure of confidence in the acquired EEG waveform, and as a weighting factor in averaging and statistical comparisons. Results We find in analysis of the EEG that the two approaches lead to similar conclusions, but the analysis leveraging behavioral data achieves this while avoiding many subjective choices often required for artifact rejection and data preprocessing. Conclusions The methods we describe allow for the inclusion of all recorded data in the analysis, thereby making statistical tests more friendly to interpretation, and making the data processing transparent and reproducible.

AB  - Experiments that use the mouse as a model for disease have recently come under scrutiny because of the repeated failure of data, particularly derived from preclinical studies, to be replicated or translated to humans. The usefulness of mouse models has been questioned because of irreproducibility and poor recapitulation of human conditions. Newer studies, however, point to bias in reporting results and improper data analysis as key factors that limit reproducibility and validity of preclinical mouse research. Inaccurate and incomplete descriptions of experimental conditions also contribute. Here, we provide guidance on best practice in mouse experimentation, focusing on appropriate selection and validation of the model, sources of variation and their influence on phenotypic outcomes, minimum requirements for control sets, and the importance of rigorous statistics. Our goal is to raise the standards in mouse disease modeling to enhance reproducibility, reliability and clinical translation of findings.

AB  - Since sleep and electroencephalogram (EEG) disturbances are endophenotypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients alongside cognitive dysfunction, we here characterized these parameters in transgenic mice carrying transgenes for amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPPswe) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1A246E) at 5 (pre-plaque) and 20 months, relative to PSEN1 and wild-type (WT) mice, using a novel wireless microchip device. While circadian rhythms were not affected, we obtained significantly higher overall activity at 5 months in the AbetaPP/PSEN1 strain (p < 0.001) compared to both PSEN1 and WT animals. Vigilance staging revealed that AbetaPP/PSEN1 animals present with an age-independent increase in wakefulness (p < 0.001) and a decrease in non rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep (p < 0.01). These changes were age- and genotype-dependent only during the light phase, while dark phase activity pattern were equally affected at both ages. In all genotypes, the amount of REM sleep was lower at 20 months indicating a general age-related profile. Spectral power of qEEG changed in AbetaPP/PSEN1 mice at 5 months during wakefulness and REM sleep; during wakefulness hippocampal delta (0.5-5 Hz) was reduced and theta (5-9 Hz) power enhanced. By contrast, NREM EEG spectra were affected by age and genotype. Interestingly, PSEN1 animals also showed spectral EEG changes, these differed from both WT and AbetaPP/PSEN1 animals. Our results indicate that AbetaPP/PSEN1 mice exhibit abnormalities in activity and sleep architecture preceding amyloid plaque deposition as well as age-related changes in cortical EEG power. Though not fully recapitulating the profile of AD patients, this suggests activity and EEG recordings as sensitive and translational biomarkers in murine models.

AB  - Toxic amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) are known to accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in animal models of AD. Their structure is heterogeneous and they are found in both intracellular and extracellular milieu. When given to CNS cultures or injected ICV into non-human primates and other non-transgenic animals AbetaOs have been found to cause impaired synaptic plasticity loss of memory function tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation synapse elimination oxidative and ER stress inflammatory microglial activation and selective nerve cell death. Memory loss and pathology in transgenic models are prevented by AbetaO antibodies while Aducanumab an antibody that targets AbetaOs as well as fibrillar Abeta has provided cognitive benefit to humans in early clinical trials. AbetaOs have now been investigated in more than 3000 studies and are widely thought to be the major toxic form of Abeta. Although much has been learned about the downstream mechanisms of AbetaO action a major gap concerns the earliest steps: How do AbetaOs initially interact with surface membranes to generate neuron-damaging transmembrane events? Findings from Ohnishi et al (PNAS 2005) combined with new results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that AbetaOs act as neurotoxins because they attach to particular membrane protein docks containing Na/K ATPase-alpha3 where they inhibit ATPase activity and pathologically restructure dock composition and topology in a manner leading to excessive Ca++ build-up. Better understanding of the mechanism that makes attachment of AbetaOs to vulnerable neurons a neurotoxic phenomenon should open the door to therapeutics and diagnostics targeting the first step of a complex pathway that leads to neural damage and dementia.

AB  - Abstract The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a considerable socio‐economic challenge. Decades of experimental research have not led to the development of effective disease modifying interventions. A deeper understanding of in vivo research might provide insights to inform future in vivo research and clinical trial design. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of interventions tested in transgenic mouse models of AD. We searched electronically for publications testing interventions in transgenic models of AD. We extracted data for outcome, study characteristics and reported study quality and calculated summary estimates of efficacy using random effects meta‐analysis. We identified 427 publications describing 357 interventions in 55 transgenic models, involving 11,118 animals in 838 experiments. Of concern, reported study quality was relatively low; fewer than one in four publications reported the blinded assessment of outcome or random allocation to group and no study reported a sample size calculation. Additionally, there were few data for any individual intervention—only 16 interventions had outcomes described in 5 or more publications. Finally, “trim and fill” analyses suggested one in seven pathological and neurobehavioural experiments remain unpublished. Given these historical weaknesses in the in vivo modelling of AD in transgenic animals and the identified risks of bias, clinical trials that are based on claims of efficacy in animals should only proceed after a detailed critical appraisal of those animal data.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep, which are thought to reflect an impairment of internal circadian timekeeping that contribute to clinical symptoms and disease progression. To evaluate these hypotheses, a suitable preclinical model of AD is needed. We performed a comprehensive assessment of circadian rhythms and sleep in the APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model using long-term in vivo electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and behavioral assays from 5 to 22 months of age. APP/PS1 mice were crossed with a PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) mouse model to evaluate synchrony among peripheral circadian oscillators. The APP/PS1 mice exhibited a mild but persistent phase delay of nocturnal activity onset in 12:12h light:dark conditions, as well as a shift toward higher frequencies in the EEG power spectra compared to littermate controls. Our results suggest that APP/PS1 mice may not be the optimal preclinical model for studying the specific circadian changes associated with AD but that quantitative EEG may offer a sensitive measure of AD-associated changes in sleep quality that can be modeled in APP/PS1 mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances have long been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is a growing interest in how these disturbances might impact AD pathophysiology. Despite this growing interest, surprisingly little is known about how sleep architecture and the broader neuronal network are affected in widely used transgenic mouse models of AD. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed sleep and electroencephalography (EEG) power in three transgenic mouse models of AD, using identical and commercially available hardware and analytical software. The goal was to assess the suitability of these mouse lines to model sleep and the broader neuronal network dysfunction measured by EEG in AD. METHODS: Tg2576, APP/PS1, and 3xTgAD transgenic AD mice were studied using in vivo EEG recordings for sleep/wake time and power spectral analysis. RESULTS: Both the APP/PS1 model at 8- 10 months and the Tg2576 model at 12 months of age exhibited stage-dependent decreases in theta and delta power, and shifts in the power spectra toward higher frequencies. Stage-dependent power spectral analyses showed no changes in the 3xTgAD model at 18 months of age. The percentage of time spent awake, in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), or in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) was not different between genotypes in any of the transgenic lines. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with data from several other transgenic AD models as well as certain studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Further studies will be needed to better understand the correlation between EEG spectra and AD pathophysiology, both in AD models and the human condition.

AB  - The current development of immunotherapy for Alzheimer’s disease is based on the assumption that human-derived amyloid β protein (Aβ) can be targeted in a similar manner to animal cell-derived or synthetic Aβ. Because the structure of Aβ depends on its source and the presence of co-factors, it is of great interest to determine if human-derived oligomeric Aβ species impair brain function and if so, whether or not their disruptive effects can be prevented using antibodies. We report that untreated ex vivo human cerebrospinal fluid that contains Aβ dimers rapidly inhibits hippocampal long-term potentiation in vivo and that acute systemic infusion of an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody can prevent this disruption of synaptic plasticity. Aβ monomer isolated from human CSF did not affect LTP. These results strongly support a strategy of passive immunization against soluble Aβ oligomers in early Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - One of the most clinically advanced forms of experimental disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer disease is immunization against the amyloid β protein (Aβ)1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but how this may prevent cognitive impairment is unclear8,9,10,11,12,13. We hypothesized that antibodies to Aβ could exert a beneficial action by directly neutralizing potentially synaptotoxic soluble Aβ species14,15,16 in the brain. Intracerebroventricular injection of naturally secreted human Aβ inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), a correlate of learning and memory17, in rat hippocampus in vivo but a monoclonal antibody to Aβ completely prevented the inhibition of LTP when injected after Aβ. Size fractionation showed that Aβ oligomers, not monomers or fibrils, were responsible for inhibiting LTP, and an Aβ antibody again prevented such inhibition. Active immunization against Aβ was partially effective, and the effects correlated positively with levels of antibodies to Aβ oligomers. The ability of exogenous and endogenous antibodies to rapidly neutralize soluble Aβ oligomers that disrupt synaptic plasticity in vivo suggests that treatment with such antibodies might show reversible cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer disease.

AB  - Light–dark box and open field are conventional tests for assessment of anxiety-like behavior in the laboratory mice, based on approach–avoidance conflict. However, except the basic principles, variations in the equipment and procedures are very common. Therefore, contribution of certain methodological issues in different settings was investigated. Three inbred strains (C57BL/6, 129/Sv, DBA/2) and one outbred stock (ICR) of mice were used in the experiments. An effect of initial placement of mice either in the light or dark compartment was studied in the light–dark test. Moreover, two tracking systems were applied — position of the animals was detected either by infrared sensors in square box (1/2 dark) or by videotracking in rectangular box (1/3 dark). Both approaches revealed robust and consistent strain differences in the exploratory behavior. In general, C57BL/6 and ICR mice showed reduced anxiety-like behavior as compared to 129/Sv and DBA/2 strains. However, the latter two strains differed markedly in their behavior. DBA/2 mice displayed high avoidance of the light compartment accompanied by thigmotaxis, whereas the hypoactive 129 mice spent a significant proportion of time in risk-assessment behavior at the opening between two compartments. Starting from the light side increased the time spent in the light compartment and reduced the latency to the first transition. In the open field arena, black floor promoted exploratory behavior — increased time and distance in the center and increased rearing compared to white floor. In conclusion, modifications of the apparatus and procedure had significant effects on approach–avoidance behavior in general whereas the strain rankings remained unaffected.

AB  - Background: The recent success of a Phase 1b clinical trial (antibody aducanumab; Biogen Idec) substantiates the hypothesis that aggregated forms of Abeta have a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Because amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) are widely regarded as the aggregated form of Abeta responsible for AD onset the therapeutic efficacy of aducanumab may come from targeting AbetaOs rather than amyloid plaques. AbetaOs accumulate early in AD and experimentally cause memory dysfunction and the major cellular pathologies associated with AD (e.g. tau abnormalities synapse loss oxidative damage etc.). An important resource currently unavailable to clinicians and researchers is an ultrasensitive assay for detection of AbetaO species at AD-relevant concentrations. Such an assay would have potential application to early diagnosis and therapeutics. Methods: We have developed an ultrasensitive AbetaO immunoassay (lower limit of quantification: 0.10 pg/mL = 20 fM) utilizing the research use only Erenna Immunoassay Platform (Singulex) and a highly AbetaO-specific human monoclonal antibody (ACU-193; Acumen). This antibody is unique compared to Abeta-targeting antibodies that have gone to clinical trials in that it has little to no affinity for monomers or fibrils. Results: With this assay we have detected 3-10 fmol AbetaOs per mg total protein in brain extracts of 5xFAD Tg mice at 3.5 months prior to the onset of memory loss. This preliminary data was obtained from 6 Tg mice and 3 wt littermates. At 24 months of age AbetaO levels in Tg mice are increased another 10-fold. Conclusions: This preliminary data provides further evidence for the early accumulation of AbetaOs in AD. Future applications of this immunoassay include: (1) AbetaO detection in human brain extracts and potentially concentrated CSF; and (2) when combined with HPLC-SEC characterization of the size distribution of AbetaOs throughout AD progression. Detection of specific populations of AbetaOs will fill a gap in our knowledge of the native structure of species prevalent over the course of AD and may show greater diagnostic potential than detection of whole AbetaO populations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite strong evidence linking amyloid beta (Aβ) to Alzheimer's disease most clinical trials have shown no clinical efficacy for reasons that remain unclear. To understand why we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model for seven therapeutics: aducanumab crenezumab solanezumab bapineuzumab elenbecestat verubecestat and semagacestat. METHODS: Ordinary differential equations were used to model the production transport and aggregation of Aβ; pharmacology of the drugs; and their impact on plaque. RESULTS: The calibrated model predicts that endogenous plaque turnover is slow with an estimated half-life of 2.75 years. This is likely why beta-secretase inhibitors have a smaller effect on plaque reduction. Of the mechanisms tested the model predicts binding to plaque and inducing antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis is the best approach for plaque reduction. DISCUSSION: A QSP model can provide novel insights to clinical results. Our model explains the results of clinical trials and provides guidance for future therapeutic development.

AB  - The discovery of gene mutations responsible for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has enabled researchers to reproduce in transgenic mice several hallmarks of this disorder, notably Aβ accumulation, though in most cases without neurofibrillary tangles. Mice expressing mutated and wild-type APP as well as C-terminal fragments of APP exhibit variations in exploratory activity reminiscent of behavioural and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer dementia (BPSD). In particular, open-field, spontaneous alternation, and elevated plus-maze tasks as well as aggression are modified in several APP transgenic mice relative to non-transgenic controls. However, depending on the precise murine models, changes in open-field and elevated plus-maze exploration occur in either direction, either increased or decreased relative to controls. It remains to be determined which neurotransmitter changes are responsible for this variability, in particular with respect to GABA, 5HT, and dopamine.

AB  - Cochrane Reviews are intended to help providers, practitioners and patients make informed decisions about health care. The goal of the Cochrane Applicability and Recommendation Methods Group (ARMG) is to develop approaches, strategies and guidance that facilitate the uptake of information from Cochrane Reviews and their use by a wide audience with specific focus on developers of recommendations and on healthcare decision makers. This paper is part of a series highlighting developments in systematic review methodology in the 20 years since the establishment of The Cochrane Collaboration, and its aim is to present current work and highlight future developments in assessing and presenting summaries of evidence, with special focus on Summary of Findings (SoF) tables and Plain Language Summaries.

AB  - Abstract This article challenges recent research (Evans, 2008) reporting that the concentration of cited scientific literature increases with the online availability of articles and journals. Using Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, the present article analyses changes in the concentration of citations received (2- and 5-year citation windows) by papers published between 1900 and 2005. Three measures of concentration are used: the percentage of papers that received at least one citation (cited papers); the percentage of papers needed to account for 20%, 50%, and 80% of the citations; and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). These measures are used for four broad disciplines: natural sciences and engineering, medical fields, social sciences, and the humanities. All these measures converge and show that, contrary to what was reported by Evans, the dispersion of citations is actually increasing.

AB  - Animal disease models are considered important in the development of drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This brief review will discuss possible reasons why their success in identifying efficacious treatments has been limited, and will provide some thoughts on the role of animal experimentation in drug development. Specifically, none of the current models of Alzheimer's disease have either construct or predictive validity, and no model probably ever will. Clearly, specific animal experiments contribute to our understanding of the disease and generate hypotheses. Ultimately, however, the hypothesis can only be tested in human patients and only with the proper tools. These tools are a pharmacologically active intervention (in humans) and a clinical trial suited to evaluate the mechanism of action. Integration of knowledge in quantitative (sub) models is considered important if not essential in this process.

AB  - Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity–intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity–intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%–29%) replicated the correct entity–intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%–53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26%–39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.

AB  - Societies invest in scientific studies to better understand the world and attempt to harness such improved understanding to address pressing societal problems. Published research, however, can be useful for theory or application only if it is credible. In science, a credible finding is one that has repeatedly survived risky falsification attempts. However, state-of-the-art meta-analytic approaches cannot determine the credibility of an effect because they do not account for the extent to which each included study has survived such attempted falsification. To overcome this problem, we outline a unified framework for estimating the credibility of published research by examining four fundamental falsifiability-related dimensions: (a) transparency of the methods and data, (b) reproducibility of the results when the same data-processing and analytic decisions are reapplied, (c) robustness of the results to different data-processing and analytic decisions, and (d) replicability of the effect. This framework includes a standardized workflow in which the degree to which a finding has survived scrutiny is quantified along these four facets of credibility. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to published replications in the psychology literature. Finally, we outline a Web implementation of the framework and conclude by encouraging the community of researchers to contribute to the development and crowdsourcing of this platform.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which there is no cure, is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Despite tremendous efforts by the scientific community, the AD drug development pipeline remains extremely limited. Animal models of disease are a cornerstone of any drug development program and should be as relevant as possible to the disease, recapitulating the disease phenotype with high fidelity, to meaningfully contribute to the development of a successful therapeutic agent. Over the past two decades, transgenic models of AD based on the known genetic origins of familial AD have significantly contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of the disease. These models were extensively used in AD drug development. The numerous reported failures of new treatments for AD in clinical trials indicate that the use of genetic models of AD may not represent the complete picture of AD in humans and that other types of animal models relevant to the sporadic form of the disease, which represents 95% of AD cases, should be developed. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of non-transgenic rat models of AD and how these models may open new avenues for drug development.

AB  - Given the important implications of social support on managing volunteers and their organizational commitment, we investigated how members of a Korean immigrant church (N = 178) exchanged two distinctive kinds of social support (i.e., informational and tangible). We used theories of centrality and homophily to hypothesize patterns of social connections among organizational members. Employing exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), the current study estimated the likelihood of age and gender homophily/heterophily in forming supportive ties while considering structural parameters. The results of analysis of variance showed that members with higher socioeconomic status and in official staff positions in the church were more central in the informational support exchange. However, ERGM for both types of support networks did not show hypothesized gender and age homophily/heterophily of Korean immigrants’ support exchange, suggesting the importance of other potential organizational and cultural influences. The findings shed light on the internal structuring of organizational support networks and suggest practical implications for managing organizational volunteers.

AB  - An amyloid protein that precipitates in the cerebral vessel walls of Dutch patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis is similar to the amyloid protein in vessel walls and senile plaques in brains of patients with Alzheimer&#039;s disease, Down syndrome, and sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cloning and sequencing of the two exons that encode the amyloid protein from two patients with this amyloidosis revealed a cytosine-to-guanine transversion, a mutation that caused a single amino acid substitution (glutamine instead of glutamic acid) at position 22 of the amyloid protein. The mutation may account for the deposition of this amyloid protein in the cerebral vessel walls of these patients, leading to cerebral hemorrhages and premature death.

AB  - Aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau are a defining feature of a group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies and are a hallmark lesion of Alzheimer disease.Tau exists as six major isoforms in the adult human brain and is subject to massive post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation and truncation.The advent of novel biomarkers such as PET tracers and the lower regulatory hurdles for treating rare forms of tauopathy, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, have facilitated clinical trials targeting tauopathies.Drug development has also been facilitated by transgenic animal models and by better insights into the physiological and pathological roles of tau and its different isoforms.An interesting new thread has been added to the field with the hypothesis that tau pathology propagates extracellularly.Some challenges faced in the treatment of tauopathies are specific to tau, whereas others, such as the presence of the blood–brain barrier, represent a general challenge in the treatment of diseases of the brain.Clinical trials targeting tau have included more than a dozen diverse (and not yet exhausted) strategies in recent years.

AB  - Background: The amount of published in vivo studies and the speed researchers are publishing them make it virtually impossible to follow the recent development in the field. Systematic review emerged as a method to summarise and analyse the studies quantitatively and critically but it is often out-of-date due to its lengthy process. Method: We invited five machine learning and text-mining groups to build classifiers for identifying publications relevant to neuropathic pain (33814 training publications). We kept 1188 publications for the assessment of the performance of different classifiers. Two groups participated in the next stage: testing their algorithm on datasets labeled for psychosis (11777/2944) and datasets labeled for Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis (train/text: 2038/510). Result: The performances (sensitive/specificity) of the most promising classifier built for neuropathic pain are: 95%/84%. The performance for psychosis and Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis datasets are 95%/73% and 100%/45%. Conclusions: Machine learning can significantly reduce the irrelevant publications in a systematic review, and save the scientists' time and money. Classifier algorithms built for one dataset can be reapplied on another dataset in different field. We are building a machine learning service at the back of Systematic Review & Meta-analysis Facility (SyRF).

AB  - Publisher Summary Currently available treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) provide only modest symptomatic relief; they do not stop disease progression, and despite government initiatives and a concerted effort from the pharmaceutical industry and academia to produce drugs that are more efficacious for the treatment of this disorder, some have argued that many of the treatments under development are not very innovative and may not be any more effective than existing treatments. The acknowledged limitations of existing pharmacological treatments for AD, combined with the lack of progress in discovering and developing new drugs, the apparent lack of predictive validity of the preclinical models, the lack of creativity and innovation and other inefficiencies in the system, contribute to a growing sense of urgency among all stakeholders, including patients and investors, who are beginning to demand that the field find more effective and efficient ways to develop novel treatments for AD. This chapter examines how preclinical behavioral models can be developed, validated, and used, to maximize their predictive validity and improve the productivity of the drug discovery process. It is written from the perspective of translational research, which involves interactions between scientists in academia and the biotech/pharmaceutical industry, working together with clinical scientists, to identify and validate the most appropriate models and endpoints in animals and humans, by which efficacy can be predicted and confirmed. The belief is that such a collaborative, integrated, translational approach, is both useful and necessary to be able to predict more accurately which treatments will ultimately prove to be truly effective, based on the results of preclinical models and early clinical trials.

AB  - Publisher Summary Currently available treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) provide only modest symptomatic relief; they do not stop disease progression, and despite government initiatives and a concerted effort from the pharmaceutical industry and academia to produce drugs that are more efficacious for the treatment of this disorder, some have argued that many of the treatments under development are not very innovative and may not be any more effective than existing treatments. The acknowledged limitations of existing pharmacological treatments for AD, combined with the lack of progress in discovering and developing new drugs, the apparent lack of predictive validity of the preclinical models, the lack of creativity and innovation and other inefficiencies in the system, contribute to a growing sense of urgency among all stakeholders, including patients and investors, who are beginning to demand that the field find more effective and efficient ways to develop novel treatments for AD. This chapter examines how preclinical behavioral models can be developed, validated, and used, to maximize their predictive validity and improve the productivity of the drug discovery process. It is written from the perspective of translational research, which involves interactions between scientists in academia and the biotech/pharmaceutical industry, working together with clinical scientists, to identify and validate the most appropriate models and endpoints in animals and humans, by which efficacy can be predicted and confirmed. The belief is that such a collaborative, integrated, translational approach, is both useful and necessary to be able to predict more accurately which treatments will ultimately prove to be truly effective, based on the results of preclinical models and early clinical trials.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss along with neuropsychiatric symptoms and a decline in activities of daily life. Its main pathological features are cerebral atrophy, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of patients. There are various descriptive hypotheses regarding the causes of AD, including the cholinergic hypothesis, amyloid hypothesis, tau propagation hypothesis, mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, calcium homeostasis hypothesis, neurovascular hypothesis, inflammatory hypothesis, metal ion hypothesis, and lymphatic system hypothesis. However, the ultimate etiology of AD remains obscure. In this review, we discuss the main hypotheses of AD and related clinical trials. Wealthy puzzles and lessons have made it possible to develop explanatory theories and identify potential strategies for therapeutic interventions for AD. The combination of hypometabolism and autophagy deficiency is likely to be a causative factor for AD. We further propose that fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has the potential to treat AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A continuous growth in the publication of research papers means that there is an expanding volume of data available to the systematic reviewer. Sometimes, researchers can become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data being processed, leading to inefficient data extraction. This paper seeks to address this problem by proposing a modification to the current systematic review methodology. PROPOSED METHOD: This paper details the routine piloting of a systematic review all the way through to evidence-synthesis stage using data from a sample of included papers. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The result of piloting a sample of papers through to evidence-synthesis stage is to produce a 'mini systematic review'. Insights from such a pilot review may be used to modify the criteria in the data extraction form. It is proposed that this approach will ensure that in the full review the most useful and relevant information is extracted from all the papers in one phase without needing to re-visit the individual papers at a later stage. CONCLUSIONS: Routine piloting in systematic reviews has been developed in response to advances in information technology and the subsequent increase in rapid access to clinical papers and data. It is proposed that the routine piloting of large systematic reviews will enable themes and meaning in the data to become apparent early in the review process. This, in turn, will facilitate the efficient extraction of data from all the papers in the full review. It is proposed that this approach will result in increased validity of the review, with potential benefits for increasing efficiency.

AB  - Summary Neuroinflammatory changes are a characteristic of several, if not all, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and are typified by increased microglial activation. Microglia express several receptors making them highly reactive and plastic cells, and, at least in vitro, they adopt different phenotypes in a manner analogous to their peripheral counterparts, macrophages. Microglia also express numerous cell surface proteins enabling them to interact with cells and the evidence indicates that maintenance of microglia in a quiescent state relies, at least to some extent, on an interaction with neurons by means of specific ligand–receptor pairs, for example CD200–CD200R. It is clear that microglia also interact with T cells and recent evidence indicates that co-incubation of microglia with T helper type 1 cells markedly increases their activation. Under normal conditions, small numbers of activated T cells gain entry to the brain and are involved in immune surveillance but infiltration of significant numbers of T cells occurs in disease and following injury. The consequences of T cell infiltration appear to depend on the conditions, with descriptions of both neurodestructive and neuroprotective effects in animal models of different diseases. This review will discuss the modulatory effect of T cells on microglia and the impact of infiltration of T cells into the brain with a focus on Alzheimer's disease, and will propose that infiltration of interferon-γ-producing cells may be an important factor in triggering inflammation that is pathogenic and destructive.

AB  - Development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been challenging with no drugs approved to date. The failures of several amyloid-targeted programs have led many to dismiss the amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis of AD. An antiamyloid antibody aducanumab recently showed modest but significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial providing important validation of amyloid as a therapeutic target. However the inconsistent results observed with aducanumab may be explained by the limited brain penetration and lack of selectivity for the soluble Aβ oligomers which are implicated as upstream drivers of neurodegeneration by multiple studies. Development of agents that can effectively inhibit Aβ oligomer formation or block their toxicity is therefore warranted. An ideal drug would cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently and achieve sustained brain levels that can continuously prevent oligomer formation or inhibit their toxicity. A late-stage candidate with these attributes is ALZ-801 an oral drug with a favorable safety profile and high brain penetration that can robustly inhibit Aβ oligomer formation. An upcoming phase 3 trial with ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 homozygous patients with early AD will effectively test this amyloid oligomer hypothesis.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder featuring hallmark Abeta plaques that spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Removal of these plaques has been a focal point of research toward developing treatments for AD and outcomes from multiple development programs support the prediction that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that reduce Abeta plaques meaningfully slow clinical decline in AD patients (e.g. aducanumab donanemab lecanemab). Donanemab which specifically targets pyroglutamate-modified Abeta was recently reported to reduce Alzheimer's-related cognitive decline in a phase 2 clinical trial. PRX012 is a high-potency IgG1 mAb targeting the N-terminus of Abeta with ~70pM affinity (KD) for Abeta fibrils. In the current study we assessed whether PRX012 an N-terminal Abeta targeting IgG1 antibody stimulates microglial-mediated clearance of Abeta species including pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (AbetapE3-42) in amyloid plaque-bearing AD brain tissue. Method(s): The impact of PRX012 and other Prothena N-terminal anti-Abeta antibodies on microglia-mediated phagocytic clearance of Abeta plaque species was assessed ex vivo using cryostat sections of human AD brain. Test antibodies or isotype control were applied to plaque-bearing AD tissue samples which were then incubated with murine microglia for 72 hours. Determination of total Abeta (Abeta1-42) and AbetapE3-42 levels were assessed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection and ELISA. Result(s): PRX012 and other Prothena N-terminal anti-Abeta antibodies promoted rapid and robust microglia-mediated clearance of Abeta species associated with plaques in human AD tissue. Compared to isotype control PRX012 significantly reduced both Abeta1-42 levels as well as pyroglutamate-modified Abeta species. Conclusion(s): PRX012 an N-terminal-targeted anti-Abeta antibody facilitated abundant microglia-mediated clearance of Abeta plaque species including pyroglutamate-modified Abeta in brain tissue from AD patients. These data support further development of PRX012 as a potential subcutaneous next-generation best-in-class Abeta immunotherapy for AD.Copyright © 2021 the Alzheimer's Association

AB  - Abstract Systematic reviews are an important method to support evidence‐based decisions in healthcare (research). Although not yet as common as clinical systematic reviews, the number of systematic reviews of animal studies has been increasing steadily in recent years. An important method to promote high‐quality systematic reviews is to pre‐specify the review methodology in a protocol, before the conduct of the systematic review itself. In contrast to clinical systematic reviews, a standard protocol format for systematic reviews of animal studies is not yet available. Here, we present a protocol format tailored to the preparation, registration and publication of systematic reviews of animal intervention studies (i.e. systematic reviews of animal experiments studying the efficacy and/or safety of interventions intended for use in human patients). In analogy to the Cochrane review protocol, the format helps authors predefine the methodological approach of their systematic review, from research question to data synthesis. We recommend that authors prospectively complete and agree on the protocol, and register and/or publish it to allow feedback on the proposed methodology and to avoid the introduction of bias during the review process. Opportunities for obtaining feedback, and for registration and publication of review protocols are also discussed.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Antibody-based immunotherapy against Abeta to trigger its clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we report the generation of aducanumab a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated Abeta. In a transgenic mouse model of AD aducanumab is shown to enter the brain bind parenchymal Abeta and reduce soluble and insoluble Abeta in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD one year of monthly intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain Abeta in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline measured by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials it would provide compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis.

AB  - The reliability of experimental findings depends on the rigour of experimental design. Here we show limited reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias in a random sample of life sciences publications, significantly lower reporting of randomisation in work published in journals of high impact, and very limited reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias in publications from leading United Kingdom institutions. Ascertainment of differences between institutions might serve both as a measure of research quality and as a tool for institutional efforts to improve research quality.

AB  - Background and Purpose—
              
              The extensive neuroprotective literature describing the efficacy of candidate drugs in focal ischemia has yet to lead to the development of effective stroke treatments. Ideally, the choice of drugs taken forward to clinical trial should be based on an unbiased assessment of all available data. Such an assessment might include not only the efficacy of a drug but also the in vivo characteristics and limits—in terms of time window, dose, species, and model of ischemia used—to that efficacy. To our knowledge, such assessments have not been made. Nicotinamide is a candidate neuroprotective drug with efficacy in experimental stroke, but the limits to and characteristics of that efficacy have not been fully described.
            
            
              
                Methods—
              
              Systematic review and modified meta-analysis of studies of experimental stroke describing the efficacy of nicotinamide. The search strategy ensured ascertainment of studies published in full and those published in abstract only. DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis was used to account for heterogeneity between studies.
            
            
              
                Results—
              
              Nicotinamide improved outcome by 0.287 (95% confidence interval 0.227 to 0.347); it was more effective in temporary ischemia models, after intravenous administration, in animals without comorbidities, and in studies published in full rather than in abstract. Studies scoring highly on a quality measure gave more precise estimates of the global effect.
            
            
              
                Conclusions—
              
              Meta-analysis provides an effective technique for the aggregation of data from experimental stroke studies. We propose new standards for reporting such studies and a systematic approach to aggregating data from the neuroprotective literature.

AB  - To define the neuropathologic findings in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer disease (EAD).The mean numbers of diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques (NPs), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in 4 neocortical regions and 4 ventromedial temporal lobe regions were counted in 10 patients with amnestic MCI and compared with the mean numbers in 23 normal control subjects and 10 patients with EAD, and then were compared with memory performance. All of the controls and patients were followed longitudinally.Patients with MCI showed no significant difference (P>.05) in the number of diffuse plaques from that in normal controls or patients with EAD. In patients with MCI, the number of NPs was significantly elevated in all 4 neocortical regions and amygdala compared with controls (P<.01 to <.001). There were no significant differences (P>.05) in the number of NPs between MCI and EAD cerebral cortex, but significant increases were present for NPs in EAD amygdala and subiculum compared with MCI (P<.01). In patients with MCI compared with controls, the only significant increase in NFTs in the neocortex was in the parietal lobe. However, the number of NFTs was significantly elevated in MCI in all 4 ventromedial temporal lobe structures compared with controls (P<.01 to <.001). In comparing MCI with EAD, there were significant increases in NFTs in EAD in frontal and temporal lobes, amygdala, and subiculum (P<.01). The numbers of NPs and NFTs were significantly elevated in all of the neocortical regions and ventromedial temporal lobe regions in patients with EAD compared with controls (P<.001). Memory function was significantly correlated with NFTs in CA1 of the hippocampus (P<.01) and the entorhinal cortex (P<.05).In patients with amnestic MCI who were followed longitudinally, the early changes of Alzheimer disease were present. The NFTs were slightly more prominent than β-amyloid peptide deposition in the progression from normal to MCI to EAD. Ventromedial temporal lobe NFTs probably represent the substrate for memory decline in MCI. From a neuropathologic perspective, it appears that amnestic MCI is, in reality, EAD.<!-- Arch Neurol. 2006;63:38-46 -->

AB  - Technologies and methods to speed up the production of systematic reviews by reducing the manual labour involved have recently emerged. Automation has been proposed or used to expedite most steps of the systematic review process, including search, screening, and data extraction. However, how these technologies work in practice and when (and when not) to use them is often not clear to practitioners. In this practical guide, we provide an overview of current machine learning methods that have been proposed to expedite evidence synthesis. We also offer guidance on which of these are ready for use, their strengths and weaknesses, and how a systematic review team might go about using them in practice.

AB  - Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RA) is an anti-inflammatory protein used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis and is considered a promising candidate therapy for stroke. Here, we sought to update the existing systematic review and meta-analysis of IL-1 RA in models of ischaemic stroke, published in 2009, to assess efficacy, the range of circumstances in which efficacy has been tested and whether the data appear to be confounded due to reported study quality and publication bias. We included 25 sources of data, 11 of which were additional to the original review. Overall, IL-1 RA reduced infarct volume by 36.2 % (95 % confidence interval 31.6–40.7, n = 76 comparisons from 1283 animals). Assessments for publication bias suggest 30 theoretically missing studies which reduce efficacy to 21.9 % (17.3–26.4). Efficacy was higher where IL-1 RA was administered directly into the ventricles rather than peripherally, and studies not reporting allocation concealment during the induction of ischaemia reported larger treatment effects. The preclinical data supporting IL-1 RA as a candidate therapy for ischaemic stroke have improved. The reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias has improved substantially in this update, and studies now include the use of animals with relevant co-morbidities.

AB  - Animal models have historically played a critical role in the exploration and characterization of disease pathophysiology, target identification, and in the in vivo evaluation of novel therapeutic agents and treatments. In the wake of numerous clinical trial failures of new chemical entities (NCEs) with promising preclinical profiles, animal models in all therapeutic areas have been increasingly criticized for their limited ability to predict NCE efficacy, safety and toxicity in humans. The present review discusses some of the challenges associated with the evaluation and predictive validation of animal models, as well as methodological flaws in both preclinical and clinical study designs that may contribute to the current translational failure rate. The testing of disease hypotheses and NCEs in multiple disease models necessitates evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships and the earlier development of validated disease-associated biomarkers to assess target engagement and NCE efficacy. Additionally, the transparent integration of efficacy and safety data derived from animal models into the hierarchical data sets generated preclinically is essential in order to derive a level of predictive utility consistent with the degree of validation and inherent limitations of current animal models. The predictive value of an animal model is thus only as useful as the context in which it is interpreted. Finally, rather than dismissing animal models as not very useful in the drug discovery process, additional resources, like those successfully used in the preclinical PK assessment used for the selection of lead NCEs, must be focused on improving existing and developing new animal models.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Much of the molecular understanding of synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) comes from studies of various mouse models that express familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations, often in combinations. Most studies compare the absolute magnitudes of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) to assess deficits in bidirectional synaptic plasticity accompanying FAD-linked mutations. However, LTP and LTD are not static, but their induction threshold is adjusted by overall neural activity via metaplasticity. Hence LTP/LTD changes in AD mouse models may reflect defects in metaplasticity processes. To determine this, we examined the LTP/LTD induction threshold in APPswe;PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (Tg) mice across two different ages. We found that in young Tg mice (1 month), LTP is enhanced at the expense of LTD, but in adults (6 months), the phenotype is reversed to promote LTD and reduce LTP, compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. The apparent opposite phenotype across age was due to an initial offset in the induction threshold to favor LTP and the inability to undergo developmental metaplasticity in Tg mice. In WTs, the synaptic modification threshold decreased over development to favor LTP and diminish LTD in adults. However, in Tg mice, the magnitudes of LTP and LTD stayed constant across development. The initial offset in LTP/LTD threshold in young Tg mice did not accompany changes in the LTP/LTD induction mechanisms, but altered AMPA receptor phosphorylation and appearance of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. We propose that the main synaptic defect in AD mouse models is due to their inability to undergo developmental metaplasticity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work offers a new insight that metaplasticity defects are central to synaptic dysfunctions seen in AD mouse models. In particular, we demonstrate that the apparent differences in LTP/LTD magnitude seen across ages in AD transgenic mouse models reflect the inability to undergo a normal developmental shift in metaplasticity.

AB  - Background
              Improving rigor and transparency measures should lead to improvements in reproducibility across the scientific literature; however, the assessment of measures of transparency tends to be very difficult if performed manually.
            
            
              Objective
              This study addresses the enhancement of the Rigor and Transparency Index (RTI, version 2.0), which attempts to automatically assess the rigor and transparency of journals, institutions, and countries using manuscripts scored on criteria found in reproducibility guidelines (eg, Materials Design, Analysis, and Reporting checklist criteria).
            
            
              Methods
              The RTI tracks 27 entity types using natural language processing techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Conditional Random Field–based models and regular expressions; this allowed us to assess over 2 million papers accessed through PubMed Central.
            
            
              Results
              Between 1997 and 2020 (where data were readily available in our data set), rigor and transparency measures showed general improvement (RTI 2.29 to 4.13), suggesting that authors are taking the need for improved reporting seriously. The top-scoring journals in 2020 were the Journal of Neurochemistry (6.23), British Journal of Pharmacology (6.07), and Nature Neuroscience (5.93). We extracted the institution and country of origin from the author affiliations to expand our analysis beyond journals. Among institutions publishing >1000 papers in 2020 (in the PubMed Central open access set), Capital Medical University (4.75), Yonsei University (4.58), and University of Copenhagen (4.53) were the top performers in terms of RTI. In country-level performance, we found that Ethiopia and Norway consistently topped the RTI charts of countries with 100 or more papers per year. In addition, we tested our assumption that the RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability (ie, a high RTI represents papers containing sufficient information for replication efforts). Using work by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we determined that replication papers (RTI 7.61, SD 0.78) scored significantly higher (P<.001) than the original papers (RTI 3.39, SD 1.12), which according to the project required additional information from authors to begin replication efforts.
            
            
              Conclusions
              These results align with our view that RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability. Unfortunately, RTI measures for journals, institutions, and countries fall short of the replicated paper average. If we consider the RTI of these replication studies as a target for future manuscripts, more work will be needed to ensure that the average manuscript contains sufficient information for replication attempts.

AB  - SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementing disorder of aging, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Two of the common clinical features of AD are progressive cognitive and functional impairment, and disturbed sleep/wake patterns. We examined sleep/wake patterns and cognitive and functional status measures in a large sample of AD subjects ranging from mild to moderate-severe in impairment. All subjects survived at least 2 years after initial diagnosis. Regression analyses revealed that sleep/wake variables were highly correlated with and explained significant variance in cognitive and functional measures. More wakefulness during the night and longer REM latencies were associated with impaired cognition and function while more REM and slow-wave sleep were associated with preserved cognition and function. These results indicate that with advancing severity of the disease, sleep/wake patterns are disrupted in parallel with the disturbances in cognition and function that are the hallmarks of AD. Further, they suggest that the neural substrates underlying each process degenerate at somewhat comparable rates.

AB  - Rodent defense behavior assays have been widely used as preclinical models of anxiety to study possibly therapeutic anxiety-reducing interventions. However, some proposed anxiety-modulating factors ⿿ genes, drugs and stressors ⿿ have had discordant effects across different studies. To reconcile the effect sizes of purported anxiety factors, we conducted systematic review and meta-analyses of the literature on ten anxiety-linked interventions, as examined in the elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box assays. Diazepam, 5-HT1A receptor gene knockout and overexpression, SERT gene knockout and overexpression, pain, restraint, social isolation, corticotropin-releasing hormone and Crhr1 were selected for review. Eight interventions had statistically significant effects on rodent anxiety, while Htr1a overexpression and Crh knockout did not. Evidence for publication bias was found in the diazepam, Htt knockout, and social isolation literatures. The Htr1a and Crhr1 results indicate a disconnect between preclinical science and clinical research. Furthermore, the meta-analytic data confirmed that genetic SERT anxiety effects were paradoxical in the context of the clinical use of SERT inhibitors to reduce anxiety.

AB  - Systematic reviews should build on a protocol that describes the rationale, hypothesis, and planned methods of the review; few reviews report whether a protocol exists. Detailed, well-described protocols can facilitate the understanding and appraisal of the review methods, as well as the detection of modifications to methods and selective reporting in completed reviews. We describe the development of a reporting guideline, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015). PRISMA-P consists of a 17-item checklist intended to facilitate the preparation and reporting of a robust protocol for the systematic review. Funders and those commissioning reviews might consider mandating the use of the checklist to facilitate the submission of relevant protocol information in funding applications. Similarly, peer reviewers and editors can use the guidance to gauge the completeness and transparency of a systematic review protocol submitted for publication in a journal or other medium.

AB  - Background and purpose To determine the prevalence of sleep disturbance in a memory clinic population of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and identify its clinical correlates. Patients and methods Data from 215 attendees at a memory clinic, who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, were examined. This included data from cognitive, functional and neuropsychological assessments. Sleep disturbance was determined using the question about diurnal rhythm disturbance on the BEHAVE-AD questionnaire. Two groups, with and without sleep disturbance, were compared. Group differences were analysed using univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results The prevalence of sleep disturbance in this sample was 24.5%. The BEHAVE-AD ‘aggressiveness’ (P=0.009) and ‘global rating’ (P=0.029) (a measure of global impact of behavioural disturbance) were found to be significant predictors of sleep disturbance in AD. Conclusions Sleep disturbance in AD is associated with other behavioural symptoms, notably aggressiveness. Sleep disturbance in AD has significant impact on the patient and/or caregiver. Consideration of co-morbid behavioural symptoms may aid the clinician in choosing a suitable treatment for sleep disturbance in AD.

AB  - Background Systematic reviews of preclinical studies, in vivo animal experiments in particular, can influence clinical research and thus even clinical care. Dissemination bias, selective dissemination of positive or significant results, is one of the major threats to validity in systematic reviews also in the realm of animal studies. We conducted a systematic review to determine the number of published systematic reviews of animal studies until present, to investigate their methodological features especially with respect to assessment of dissemination bias, and to investigate the citation of preclinical systematic reviews on clinical research. Methods Eligible studies for this systematic review constitute systematic reviews that summarize in vivo animal experiments whose results could be interpreted as applicable to clinical care. We systematically searched Ovid Medline, Embase, ToxNet, and ScienceDirect from 1st January 2009 to 9th January 2013 for eligible systematic reviews without language restrictions. Furthermore we included articles from two previous systematic reviews by Peters et al. and Korevaar et al. Results The literature search and screening process resulted in 512 included full text articles. We found an increasing number of published preclinical systematic reviews over time. The methodological quality of preclinical systematic reviews was low. The majority of preclinical systematic reviews did not assess methodological quality of the included studies (71%), nor did they assess heterogeneity (81%) or dissemination bias (87%). Statistics quantifying the importance of clinical research citing systematic reviews of animal studies showed that clinical studies referred to the preclinical research mainly to justify their study or a future study (76%). Discussion Preclinical systematic reviews may have an influence on clinical research but their methodological quality frequently remains low. Therefore, systematic reviews of animal research should be critically appraised before translating them to a clinical context.

AB  - Mutations at codon 717 in exon 17 of the β–amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have previously been shown to segregate with early onset Alzheimer's disease in some families. We have identified a double mutation at codons 670 and 671 (APP 770 transcript) in exon 16 which co–segregates with the disease in two large (probably related) early–onset Alzheimer's disease families from Sweden. Two base pair transversions (G to T, A to C) from the normal sequence predict Lys to Asn and Met to Leu amino acid substitutions at codons 670 and 671 of the APP transcript. This mutation occurs at the amino terminal of β–amyloid and may be pathogenic because it occurs at or close to the endosomal/lysosomal cleavage site of the molecule. Thus, pathogenic mutations in APP frame the β–amyloid sequence.

AB  - The worldwide incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing with estimates that 115 million individuals will have AD by 2050, creating an unsustainable healthcare challenge due to a lack of effective treatment options highlighted by multiple clinical failures of agents designed to reduce the brain amyloid burden considered synonymous with the disease. The amyloid hypothesis that has been the overarching focus of AD research efforts for more than two decades has been questioned in terms of its causality but has not been unequivocally disproven despite multiple clinical failures, This is due to issues related to the quality of compounds advanced to late stage clinical trials and the lack of validated biomarkers that allow the recruitment of AD patients into trials before they are at a sufficiently advanced stage in the disease where therapeutic intervention is deemed futile. Pursuit of a linear, reductionistic amyloidocentric approach to AD research, which some have compared to a religious faith, has resulted in other, equally plausible but as yet unvalidated AD hypotheses being underfunded leading to a disastrous roadblock in the search for urgently needed AD therapeutics. Genetic evidence supporting amyloid causality in AD is reviewed in the context of the clinical failures, and progress in tau-based and alternative approaches to AD, where an evolving modus operandi in biomedical research fosters excessive optimism and a preoccupation with unproven, and often ephemeral, biomarker/genome-based approaches that override transparency, objectivity and data-driven decision making, resulting in low probability environments where data are subordinate to self propagating hypotheses.

AB  - Abstract The only drugs currently approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the NMDA antagonist memantine. Apart from these drugs, which have minimal to no clinical benefit, the 40-year search for effective therapeutics to treat AD has resulted in a clinical failure rate of 100% not only for compounds that prevent brain amyloid deposition or remove existing amyloid plaques but also those acting by a variety of other putative disease-associated mechanisms. This indicates that the preclinical data generated from current AD targets to support the selection, optimization, and translation of new chemical entities (NCEs) and biologics to clinical trials is seriously compromised. While many of these failures reflect flawed hypotheses or a lack of adequate characterization of the preclinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PD/PK) properties of lead NCEs—including their bioavailability and toxicity—the conceptualization, validation, and interrogation of the current animal models of AD represent key limitations. The overwhelming majority of these AD models are transgenic, based on aspects of the amyloid hypothesis and the genetics of the familial form of the disease. As a result, these generally lack construct and predictive validity for the sporadic form of the human disease. The 170 or so transgenic models, perhaps the largest number ever focused on a single disease, use rodents, mainly mice, and in addition to amyloid also address aspects of tau causality with more complex multigene models including other presumed causative factors together with amyloid. This overview discusses the current animal models of AD in the context of both the controversies surrounding the causative role of amyloid in the disease and the need to develop validated models of cognitive function/dysfunction that more appropriately reflect the phenotype(s) of human aged-related dementias. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - ▪ Abstract  The systematic review “movement” that has transformed medical journal reports of clinical trials and reviews of clinical trials has taken hold in public health, with the most recent milestone, the publication of the first edition of The Guide to Community Health Services in 2005. In this paper we define and distinguish current terms, point out important resources for systematic reviews, describe the impact of systematic review on the quality of primary studies and summaries of the evidence, and provide perspectives on the promise of systematic reviews for shaping the agenda for public health research. Several pitfalls are discussed, including a false sense of rigor implied by the terms “systematic review” and “meta-analysis” and substantial variation in the validity of claims that a particular intervention is “evidence based,” and the difficulty of translating conclusions from systematic reviews into public health advocacy and practice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a form of localized amyloidosis characterized by cerebral cortical amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid deposits within the walls of leptomeningeal vessels. Although most cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, kindreds with autosomal-dominant inheritance of the syndrome suggest that a single mutation may be important in pathogenesis. Direct sequencing of DNA from a family with autopsy-proven Alzheimer's disease revealed a single amino acid substitution (Phe for Val) in the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein. This mutation correlates with the presence of Alzheimer's disease in all patients in this study, and may be the inherited factor causing both amyloid fibril formation and dementia.

AB  - Abstract This review describes several transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive cognitive decline and is diagnosed postmortem by the presence of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal tau neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. Currently there is no intervention that cures, prevents, or even slows disease progression. Its complex etiology and pathology pose significant challenges for animal model development, and there is no single model that faithfully recapitulates both the pathological aspects and behavioral phenotypes of AD. Nearly 200 transgenic rodent models of AD have been generated primarily based on mutations linked to Aβ protein misprocessing in the familial form of the disease. More recent models incorporate mutations in tau protein, as well as mutations associated with the sporadic form of the disease. The salient features, strengths, limitations, and key differentiators for the most commonly used and best characterized of these models are considered here. While the translational utility of many of these models to assess the potential of novel therapeutics is in dispute, knowledge of the different models available and a detailed understanding of their features can aid in the selection of the optimal model to explore disease mechanisms or evaluate candidate medications. We comment on the predictive utility of these models considering recent clinical trial failures and discuss trends and future directions in the development of models for AD based on the plethora of clinical data that have been generated over the last decade. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (A beta) deposits are a relatively late consequence of A beta aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. When pathogenic A beta seeds begin to form propagate and spread is not known nor are they biochemically defined. We tested various antibodies for their ability to neutralize A beta seeds before A beta deposition becomes detectable in A beta precursor protein-transgenic mice. We also characterized the different antibody recognition profiles using immunoprecipitation of size-fractionated native mouse and human brain-derived A beta assemblies. At least one antibody aducanumab after acute administration at the pre-amyloid stage led to a significant reduction of A beta deposition and downstream pathologies 6 months later. This demonstrates that therapeutically targetable pathogenic A beta seeds already exist during the lag phase of protein aggregation in the brain. Thus the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease-currently defined as A beta deposition without clinical symptoms-may be a relatively late manifestation of a much earlier pathogenic seed formation and propagation that currently escapes detection in vivo. Uhlmann et al. show that the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease may in fact be a relatively late manifestation of a much earlier pathogenic and targetable process of seed formation and propagation.

AB  - Context Many Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) were performed in the recent past, but just a few are being updated. Keeping SLRs updated is essential to prolong their lifespan. Objective To give a picture about how SLRs are being updated and what researchers think about SLRs updates. Method In this work, we present a Systematic Mapping (SM) study about SLRs updates and a survey with EBSE researchers that published their SLRs between 2011 and 2015. Results We included 22 studies in the SM, where 15 changed some artifact from the original study, including changes in research questions. We obtained 28 answers in our survey with SLRs authors that, in general, consolidate interpretations retrieved from the SM, but some answers did not. Conclusion SLRs may lose their impact over the years. Identifying actions to keep them updated is of great importance to SLR research field.

AB  - Two facts about the hippocampus have been common currency among neuroscientists for several decades. First, lesions of the hippocampus in humans prevent the acquisition of new episodic memories; second, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is a prominent feature of hippocampal synapses. Given this background, the hypothesis that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated, at least in part, by hippocampal synaptic plasticity has seemed as cogent in theory as it has been difficult to prove in practice. Here we argue that the recent development of transgenic molecular devices will encourage a shift from mechanistic investigations of synaptic plasticity in single neurons towards an analysis of how networks of neurons encode and represent memory, and we suggest ways in which this might be achieved. In the process, the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity is necessary and sufficient for information storage in the brain may finally be validated.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer’s disease is a major and increasing burden on families, communities, and national health budgets. Despite intensive and extended research there is still widespread debate about its cause(s) and no effective treatments exist. Familial (inherited, mainly early onset) and sporadic (mainly late onset) forms of the disease exist and it is uncertain to what extent they are related. Transgenic mouse models have dominated the investigation of this disease but their validity can be questioned. Numerous alternative models exist that can provide valuable information on the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer’s disease. In this chapter we review the various invertebrate, nonmammalian vertebrate, and mammalian models and how these have been used to investigate this disease. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of these various model systems. Of course, animal models never completely reflect the true nature of a human disease but progress in understanding and finding preventative and ameliorative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease is hindered by the lack of a convincing hypothesis for the cause of this complex condition.

AB  - Science is facing a “replication crisis” in which many experimental findings cannot be replicated and are likely to be false. Does this imply that many scientific facts are false as well? To find out, we explore the process by which a claim becomes fact. We model the community’s confidence in a claim as a Markov process with successive published results shifting the degree of belief. Publication bias in favor of positive findings influences the distribution of published results. We find that unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, false claims frequently can become canonized as fact. Data-dredging, p-hacking, and similar behaviors exacerbate the problem. Should negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims would be more readily distinguished. To the degree that the model reflects the real world, there may be serious concerns about the validity of purported facts in some disciplines.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by the accumulation of the ?-amyloid peptide (A?) within the brain along with hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Genetic, biochemical, and behavioral research suggest that physiologic generation of the neurotoxic A? peptide from sequential amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is the crucial step in the development of AD. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain and metabolized in a rapid and highly complex fashion by a series of sequential proteases, including the intramembranous ?-secretase complex, which also process other key regulatory molecules. Why A? accumulates in the brains of elderly individuals is unclear but could relate to changes in APP metabolism or A? elimination. Lessons learned from biochemical and genetic studies of APP processing will be crucial to the development of therapeutic targets to treat AD.

AB  - The fourth meeting of the International Collaboration for Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR) was held 5–6 November 2019 in The Hague, the Netherlands. ICASR is an interdisciplinary group whose goal is to maximize the use of technology for conducting rapid, accurate, and efficient systematic reviews of scientific evidence. The group seeks to facilitate the development and acceptance of automated techniques for systematic reviews. In 2018, the major themes discussed were the transferability of automation tools (i.e., tools developed for other purposes that might be used by systematic reviewers), the automated recognition of study design in multiple disciplines and applications, and approaches for the evaluation of automation tools.

AB  - The third meeting of the International Collaboration for Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR) was held 17–18 October 2017 in London, England. ICASR is an interdisciplinary group whose goal is to maximize the use of technology for conducting rapid, accurate, and efficient systematic reviews of scientific evidence. The group seeks to facilitate the development and widespread acceptance of automated techniques for systematic reviews. The meeting’s conclusion was that the most pressing needs at present are to develop approaches for validating currently available tools and to provide increased access to curated corpora that can be used for validation. To that end, ICASR’s short-term goals in 2018–2019 are to propose and publish protocols for key tasks in systematic reviews and to develop an approach for sharing curated corpora for validating the automation of the key tasks.

AB  - Several monoclonal antibodies targeting Abeta have been or are currently being tested in clinical trials as potential treatments for Alzheimer's Disease. Although these antibodies are often grouped together in the "passive immunotherapy" category they possess their own biophysical properties and most of them can be clearly differentiated. The clinical relevance of these differences remains to be established and the optimal profile for an anti-Abeta antibody to be both efficacious and safe remains to be defined.Extensive in vitro characterization has shown that anti-Abeta antibodies display different binding mode to the Abeta peptide and subsequently different binding specificity towards polymorphic variants of Abeta. For example the binding mode of aducanumab and the antigen-antibody interface has been shown to be unique compared to known Abeta monoclonal antibodies. In vivo investigations in transgenic model have shown brain penetration and binding to the amyloid deposits present in the brain and have also hinted to the potential mechanisms of action leading to the clearance of amyloid plaques. While several of the anti-Abeta clinical candidates are currently being evaluated in phase II/III trials preclinical research continues its evaluation in order to better understand the required attributes for the optimal antibody both in terms of efficacy and safety.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides is considered to be the primary mechanism of AD pathogenesis. This amyloid hypothesis is supported by the recent success of the human anti-amyloid antibody aducanumab in clearing plaque and slowing clinical impairment in prodromal or mild patients in a phase Ib trial. Here a peptide combining polyarginines (polyR) (for charge repulsion) and a segment derived from the core region of A beta amyloid (for sequence recognition) was designed. The efficacy of the designed peptide R-8-A beta(25-35) on amyloid reduction and the improvement of cognitive functions were evaluated using APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. Daily intranasal administration of PEI-conjugated R-8-A beta(25-35) peptide significantly reduced A beta amyloid accumulation and ameliorated the memory deficits of the transgenic mice. Intranasal administration is a feasible route for peptide delivery. The modular design combining polyR and aggregate-forming segments produced a desirable therapeutic effect and could be easily adopted to design therapeutic peptides for other proteinaceous aggregate-associated diseases.

AB  - Summary Neural network dysfunction may play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuronal circuits vulnerable to AD are also affected in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. hAPP mice with high levels of amyloid-β peptides in the brain develop AD-like abnormalities, including cognitive deficits and depletions of calcium-related proteins in the dentate gyrus, a region critically involved in learning and memory. Here, we report that hAPP mice have spontaneous nonconvulsive seizure activity in cortical and hippocampal networks, which is associated with GABAergic sprouting, enhanced synaptic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity deficits in the dentate gyrus. Many Aβ-induced neuronal alterations could be simulated in nontransgenic mice by excitotoxin challenge and prevented in hAPP mice by blocking overexcitation. Aberrant increases in network excitability and compensatory inhibitory mechanisms in the hippocampus may contribute to Aβ-induced neurological deficits in hAPP mice and, possibly, also in humans with AD.

AB  - At the 2015 REWARD/EQUATOR conference on research waste, the late Doug Altman revealed that his only regret about his 1994 BMJ paper ‘The scandal of poor medical research’ was that he used the word ‘poor’ rather than ‘bad’. But how much research is bad? And what would improve things?

AB  - Late-stage neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are β-amyloid (βA) and hyperphosphorylated tau peptides, aggregated into plaques and tangles, respectively. Corresponding phenotypes have been mimicked in existing transgenic mice, however, the translational value of aggressive over-expression has recently been questioned. As controlled gene expression may offer animal models with better predictive validity, we set out to design a transgenic mouse model that circumvents complications arising from pronuclear injection and massive over-expression, by targeted insertion of human mutated amyloid and tau transgenes, under the forebrain- and neurone-specific CaMKIIα promoter, termed PLB1Double. Crossing with an existing presenilin 1 line resulted in PLB1Triple mice. PLB1Triple mice presented with stable gene expression and age-related pathology of intra-neuronal amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau in hippocampus and cortex from 6 months onwards. At this early stage, pre-clinical 18FDG PET/CT imaging revealed cortical hypometabolism with increased metabolic activity in basal forebrain and ventral midbrain. Quantitative EEG analyses yielded heightened delta power during wakefulness and REM sleep, and time in wakefulness was already reliably enhanced at 6 months of age. These anomalies were paralleled by impairments in long-term and short-term hippocampal plasticity and preceded cognitive deficits in recognition memory, spatial learning, and sleep fragmentation all emerging at ∼12 months. These data suggest that prodromal AD phenotypes can be successfully modelled in transgenic mice devoid of fibrillary plaque or tangle development. PLB1Triple mice progress from a mild (MCI-like) state to a more comprehensive AD-relevant phenotype, which are accessible using translational tools such as wireless EEG and microPET/CT.

AB  - Analogous behavioral assays are needed across animal models and human patients to improve translational research. Here, we examined the extent to which performance in the Morris water maze — the most frequently used behavioral assay of spatial learning and memory in rodents — translates to humans. We designed a virtual version of the assay for human subjects that includes the visible-target training, hidden-target learning, and probe trials that are typically administered in the mouse version. We compared transgenic mice that express human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease (MCI-AD) to evaluate the sensitivity of performance measures in detecting deficits. Patients performed normally during visible-target training, while hAPP mice showed procedural learning deficits. In hidden-target learning and probe trials, hAPP mice and MCI-AD patients showed similar deficits in learning and remembering the target location. In addition, we have provided recommendations for selecting performance measures and sample sizes to make these assays sensitive to learning and memory deficits in humans with MCI-AD and in mouse models. Together, our results demonstrate that with careful study design and analysis, the Morris maze is a sensitive assay for detecting AD-relevant impairments across species.

AB  - In people with schizophrenia, cognitive abilities - including memory - are strongly associated with functional outcome. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of neuroplasticity that is believed to be the physiological basis for memory. It has been postulated that antipsychotic medication can impair long-term potentiation and cognition by altering dopaminergic transmission. Thus, a systematic review was performed in order to assess the relationship between antipsychotics and D2 antagonists on long-term potentiation. The majority of studies on LTP and antipsychotics have found that acute administration of antipsychotics was associated with impairments in LTP in wild-type animals. In contrast, chronic administration and acute antipsychotics in animal models of schizophrenia were not. Typical and atypical antipsychotics and other D2 antagonists behaved similarly, with the exception of clozapine and olanzapine. Clozapine caused potentiation independent of tetanization, while olanzapine facilitated tetanus-induced potentiation. These studies are limited in their ability to model the effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia as they were largely performed in wild-type animals as opposed to humans with schizophrenia, and assessed after acute rather than chronic treatment. Further studies using patients with schizophrenia receiving chronic antipsychotic treatment are needed to better understand the effects of these medications in this population.

AB  - The open field is a very popular animal model of anxiety-like behavior. An overview of the literature on the action elicited by effective or putative anxiolytics in animal subjected to this procedure indicates that classical treatments such as benzodiazepine receptor full agonists or 5-HT1A receptor full or partial agonists elicit an anxiolytic-like effect in this procedure in most cases (approximately 2/3). However, compounds (triazolobenzodiazepines such as adinazolam and alprazolam, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that have a different spectrum of therapeutic efficacy in anxiety disorders such as panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder were poorly effective as anxiolytics in the open field test, suggesting that this paradigm may not model features of anxiety disorders. The procedure is also relevant for the study of compounds endowed with anxiogenic effects, as such effects were detected after treatments with benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists or with corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor agonists.

AB  - Efforts over the past two decades to develop effective disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease have been disappointing, while parallel efforts in another chronic neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, have been remarkably productive. In an effort to advance development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, these two fields are contrasted in terms of the utility of animal models, definition of study populations, and utility of biomarkers. Possible solutions are suggested, and the review concludes with description of some active peer-reviewed, publicly funded clinical studies which address some of the identified weaknesses in past clinical trials for age-related dementia.

AB  - Background: A major challenge in treating brain diseases is presented by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that constitutes an efficient barrier not only for toxins but also a wide range of therapeutic agents (12). In overcoming this impediment ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (used as contrast agents in a clinical setting) has emerged as a powerful technology that allows for the selective brain uptake of therapeutic agents and blood-borne factors by transiently opening the blood-brain barrier (1). We have shown previously that ultrasound in combination with microbubbles but in the absence of a therapeutic agent can clear protein aggregates that constitute the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta (Abeta) in APP23 mice and Tau in pR5 mice (345). We have also shown that therapeutic ultrasound can be used as a general drug delivery tool as demonstrated by a 10-fold increased uptake of a single chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) targeting the 2N isoform of Tau (4). We have further obtained safety and efficacy data in both mice and sheep (6) allowing us to move towards a phase 1 clinical trial using a custom-made therapeutic ultrasound probe. Of note a recent trial proved safety of ultrasound-mediated BBB opening in five patients with early to moderate AD (7) and another trial in patients with glioblastomas revealed that even implanted transducers were well tolerated by the patients without inducing neurotoxicity (8). Objective(s): (i) To prepare a phase 1 clinical trial using ultrasound in combination with microbubbles in a small cohort of early-stage AD patients (MMSE >25). (ii) To evaluate the potential of ultrasound to achieve improved outcomes of the anti-Abeta antibody Aducanumab in APP23 mice. Method(s): (i) To resolve which ultrasound parameters result in safe and efficacious opening of the BBB we tested a matrix of ultrasound parameters (frequency acoustic pressure pulse length pulse repetition frequency and sonication duration) in mice using a single element probe. We further conducted sonications in sheep using a subset of these parameters factoring in the attenuation of the sheep skull. We optimized the sonication work-flow in sheep. (ii) We have previously shown that ultrasound on its own after 5-8 weekly treatment sessions clears Abeta effectively and restores memory functions (3). To determine whether ultrasound would also facilitate the uptake and efficacy of the anti-Abeta antibody Aducanumab we treated APP23 mice between 13 and 22 months of age monthly and compared the effects of Aducanumab with ultrasound and with combined treatments. Result(s): (i) We established a safe range of ultrasound parameters in mice and sheep. We successfully validated our custom-made probe demonstrating safe and efficacious BBB opening in sheep and establishing a treatment workflow in sheep assisted by pre-treatment planning. (ii) Ultrasound-mediated BBB opening significantly increases Aducanumab uptake by the brain (using fluorescently labeled Aducanumab). We further found significant reductions in amyloid pathology in the combination treatment compared to either delivering Aducanumab on its own or using ultrasound on its own. Conclusion(s): Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of microbubble-assisted ultrasound treatments as a new treatment modality for AD and other brain diseases. Ultrasound presents a cost-effective strategy in the context of using therapeutic antibodies to treat diseases of the brain.

AB  - Background: Advances in the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that pathogenesis is not directly related to plaque burden but rather to soluble toxic amyloid-beta oligomers (AsO). Therapeutic antibodies targeting As monomers and/or plaque have shown limited efficacy and dose-limiting adverse events in clinical trials. These findings suggest that antibodies capable of selectively neutralizing toxic AsO may achieve improved efficacy and safety. To this end we generated a monoclonal antibody PMN310 against a conformational As epitope predicted by computational modeling to be exposed on toxic AsO but not monomers or fibrils. Method(s): The binding profile of PMN310 was characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Its ability to neutralize the propagation and toxicity of AsO was assessed in vitro in a thioflavin-T propagation assay and in cultures of primary rodent neurons respectively. Protection against memory loss was tested in wild-type mice injected intracerebroventricularly with AsO. Brain exposure and kinetics were evaluated in aged wild-type mice and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Result(s): SPR analysis showed preferential binding of PMN310 to synthetic Ab oligomers vs monomers. Testing of soluble human AD brain extracts fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography consistently showed greater binding of PMN310 to the toxic oligomer-enriched low molecular weight fraction (<70 kDa) compared to aducanumab and bapineuzumab. IHC on frozen human AD brain sections showed no immunoreactivity of PMN310 with As deposits. In contrast clear binding of parenchymal and vascular As was observed with aducanumab and bapineuzumab consistent with the clinical occurrence of ARIA associated with these antibodies. In in vitro activity assays PMN310 inhibited AsO propagation and neuronal toxicity. In vivo PMN310 prevented AsO-induced loss of memory formation and reduced synaptic loss and inflammation. Systemic administration of PMN310 in mice resulted in brain exposure and kinetics comparable to those of other therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies. Conclusion(s): The greater selectivity of PMN310 for AsO and the potential to safely administer high doses with a reduced risk of ARIA suggest that it is likely to achieve greater therapeutic potency compared to other As-directed antibodies. Humanized PMN310 is currently in advanced preclinical development.Copyright © 2019

AB  - BACKGROUND: The annual incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the United States is over 2.5 million with approximately 3-5 million people living with chronic sequelae. Compared with moderate-severe TBI the long-term effects of mild TBI (mTBI) are less understood but important to address particularly for contact sport athletes and military personnel who have high mTBI exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the behavioural and neuropathological phenotypes induced by the Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) model of mTBI in both wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice up to 8 months post-injury. METHODS: Male WT and APP/PS1 littermates were randomized to sham or repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI; 2 × 0.5 J impacts 24 h apart) groups at 5.7 months of age. Animals were assessed up to 8 months post-injury for acute neurological deficits using the loss of righting reflex (LRR) and Neurological Severity Score (NSS) tasks and chronic behavioural changes using the passive avoidance (PA) Barnes maze (BM) elevated plus maze (EPM) and rotarod (RR) tasks. Neuropathological assessments included white matter damage; grey matter inflammation; and measures of Aβ levels deposition and aducanumab binding activity. RESULTS: The very mild CHIMERA rmTBI conditions used here produced no significant acute neurological or motor deficits in WT and APP/PS1 mice but they profoundly inhibited extinction of fear memory specifically in APP/PS1 mice over the 8-month assessment period. Spatial learning and memory were affected by both injury and genotype. Anxiety and risk-taking behaviour were affected by injury but not genotype. CHIMERA rmTBI induced chronic white matter microgliosis axonal injury and astrogliosis independent of genotype in the optic tract but not the corpus callosum and it altered microgliosis in APP/PS1 amygdala and hippocampus. Finally rmTBI did not alter long-term tau Aβ or amyloid levels but it increased aducanumab binding activity. CONCLUSIONS: CHIMERA is a useful model to investigate the chronic consequences of rmTBI including behavioural abnormalities consistent with features of post-traumatic stress disorder and inflammation of both white and grey matter. The presence of human Aβ greatly modified extinction of fear memory after rmTBI.

AB  - The lifespan of mice shows genotype, sex and laboratory effects, but little is known about genotype or sex differences in life expectancy of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper examines the lifespan of males and females of different mouse models of AD and their wildtype strains. Genotype and sex dependent differences in longevity have important implications for designing experiments with Alzheimer's mouse models, comparing genotype and sex differences in aging mouse models, designing drug treatment regimes and the translation of mouse data to human clinical studies. We conclude that the concept of aging and age-related disorders in mice must be reconsidered based on genotype and sex differences in mouse life expectancy data. Use of concepts such as relative age, prospective lifespan and proportion of lifespan remaining should be included in studies of age-related changes in mouse brains and behavior. Finally, measures such as the Frailty Index, which is independent of chronological age might be used to determine a common scale of aging for all mouse strains.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is a growing public health problem and still lacks effective treatments. Recent evidence suggests that microtubule-associated protein tau may mediate amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) toxicity by modulating the tyrosine kinase Fyn.Weshowed previously that tau reduction prevents, and Fyn overexpression exacerbates, cognitive deficits in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice overexpressing Aβ. However, the mechanisms by which Aβ, tau, and Fyn cooperate in AD-related pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. Here we examined the synaptic and network effects of this pathogenic triad. Tau reduction prevented cognitive decline induced by synergistic effects of Aβ and Fyn. Tau reduction also prevented synaptic transmission and plasticity deficits in hAPP mice. Using electroencephalography to examine network effects, we found that tau reduction prevented spontaneous epileptiform activity in multiple lines of hAPP mice. Tau reduction also reduced the severity of spontaneous and chemically induced seizures in mice overexpressing both Aβ and Fyn. To better understand these protective effects, we recorded whole cell currents in acute hippocampal slices from hAPP mice with and without tau. hAPP mice with tau had increased spontaneous and evoked excitatory currents, reduced inhibitory currents, and NMDA receptor dysfunction. Tau reduction increased inhibitory currents and normalized excitation/inhibition balance and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in hAPP mice. Our results indicate that Aβ, tau, and Fyn jointly impair synaptic and network function and suggest that disrupting the copathogenic relationship between these factors could be of therapeutic benefit.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease, which is defined pathologically by abundant amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles concurrent with synaptic and neuronal loss, is the most common underlying cause of dementia in the elderly. Among the oldest-old, those aged 90 and older, other ageing-related brain pathologies are prevalent in addition to Alzheimer's disease, including cerebrovascular disease and hippocampal sclerosis. Although definite Alzheimer's disease pathology can distinguish dementia from normal individuals, the pathologies underlying cognitive impairment, especially in the oldest-old, remain poorly understood. We therefore conducted studies to determine the relative contributions of Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis and the altered expression of three synaptic proteins to cognitive status and global cognitive function. Relative immunohistochemistry intensity measures were obtained for synaptophysin, Synaptic vesicle transporter Sv2 (now known as SV2A) and Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 in the outer molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus on the first 157 participants of 'The 90+ Study' who came to autopsy, including participants with dementia (n = 84), those with cognitive impairment but no dementia (n = 37) and those with normal cognition (n = 36). Thal phase, Braak stage, cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis and Pathological 43-kDa transactive response sequence DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) were also analysed. All measures were obtained blind to cognitive diagnosis. Global cognition was tested by the Mini-Mental State Examinaton. Logistic regression analysis explored the association between the pathological measures and the odds of being in the different cognitive groups whereas multiple regression analyses explored the association between pathological measures and global cognition scores. No measure clearly distinguished the control and cognitive impairment groups. Comparing the cognitive impairment and dementia groups, synaptophysin and SV2 were reduced, whereas Braak stage, TDP-43 and hippocampal sclerosis frequency increased. Thal phase and VGLUT1 did not distinguish the cognitive impairment and dementia groups. All measures distinguished the dementia and control groups and all markers associated with the cognitive test scores. When all markers were analysed simultaneously, a reduction in synaptophysin, a high Braak stage and the presence of TDP-43 and hippocampal sclerosis associated with global cognitive function. These findings suggest that tangle pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43 and perforant pathway synaptic loss are the major contributors to dementia in the oldest-old. Although an increase in plaque pathology and glutamatergic synaptic loss may be early events associated with cognitive impairment, we conclude that those with cognitive impairment, but no dementia, are indistinguishable from cognitively normal subjects based on the measures reported here.

AB  - Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to be a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent research has examined the potential importance of soluble species of Abeta in synaptic dysfunction, long before fibrillary Abeta is deposited and neurodegenerative changes occur. Hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity are disrupted in transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein with early onset familial AD mutations, and in rats after exogenous application of synthetic Abeta both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, naturally produced soluble Abeta was shown to block the persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the intact hippocampus. Sub-nanomolar concentrations of oligomeric Abeta were sufficient to inhibit late LTP, pointing to a possible reason for the sensitivity of hippocampus-dependent memory to impairment in the early preclinical stages of AD. Having identified the active species of Abeta that can play havoc with synaptic plasticity, it is hoped that new ways of targeting early AD can be developed.

AB  - Over the past several years researchers have engineered many transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. Since loss of memory is one of the major hallmarks of the disorder, the phenotypic characterization of these animals has included both behavioral tests which aim to evaluate learning abilities, and electrophysiological studies to analyze synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, a widely studied cellular model of learning and memory. These studies are fundamental for the design of novel therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Over the past several years researchers have engineered many transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. Since loss of memory is one of the major hallmarks of the disorder, the phenotypic characterization of these animals has included both behavioral tests which aim to evaluate learning abilities, and electrophysiological studies to analyze synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, a widely studied cellular model of learning and memory. These studies are fundamental for the design of novel therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the most common intraneuronal inclusion in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and have been implicated in mediating neuronal death and cognitive deficits. Here, we found that mice expressing a repressible human tau variant developed progressive age-related NFTs, neuronal loss, and behavioral impairments. After the suppression of transgenic tau, memory function recovered, and neuron numbers stabilized, but to our surprise, NFTs continued to accumulate. Thus, NFTs are not sufficient to cause cognitive decline or neuronal death in this model of tauopathy.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly prevalent neuropsychiatric conditions with intriguing epidemiological overlaps. Depressed patients are at increased risk of developing late-onset AD, and around one in four AD patients are co-diagnosed with MDD. Microglia are the main cellular effectors of innate immunity in the brain, and their activation is central to neuroinflammation – a ubiquitous process in brain pathology, thought to be a causal factor of both AD and MDD. Microglia serve several physiological functions, including roles in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, which may be disrupted in neuroinflammation. Following early work on the ‘sickness behavior’ of humans and other animals, microglia-derived inflammatory cytokines have been shown to produce depressive-like symptoms when administered exogenously or released in response to infection. MDD patients consistently show increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and anti-inflammatory drugs show promise for treating depression. Activated microglia are abundant in the AD brain, and concentrate around senile plaques, hallmark lesions composed of aggregated amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The Aβ burden in affected brains is regulated largely by microglial clearance, and the complex activation state of microglia may be crucial for AD progression. Intriguingly, recent reports have linked soluble Aβ oligomers, toxins that accumulate in AD brains and are thought to cause memory impairment, to increased brain cytokine production and depressive-like behavior in mice. Here, we review recent findings supporting the inflammatory hypotheses of AD and MDD, focusing on microglia as a common player and therapeutic target linking these devastating disorders.

AB  - In its earliest clinical phase, Alzheimer's disease characteristically produces a remarkably pure impairment of memory. Mounting evidence suggests that this syndrome begins with subtle alterations of hippocampal synaptic efficacy prior to frank neuronal degeneration, and that the synaptic dysfunction is caused by diffusible oligomeric assemblies of the amyloid β protein.

AB  - <i>Objectives:</i> (1) To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other forms of dementia; (2) to explore the association between agitation and other clinical variables, including disease severity, functional impairment and other neuropsychiatric symptoms, and (3) to determine the predictors of agitation. <i>Methods:</i> Data for 427 men and women with dementia from outpatient clinics of the University of California, Los Angeles Alzheimer’s Disease Center were analyzed. There were 277 patients with AD, 43 with vascular dementia, 47 with mixed dementia, 45 with frontotemporal dementia and 15 with dementia with Lewy bodies. Patients were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), neuropsychological tests and the Caregiver Appraisal instrument. SPSS10 was utilized for statistical analysis. <i>Results:</i> There was no difference in agitation subscale scores among patients with dementia of various etiologies. In patients with AD, there was increased prevalence of agitation with increasing dementia severity. Agitation contributed substantially to caregiver burden and impact. There was a significant correlation between the FAQ and the NPI agitation subscale score after adjusting for MMSE scores. Delusion, disinhibition and irritability subscale scores in AD patients were correlated with agitation across disease severity. Subscale scores of frontally mediated behaviors including irritability, delusions and disinhibition predicted most of the variance in agitation levels. <i>Conclusion:</i> Agitation is common in AD and other dementias and has a marked impact on caregivers. It is related to dementia severity and to specific types of associated psychopathology implicating frontal lobe dysfunction. The present study is the largest and most comprehensive assessment of agitation reported. The data suggest that agitation in AD is a frontal lobe syndrome. Frontal lobe dysfunction may predispose AD patients to agitation by exaggerating behavioral responses to many types of coexisting psychopathology or environmental provocations.

AB  - Protocols of systematic reviews and meta-analyses allow for planning and documentation of review methods, act as a guard against arbitrary decision making during review conduct, enable readers to assess for the presence of selective reporting against completed reviews, and, when made publicly available, reduce duplication of efforts and potentially prompt collaboration. Evidence documenting the existence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics is accumulating and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to rectify these problems, including development of an international register for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols (BioMed Central’s Systematic Reviews). Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols—PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol.This PRISMA-P 2015 Explanation and Elaboration paper provides readers with a full understanding of and evidence about the necessity of each item as well as a model example from an existing published protocol. This paper should be read together with the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. Systematic review authors and assessors are strongly encouraged to make use of PRISMA-P when drafting and appraising review protocols.%U http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/349/bmj.g7647.full.pdf

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia in the elderly. Pathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of Aβ-peptides that are proteolytic cleavage products of the amyloid-β precursor protein (‘plaques’) and by insoluble filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (‘tangles’). Familial forms of AD often display increased production of Aβ peptides and/or altered activity of presenilins, the catalytic subunits of gamma-secretase that produces Aβ peptides. Although the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, recent studies have highlighted two major themes that are likely important. First, oligomeric Aβ species have strong detrimental effects on synapse function and structure, particularly on the postsynaptic side; second, decreased presenilin function impairs synaptic transmission and promotes neurodegeneration. The mechanisms underlying these processes are beginning to be elucidated, and, although their relevance to AD remains debated, understanding these processes will likely allow new therapeutic avenues to AD.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction appears as a core feature of dementia, which includes its most prevalent form, Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and other brain disorders. AD alone affects more than 45 million people worldwide, with growing prevalence in aging populations. There is no cure, and therapeutic options remain limited. Gene-edited and transgenic animal models, expressing disease-specific gene mutations, illuminate pathogenic mechanisms leading to cognitive decline in AD and other forms of dementia. To date, cognitive tests in AD mouse models have not been directly relevant to the clinical presentation of AD, providing challenges for translation of findings to the clinic. Touchscreen testing in mice has enabled the assessment of specific cognitive domains in mice that are directly relevant to impairments described in human AD patients. In this review, we provide context for how cognitive decline is measured in the clinic, describe traditional methods for assessing cognition in mice, and outline novel approaches, including the use of the touchscreen platform for cognitive testing. We highlight the limitations of traditional memory-testing paradigms in mice, particularly their capacity for direct translation into cognitive testing of patients. While it is not possible to expect direct translation in testing methodologies, we can aim to develop tests that engage similar neural substrates in both humans and mice. Ultimately, that would enable us to better predict efficacy across species and therefore improve the chances that a treatment that works in mice will also work in the clinic.

AB  - Animal models have contributed significantly to our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, over 300 interventions have been investigated and reported to mitigate pathological phenotypes or improve behavior in AD animal models or both. To date, however, very few of these findings have resulted in target validation in humans or successful translation to disease-modifying therapies. Challenges in translating preclinical studies to clinical trials include the inability of animal models to recapitulate the human disease, variations in breeding and colony maintenance, lack of standards in design, conduct and analysis of animal trials, and publication bias due to under-reporting of negative results in the scientific literature. The quality of animal model research on novel therapeutics can be improved by bringing the rigor of human clinical trials to animal studies. Research communities in several disease areas have developed recommendations for the conduct and reporting of preclinical studies in order to increase their validity, reproducibility, and predictive value. To address these issues in the AD community, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation partnered with Charles River Discovery Services (Morrisville, NC, USA) and Cerebricon Ltd. (Kuopio, Finland) to convene an expert advisory panel of academic, industry, and government scientists to make recommendations on best practices for animal studies testing investigational AD therapies. The panel produced recommendations regarding the measurement, analysis, and reporting of relevant AD targets, th choice of animal model, quality control measures for breeding and colony maintenance, and preclinical animal study design. Major considerations to incorporate into preclinical study design include a priori hypotheses, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics studies prior to proof-of-concept testing, biomarker measurements, sample size determination, and power analysis. The panel also recommended distinguishing between pilot 'exploratory' animal studies and more extensive 'therapeutic' studies to guide interpretation. Finally, the panel proposed infrastructure and resource development, such as the establishment of a public data repository in which both positive animal studies and negative ones could be reported. By promoting best practices, these recommendations can improve the methodological quality and predictive value of AD animal studies and make the translation to human clinical trials more efficient and reliable.

AB  - Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau protein are both implicated in memory impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and early Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether and how they interact is unknown. Consequently, we asked whether tau protein is required for the robust phenomenon of Aβ-induced impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely accepted cellular model of memory. We used wild-type mice and mice with a genetic knock-out of tau protein and recorded field potentials in an acute slice preparation. We demonstrate that the absence of tau protein prevents Aβ-induced impairment of LTP. Moreover, we show that Aβ increases tau phosphorylation and that a specific inhibitor of the tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 blocks the increased tau phosphorylation induced by Aβ and prevents Aβ-induced impairment of LTP in wild-type mice. Together, these findings show that tau protein is required for Aβ to impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and suggest that the Aβ-induced impairment of LTP is mediated by tau phosphorylation. We conclude that preventing the interaction between Aβ and tau could be a promising strategy for treating cognitive impairment in MCI and early AD.

AB  - Systematic reviews are often advocated as the best source of evidence to guide both
               clinical decisions and healthcare policy, yet we know very little about the extent to
               which they require updating., To estimate the average time to changes in evidence sufficiently important to warrant
               updating systematic reviews (referred to as the survival time) and to identify any
               characteristics that increase or decrease these survival times. To determine the performance characteristics of various surveillance protocols to
               identify important new evidence. To assess the utility of rates and patterns of growth for evidence within clinical
               areas as predictors of updating needs. To establish typical timeframes for the production and publication of systematic
               reviews in order to assess the extent to which they impact survival time (e.g.,
               whether or not delays in the peer review and publication processes substantially
               shorten the time in the public domain before new evidence requires updating of a
               given systematic review). To characterize current updating practices and policies of agencies that sponsor
               systematic reviews., Survival analysis for a cohort of 100 quantitative systematic reviews that were
               indexed in ACP Journal Club with an accompanying commentary;
               supplementary sample of Cochrane reviews meeting the same criteria and AHRQ evidence
               reports; internet-based survey of agencies that sponsor or undertake systematic
               reviews., Eligible reviews evaluated the clinical benefit or harm of a specific (class of)
               drug, device, or procedure, were originally published between 1995 and 2005, and
               included at least one quantitative synthesis result in the form of an odds ratio,
               relative risk, risk difference, or mean difference. For the survey of updating
               policies and practices, we contacted 22 organizations that are well-known to produce
               or fund systematic reviews (including 12 AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Centers)., Systematic reviews indexed in ACP J Club and eligible new trials identified through
               five search protocols., Quantitative signals for updating consisted of changes in statistical significance or
               a relative change in effect magnitude of at least 50 percent involving one of the
               primary outcomes of the original systematic review or any mortality outcome. These
               signals were assessed by comparing the original meta-analytic results with updated
               results that included eligible new trials. Qualitative signals included substantial
               differences in characterizations of effectiveness, new information about harm,
               emergence of superior alternative treatments, and important caveats about the
               previously reported findings that would affect clinical decisionmaking. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of either a qualitative or
               quantitative signal for updating the original systematic review. We also assessed the
               occurrence of a signal for updating within 2 years of publication, as some sources
               (e.g., The Cochrane Library) currently recommend updating systematic reviews every
               two years. The survey measured existing updating policies, current strategies in use, and
               additional perceptions related to the updating process from the 18 organizations that
               responded., The cohort of 100 systematic reviews included a median of 13 studies (inter-quartile
               range: 8 to 21) and 2663 participants (inter-quartile range: 1281 to 8371) per
               review. A qualitative or quantitative signal for updating occurred for 57 systematic
               reviews. Median survival free of a signal for updating was 5.5 years (95% confidence
               interval [CI]: 4.6–7.6), but in 23 cases (95% CI: 15% to 33%), a signal for updating
               occurred in less than 2 years, and in 15 cases (95% CI: 9% to 24%) the signal
               occurred in less than 1 year. In 7 cases (95% CI: 3% to 14%), a signal had already
               occurred at the time of publication of the original review. Shorter survival was
               associated with cardiovascular medicine (hazard ratio of 3.26, 95% CI: 1.71 to 6.21;
               p =0.0003), heterogeneity in the original review (hazard ratio of 2.23, 95% CI: 1.22
               to 4.09; p =0.01), and having a new trial larger than the previous largest trial
               (hazard ratio of 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.15; p =0.01). Systematic reviews with more
               than the median of 13 included studies had increased survival (hazard ratio of 0.55;
               95% CI: 0.31 to 0.98; p =0.04). No feature of the original review significantly
               predicted a signal for updating occurring within 2 years of publication. Median time from the final search date to indexing 1.4 years (inter-quartile range;
               0.96–2.0 years). Lags from search to publication were shortest for Cochrane reviews
               (median 0.6 years, inter-quartile range: 0.42–1.25) and longest for journal reviews
               (median 1.3 years; inter-quartile range: 0.84–1.77), with technical reports falling
               in between (median 1.1 years; inter-quartile range: 0.87–1.42) (Kruskal Wallis χ2
               11.24, p =0.004). Of the five search protocols tested for their effectiveness in identifying eligible
               new trials, the combination with the highest recall and lowest screening burden were
               the strategy that used the PubMed Related Articles feature (applied to the three
               newest and three largest trials included in the original review) and the strategy
               involved submitting a subject search (based on population and intervention) to the
               Clinical Query filter for therapy. This combination identified most new signaling
               evidence with median screening burden of 71 new records per review. For the survey of organizations involved in producing or funding systematic reviews,
               we received responses from 19 (86%) of the 22 organizations contacted. Approximately
               two thirds (68%) of respondents identified themselves as producers of systematic
               reviews and an additional 21% identified themselves as both funders and producers of
               systematic reviews. Only two respondents (11%) characterized themselves solely as
               funders of systematic reviews. Approximately 80% of respondents characterized the importance of updating as ‘high’
               or ‘very high’, although 68% acknowledged not having any formal policies for updating
               in place. Approximately two thirds (13/19; 68%) of respondents reported that over 20%
               of the reviews they commission or produce are out of date, and 32% respondents (6/19)
               reported that at least 50% of their reviews were out of date. Barriers to updating
               identified by respondents included lack of appropriate methodologies, resource
               constraints, lack of academic credit, and limited publishing formats. The majority of
               the sample (16/19; 84%) indicated they ‘somewhat’ to ‘strongly’ favor the development
               of a central registry, analogous to efforts within the clinical trials community, to
               coordinate updating activities across agencies and review groups., In a cohort of high quality systematic reviews directly relevant to clinical
               practice, signals for updating occurred frequently and within relatively short
               timelines. A number of features significantly affected survival, but none
               significantly predicted the need for updating within 2 years. Currently, definitive methods about the frequency of updating cannot be made. Blanket
               recommendation such as every two years will miss a substantial number of important
               signals for updating that occur within shorter time lines, but more frequent updates
               will expend substantial resources. Methods for identifying reviews in need of
               updating based on surveillance for new evidence hold more promise than relying on
               features of the original review to identify reviews likely to need updating within a
               short time, but such approaches will require further investigation. Several of the
               methods tested were feasible, yielding good recall of relevant new evidence with
               modest screening burdens. The majority of organizations engaged in the funding or production of systematic
               reviews view the importance of updating systematic reviews as high to very high.
               Despite this recognition, most organizations report having no formal policy in place
               for updating previous systematic reviews. Slightly less than half of organizations
               performed periodic literature searches to identify new evidence, but searching
               frequencies varied widely, from monthly to every two years. If systematic reviews are to achieve their stated goal of providing the best evidence
               to inform clinical decision making and healthcare policy, issues related to
               identifying reviews in need of updating will require much greater attention. In the
               meantime, publishers of systematic reviews should consider a policy of requiring
               authors to update searches performed over 12 months prior to submission. And, users
               of systematic reviews need to recognize that important new evidence can appear within
               short timelines. When considering the results of a particular systematic review,
               users should search for more recent reviews or trials to see if any exist and
               determine if the results are consistent with the previous review.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of progressive dementia and most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. The prevalence rate of AD is expected to get triple by 2050. Pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid-β containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are composed of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. AD may be classified as early-onset (familial AD) and late-onset (sporadic AD). Familial AD occurs mostly in individuals of age 30–60 years and associated with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin (PS1 and PS2) genes, while sporadic AD mainly affects persons after 65 years of age and associated with mutations in apolipoprotein E4 isoform (apoE4) IR dysfunction, etc. Clinical interpretation of AD basically involves progressive deterioration in capabilities of memory, language, calculation, judgment, and behavior. AD is associated with disruption of mitochondrial function, calcium homeostasis, hormonal balance, and increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Animal model has played a major role in defining critical disease-related mechanisms and evaluating novel therapeutic approaches in research. The sporadic form of AD itself probably involves several different etiopathogenic mechanisms. Neuroinflammation, head trauma, brain ischemia, and diabetes have been implicated as risk factors for AD.

AB  - The reproducibility of laboratory experiments is fundamental to the scientific process. There have been increasing reports regarding challenges in reproducing and translating preclinical experiments in animal models. In Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, there have been similar reports and growing interest from funding organizations, researchers, and the broader scientific community to set parameters around experimental design, statistical power, and reporting requirements. A number of efforts in recent years have attempted to develop standard guidelines; however, these have not yet been widely implemented by researchers or by funding agencies. A workgroup of the International Alzheimer's disease Research Funder Consortium, a group of over 30 research funding agencies from around the world, worked to compile the best practices identified in these prior efforts for preclinical biomedical research. This article represents a consensus of this work group's review and includes recommendations for researchers and funding agencies on designing, performing, reviewing, and funding preclinical research studies.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the only leading cause of death for which no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Recent disappointing trial results at the dementia stage of AD have raised multiple questions about our current approaches to the development of disease-modifying agents. Converging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins many years before the onset of dementia. So why do we keep testing drugs aimed at the initial stages of the disease process in patients at the end-stage of the illness?

AB  - During recent years, the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a major focus of research. Continued failures in clinical trials and the realization that early intervention may offer better therapeutic outcome triggered a conceptual shift from late-stage AD pathology to early-stage pathophysiology. While much effort has been directed at understanding the factors initiating AD, little is known about the principle basis underlying the disease progression at its early stages. In this Perspective, we suggest a hypothesis to explain the transition from ‘silent’ signatures of aberrant neural circuit activity to clinically evident memory impairments. Namely, we propose that failures in firing homeostasis and imbalance between firing stability and synaptic plasticity in cortico-hippocampal circuits represent the driving force of early disease progression. We analyze the main types of possible homeostatic failures and provide the essential conceptual framework for examining the causal link between dysregulation of firing homeostasis, aberrant neural circuit activity and memory-related plasticity impairments associated with early AD.

AB  - This brief review summarizes 60 years of conceptual advances that have demonstrated a role for active changes in neuronal connectivity as a controller of behavior and behavioral change. Seminal studies in the first phase of the six-decade span of this review firmly established the cellular basis of behavior - a concept that we take for granted now, but which was an open question at the time. Hebbian plasticity, including long-term potentiation and long-term depression, was then discovered as being important for local circuit refinement in the context of memory formation and behavioral change and stabilization in the mammalian central nervous system. Direct demonstration of plasticity of neuronal circuit function in vivo, for example, hippocampal neurons forming place cell firing patterns, extended this concept. However, additional neurophysiologic and computational studies demonstrated that circuit development and stabilization additionally relies on non-Hebbian, homoeostatic, forms of plasticity, such as synaptic scaling and control of membrane intrinsic properties. Activity-dependent neurodevelopment was found to be associated with cell-wide adjustments in post-synaptic receptor density, and found to occur in conjunction with synaptic pruning. Pioneering cellular neurophysiologic studies demonstrated the critical roles of transmembrane signal transduction, NMDA receptor regulation, regulation of neural membrane biophysical properties, and back-propagating action potential in critical time-dependent coincidence detection in behavior-modifying circuits. Concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, regulation of gene transcription was found to serve as a bridge between experience and behavioral change, closing the 'nature versus nurture' divide. Both active DNA (de)methylation and regulation of chromatin structure have been validated as crucial regulators of gene transcription during learning. The discovery of protein synthesis dependence on the acquisition of behavioral change was an influential discovery in the neurochemistry of behavioral modification. Higher order cognitive functions such as decision making and spatial and language learning were also discovered to hinge on neural plasticity mechanisms. The role of disruption of these processes in intellectual disabilities, memory disorders, and drug addiction has recently been clarified based on modern genetic techniques, including in the human. The area of neural plasticity and behavior has seen tremendous advances over the last six decades, with many of those advances being specifically in the neurochemistry domain. This review provides an overview of the progress in the area of neuroplasticity and behavior over the life-span of the Journal of Neurochemistry. To organize the broad literature base, the review collates progress into fifteen broad categories identified as 'conceptual advances', as viewed by the author. The fifteen areas are delineated in the figure above. This article is part of the 60th Anniversary special issue.

AB  - Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is supposed to play the central role for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fibrillar forms of Abeta that compose amyloid plaques were investigated as the causative agents for AD however soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) are now regarded as the most toxic Abeta species leading to neuronal damage. Prion-like spread of AbetaOs is also supposed for transduction of AD pathology in brain. Many investigations to clarify the mechanism of AbetaOs toxicity are under way. However it is still unclear what types of AbetaOs exert the main neurotoxicity what the ligand to AbetaOs is and how neurotoxicity is exerted. Abeta easily aggregate under membrane environment especially with membrane with GM1 ganglioside that constitutes lipid rafts. We have previously shown that accumulation of Abeta dimers in lipid rafts is the earliest event corresponding to behavioral deficits in AD model mice Tg2576. Abeta dimers are shown to be cardinal molecules for synaptic dysfunction in As amyloid cascades in AD pathogenesis. Accumulation of AbetaOs in lipid rafts of synapse induced fyn-NMDA cascade and phosphorylated tau. The mechanism of AbetaOs toxicity will be discussed. AbetaOs are the promising targets for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for AD. The recent success of a phase 1b randomized trial of aducanumab also showed that anti-AbetaOs antibodies are clinically useful. We generated a novel transgenic plant-based vaccine. Oral administration of the vaccine decreased soluble AbetaOs increased insoluble Abeta aggregates decreased inflammation in brain and prevented spatial learning. The plant vaccine could be a promising cheap and safe DMT to prevent AD pathological process. Foresights of DTMs targeting AbetaOs will be discussed.

AB  - The observation of the locomotor and exploratory behaviors of rodents in an open field is one of the most fundamental methods used in the field of behavioral pharmacology. A variety of behaviors can be recorded automatically and can readily generate a multivariate pattern of pharmacological effects. Nevertheless, the optimal ways to characterize observed behaviors and concomitant drug effects are still under development. The aim of this study was to extract meaningful behavioral factors that could explain variations in the observed variables from mouse exploration. Behavioral data were recorded from male C57BL/6J mice (n=268) using the Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM). The BPM data were subjected to the exploratory factor analysis. The factor analysis extracted four factors: activity, sequential organization, diversive exploration, and inspective exploration. The activity factor and the two types of exploration factors correlated positively with one another, while the sequential organization factor negatively correlated with the remaining factors. The extracted factor structure constitutes a behavioral model of mouse exploration. This model will provide a platform on which one can assess the effects of psychoactive drugs and genetic manipulations on mouse exploratory behavior. Further studies are currently underway to examine the factor structure of similar multivariate data sets from humans tested in a human BPM.

AB  - Testing of cognitive functions in rodent disease models constitutes a substantial sector of behavioral neuroscience. It is most often needed in phenotyping genetically modified new rodent (usually mouse) lines or in preclinical testing of cognitive effects of new CNS drugs. This review concerns present pitfalls and future perspectives in this large field, with an emphasis on memory testing in CNS disease models and their preclinical drug testing. It is important to realize that no behavioral test is specific for a single cognitive domain. There are numerous noncognitive factors that may lead to impaired performance in most widely applied memory tasks. It is important to rule these out by applying a battery of test that should include at least tests for motor functions, spontaneous activity and anxiety besides cognitive aspects. In addition, considering and reporting all task-relavant details will help to resolve the common problem that certain behavioral findings cannot be reproduced by other laboratories. More collaboration between molecular and behavioral neuroscience laboratories and systematic training of young neuroscientist on behavioral techniques will help ensure quality of behavioral studies in the future.

AB  - We present here both linear regressions and multivariate analyses correlating three global neuropsychological tests with a number of structural and neurochemical measurements performed on a prospective series of 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 9 neuropathologically normal subjects. The statistical data show only weak correlations between psychometric indices and plaques and tangles, but the density of neocortical synapses measured by a new immunocytochemical/densitometric technique reveals very powerful correlations with all three psychological assays. Multivariate analysis by stepwise regression produced a model including midfrontal and inferior parietal synapse density, plus inferior parietal plaque counts with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 for Mattis's Dementia Rating Scale. Plaque density contributed only 26% of that strength.

AB  - Background Cochrane reviews are regarded as being scientifically rigorous and are increasingly used by a variety of stakeholders. However, factors predicting the publication of Cochrane reviews have never been reported. This is important because if a higher proportion of Cochrane protocols with certain characteristics (e.g., funding) are being published, this may lead to inaccurate decisions. We examined the frequency of published and unpublished Cochrane reviews and protocol factors that predict the publication of Cochrane reviews. Methodology/Principal Findings Retrospective cohort study of Cochrane protocols published in 2000 (Issues 2 to 4) and 2001 (Issue 1). The publication status of these reviews was followed up to Issue 1, 2008 in The Cochrane Library. Survival analysis of the time from protocol publication to the first review publication and protocol factors predicting the time to publication was conducted. There were 411 new Cochrane protocols in the cohort. After excluding 39; 71/372 (19.1%) were unpublished and 301/372 (80.9%) were published as full Cochrane reviews at the time of study analysis (January 2008). The median time to publication was 2.4 years (range: 0.15 to 8.96). Multivariate analyses revealed that shorter time to publication was associated with the review subsequently being updated (hazard ratio, HR: 1.80 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.39 to 2.33 years]) and longer time to publication was associated with the review having two published protocols, indicating changes to the review plan (HR: 0.33 [95% CI: 0.12 to 0.90 years]). Conclusions/Significance Only about 80% Cochrane protocols were published as full reviews after over 8 years of follow-up. The median time to publication was 2.4 years and some reviews took much longer. Strategies to decrease time to publication should be considered, such as streamlining the review process, increased support for authors when protocol amendments occur, and better infrastructure for updating Cochrane reviews.

AB  - Systematic reviews, a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine, are not produced quickly enough to support clinical practice. The cost of production, availability of the requisite expertise and timeliness are often quoted as major contributors for the delay. This detailed survey of the state of the art of information systems designed to support or automate individual tasks in the systematic review, and in particular systematic reviews of randomized controlled clinical trials, reveals trends that see the convergence of several parallel research projects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An overwhelming body of evidence stating that the completeness of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal has accrued over time. In the mid-1990s, in response to these concerns, an international group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical journal editors developed the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement. The CONSORT Statement, most recently updated in March 2010, is an evidence-based minimum set of recommendations including a checklist and flow diagram for reporting RCTs and is intended to facilitate the complete and transparent reporting of trials and aid their critical appraisal and interpretation. In 2006, a systematic review of eight studies evaluating the "effectiveness of CONSORT in improving reporting quality in journals" was published. OBJECTIVES: To update the earlier systematic review assessing whether journal endorsement of the 1996 and 2001 CONSORT checklists influences the completeness of reporting of RCTs published in medical journals. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted electronic searches, known item searching, and reference list scans to identify reports of evaluations assessing the completeness of reporting of RCTs. The electronic search strategy was developed in MEDLINE and tailored to EMBASE. We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the Wiley interface. We searched the Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index through the ISI Web of Knowledge interface. We conducted all searches to identify reports published between January 2005 and March 2010, inclusive. SELECTION CRITERIA: In addition to studies identified in the original systematic review on this topic, comparative studies evaluating the completeness of reporting of RCTs in any of the following comparison groups were eligible for inclusion in this review: 1) Completeness of reporting of RCTs published in journals that have and have not endorsed the CONSORT Statement; 2) Completeness of reporting of RCTs published in CONSORT-endorsing journals before and after endorsement; or 3) Completeness of reporting of RCTs before and after the publication of the CONSORT Statement (1996 or 2001). We used a broad definition of CONSORT endorsement that includes any of the following: (a) requirement or recommendation in journal's 'Instructions to Authors' to follow CONSORT guidelines; (b) journal editorial statement endorsing the CONSORT Statement; or (c) editorial requirement for authors to submit a CONSORT checklist and/or flow diagram with their manuscript. We contacted authors of evaluations reporting data that could be included in any comparison group(s), but not presented as such in the published report and asked them to provide additional data in order to determine eligibility of their evaluation. Evaluations were not excluded due to language of publication or validity assessment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We completed screening and data extraction using standardised electronic forms, where conflicts, reasons for exclusion, and level of agreement were all automatically and centrally managed in web-based management software, DistillerSR((R)). One of two authors extracted general characteristics of included evaluations and all data were verified by a second author. Data describing completeness of reporting were extracted by one author using a pre-specified form; a 10% random sample of evaluations was verified by a second author. Any discrepancies were discussed by both authors; we made no modifications to the extracted data. Validity assessments of included evaluations were conducted by one author and independently verified by one of three authors. We resolved all conflicts by consensus.For each comparison we collected data on 27 outcomes: 22 items of the CONSORT 2001 checklist, plus four items relating to the reporting of blinding, and one item of aggregate CONSORT scores. Where reported, we extracted and qualitatively synthesised data on the methodological quality of RCTs, by scale or score. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-three publications reporting 50 evaluations were included. The total number of RCTs assessed within evaluations was 16,604 (median per evaluation 123 (interquartile range (IQR) 77 to 226) published in a median of six (IQR 3 to 26) journals. Characteristics of the included RCT populations were variable, resulting in heterogeneity between included evaluations. Validity assessments of included studies resulted in largely unclear judgements. The included evaluations are not RCTs and less than 8% (4/53) of the evaluations reported adjusting for potential confounding factors. Twenty-five of 27 outcomes assessing completeness of reporting in RCTs appeared to favour CONSORT-endorsing journals over non-endorsers, of which five were statistically significant. 'Allocation concealment' resulted in the largest effect, with risk ratio (RR) 1.81 (99% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.61), suggesting that 81% more RCTs published in CONSORT-endorsing journals adequately describe allocation concealment compared to those published in non-endorsing journals. Allocation concealment was reported adequately in 45% (393/876) of RCTs in CONSORT-endorsing journals and in 22% (329/1520) of RCTs in non-endorsing journals. Other outcomes with results that were significant include: scientific rationale and background in the 'Introduction' (RR 1.07, 99% CI 1.01 to 1.14); 'sample size' (RR 1.61, 99% CI 1.13 to 2.29); method used for 'sequence generation' (RR 1.59, 99% CI 1.38 to 1.84); and an aggregate score over reported CONSORT items, 'total sum score' (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.68 (99% CI 0.38 to 0.98)). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence has accumulated to suggest that the reporting of RCTs remains sub-optimal. This review updates a previous systematic review of eight evaluations. The findings of this review are similar to those from the original review and demonstrate that, despite the general inadequacies of reporting of RCTs, journal endorsement of the CONSORT Statement may beneficially influence the completeness of reporting of trials published in medical journals. Future prospective studies are needed to explore the influence of the CONSORT Statement dependent on the extent of editorial policies to ensure adherence to CONSORT guidance.

AB  - Most observers in behaviour studies are aware of relevant information about the animals being observed. We investigated whether observer expectations influence subjective scoring methods during a class practicum. Veterinary students were trained in recording negative and positive interactions between pigs, in scoring the degree of panting in cattle and in applying qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) using a fixed set of terms for assessing hens' behaviour. The students applied these methods in three trials in which they were shown duplicated video recordings of the same animals: the original and a slightly modified version (to prevent recognition at second viewing). When scoring the duplicated recordings they were told either correct or false information about the conditions in which the animals had been filmed. The false information reflected plausible study scenarios in ethology and was used to create expectations about the outcome. As in reality the students scored the identical behaviour twice, the difference in the scores for the original and modified recordings reflects expectation bias due to providing different contextual information. In all trials there was evidence of expectation bias: students scored the ratio of positive to negative interactions higher when told that the observed pigs had been selected for high social breeding value, they scored cattle panting higher when told that the ambient temperature was 5°C higher than in reality, and in the QBA they indicated more positive and fewer negative emotions when told that the hens were from an organic instead of a conventional farm. The magnitude of the bias in the QBA trial was related to the opinion of the students about hen welfare in organic versus conventional farms. Although veterinary students may not be representative of practising ethologists, these findings do indicate that observer bias could influence subjective scores of animal behaviour and welfare.

AB  - Systematic reviews are a cornerstone of today's evidence-informed decision making. With the rapid expansion of questions to be addressed and scientific information produced, there is a growing workload on reviewers, making the current practice unsustainable without the aid of automation tools. While many automation tools have been developed and are available, uptake seems to be lagging. For this reason, we set out to investigate the current level of uptake and what the potential barriers and facilitators are for the adoption of automation tools in systematic reviews. We deployed surveys among systematic reviewers that gathered information on tool uptake, demographics, systematic review characteristics, and barriers and facilitators for uptake. Systematic reviewers from multiple domains were targeted during recruitment; however, responders were predominantly from the biomedical sciences. We found that automation tools are currently not widely used among the participants. When tools are used, participants mostly learn about them from their environment, for example, through colleagues, peers, or organization. Tools are often chosen on the basis of user experience, either by own experience or from colleagues or peers. Lastly, licensing, steep learning curve, lack of support, and mismatch to workflow are often reported by participants as relevant barriers. While conclusions can only be drawn for the biomedical field, our work provides evidence and confirms the conclusions and recommendations of previous work, which was based on expert opinions. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance that organizations and best practices in a field can have for the uptake of automation tools for systematic reviews.

AB  - Scientific progress requires that findings can be reproduced by other scientists. However, there is widespread debate in psychology (and other fields) about how to interpret failed replications. Many have argued that contextual factors might account for several of these failed replications. We analyzed 100 replication attempts in psychology and found that the extent to which the research topic was likely to be contextually sensitive (varying in time, culture, or location) was associated with replication success. This relationship remained a significant predictor of replication success even after adjusting for characteristics of the original and replication studies that previously had been associated with replication success (e.g., effect size, statistical power). We offer recommendations for psychologists and other scientists interested in reproducibility.In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to reproducibility. For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39% could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher’s degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed “hidden moderators”) between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should be mindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process. We offer several guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in reproducibility.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for most of the dementia cases, is, aside from cognitive deterioration, often characterized by the presence of non-cognitive symptoms such as activity and sleep disturbances. AD patients typically experience increased sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness and night-time insomnia. Here, we sought to investigate the link between sleep architecture, cognition and amyloid pathology in the APP23 amyloidosis mouse model for AD. By means of polysomnographic recordings the sleep-wake cycle of freely-moving APP23 and wild-type (WT) littermates of 3, 6 and 12 months of age was examined. In addition, ambulatory cage activity was assessed by interruption of infrared beams surrounding the home cage. To assess visuo-spatial learning and memory a hidden-platform Morris-type Water Maze (MWM) experiment was performed. We found that sleep architecture is only slightly altered at early stages of pathology, but significantly deteriorates from 12 months of age, when amyloid plaques become diffusely present. APP23 mice of 12 months old had quantitative reductions of NREM and REM sleep and were more awake during the dark phase compared to WT littermates. These findings were confirmed by increased ambulatory cage activity during that phase of the light-dark cycle. No quantitative differences in sleep parameters were observed during the light phase. However, during this light phase, the sleep pattern of APP23 mice was more fragmented from 6 months of age, the point at which also cognitive abilities started to be affected in the MWM. Sleep time also positively correlated with MWM performance. We also found that spectral components in the EEG started to alter at the age of 6 months. To conclude, our results indicate that sleep architectural changes arise around the time the first amyloid plaques start to form and cognitive deterioration becomes apparent. These changes start subtle, but gradually worsen with age, adequately mimicking the clinical condition.

To assess visuo-spatial learning and memory a hidden-platform Morris-type Water Maze (MWM) experiment was performed. We found that sleep architecture is only slightly altered at early stages of pathology, but significantly deteriorates from 12 months of age, when amyloid plaques become diffusely present. APP23 mice of 12 months old had quantitative reductions of NREM and REM sleep and were more awake during the dark phase compared to WT littermates. These findings were confirmed by increased ambulatory cage activity during that phase of the light-dark cycle. No quantitative differences in sleep parameters were observed during the light phase. However, during this light phase, the sleep pattern of APP23 mice was more fragmented from 6 months of age, the point at which also cognitive abilities started to be affected in the MWM. Sleep time also positively correlated with MWM performance. We also found that spectral components in the EEG started to alter at the age of 6 months. To conclude, our results indicate that sleep architectural changes arise around the time the first amyloid plaques start to form and cognitive deterioration becomes apparent. These changes start subtle, but gradually worsen with age, adequately mimicking the clinical condition.

AB  - Confirmation bias is a tendency of people to interpret information in a way that confirms their expectations. A long recognized phenomenon in human psychology, confirmation bias can distort the results of a study and thus reduce its reliability. While confirmation bias can be avoided by conducting studies blind to treatment groups, this practice is not always used. Surprisingly, this is true of research in animal behaviour, and the extent to which confirmation bias influences research outcomes in this field is rarely investigated. Here we conducted a meta-analysis, using studies on nestmate recognition in ants, to compare the outcomes of studies that were conducted blind with those that were not. Nestmate recognition studies typically perform intra- and inter colony aggression assays, with the a priori expectation that there should be little or no aggression among nestmates. Aggressive interactions between ants can include subtle behaviours such as mandible flaring and recoil, which can be hard to quantify, making these types of assays prone to confirmation bias. Our survey revealed that only 29% of our sample of 79 studies were conducted blind. These studies were more likely to report aggression among nestmates if they were conducted blind (73%) than if they were not (21%). Moreover, we found that the effect size between nestmate and non-nestmate treatment means is significantly lower in experiments conducted blind than those in which colony identity is known (1.38 versus 2.76). We discuss the implications of the impact of confirmation bias for research that attempts to obtain quantitative synthesises of data from different studies.

AB  - Clinical trial failures (>99%) in Alzheimer's disease are in stark contrast to positive efficacy data in animals. We evaluated the correlation between animal and clinical efficacy outcomes (cognition) in Alzheimer's disease using data from registered drugs as well as interventions tested in phase II or III clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. We identified 20 interventions, which were tested in 208 animal studies in 63 different animal models. Clinical outcome was correlated with animal results in 58% of cases. But, individual animal models showed divergent results across interventions, individual interventions showed divergent results across animal models, and animal model outcomes were determined with 16 different methods. This result is unsurprising due to poor external validity (what do we model) of the animal models. Although the animal models all share Alzheimer's disease symptoms, none represents the whole syndrome. Investigators did not motivate why one model was chosen over another, and did not consider the ways the disease phenomena were generated (spontaneous, (experimentally) induced or by genetic modification), or the species characteristics, which determine the outcomes. The explanation for the lack of correlation between animal and human outcomes can be manifold: the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is not reflected in the animal model or the outcomes are not comparable. Our conclusion is that currently no animal models exist which are predictive for the efficacy of interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - ContextDuplicate publication is publication of an article that overlaps substantially with an article published elsewhere. Patterns of duplication are not well understood.ObjectiveTo investigate duplication patterns and propose a decision tree for classification.Data SourcesWe searched a comprehensive list of systematic reviews (1989 through August 15, 2002) in anesthesia and analgesia that is accessible on the Internet. We selected published full articles of duplicates that had been identified in these systematic reviews. Abstracts, letters, or book chapters were excluded.Study Selection and Data ExtractionAuthors of 56 (40%) of 141 systematic reviews acknowledged identification of duplicates. Duplication patterns were identified independently by all investigators comparing samples and outcomes of pairs of duplicates and main articles. Information on cross-reference, sponsorship, authorship, and publication characteristics was extracted from the articles.Data SynthesisThe 56 systematic reviews included 1131 main articles (129 337 subjects) and excluded 103 duplicates (12 589 subjects) that originated from 78 main articles. Sixty articles were published twice, 13 three times, 3 four times, and 2 five times. We identified 6 duplication patterns: (1A) identical samples and identical outcomes (21 pairs); (1B) same as 1A but several duplicates assembled (n = 16); (2) identical samples and different outcomes (n = 24); (3A) increasing sample and identical outcomes (n = 11); (3B) decreasing sample and identical outcomes (n = 11); (4) different samples and different outcomes (n = 20). The prevalence of covert duplicate articles (without a cross-reference to the main article) was 5.3% (65/1234). Of the duplicates, 34 (33%) were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, and 66 (64%) had authorship that differed partly or completely from the main article. The median journal impact factor was 1.8 (range, 0.1-29.5) for duplicates and 2.0 (range, 0.4-29.5) for main articles (P = .13). The median annual citation rate was 1.7 (range, 0-27) for duplicates and 2.1 (range, 0-31) for main articles (P = .45). The median number of authors was 4 (range, 1-14) for duplicates and 4 (range, 1-15) for corresponding main articles (P = .02). The median delay in publication between main articles and duplicates was 1 year (range, 0-7 years).ConclusionsDuplication goes beyond simple copying. Six distinct duplication patterns were identified after comparing study samples and outcomes of duplicates and corresponding main articles. Authorship was an unreliable criterion. Duplicates were published in journals with similar impact factors and were cited as frequently as main articles.

AB  - Summary Epileptic activity is frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease; this association has therapeutic implications, because epileptic activity can occur at early disease stages and might contribute to pathogenesis. In clinical practice, seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease can easily go unrecognised because they usually present as non-motor seizures, and can overlap with other symptoms of the disease. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, seizures can hasten cognitive decline, highlighting the clinical relevance of early recognition and treatment. Some evidence indicates that subclinical epileptiform activity in patients with Alzheimer's disease, detected by extended neurophysiological monitoring, can also lead to accelerated cognitive decline. Treatment of clinical seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease with select antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in low doses, is usually well tolerated and efficacious. Moreover, studies in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease suggest that certain classes of AEDs that reduce network hyperexcitability have disease-modifying properties. These AEDs target mechanisms of epileptogenesis involving amyloid β and tau. Clinical trials targeting network hyperexcitability in patients with Alzheimer's disease will identify whether AEDs or related strategies could improve their cognitive symptoms or slow decline.

AB  - Abstract It is sometimes supposed that standardizing tests of mouse behavior will ensure similar results in different laboratories. We evaluated this supposition by conducting behavioral tests with identical apparatus and test protocols in independent laboratories. Eight genetic groups of mice, including equal numbers of males and females, were either bred locally or shipped from the supplier and then tested on six behaviors simultaneously in three laboratories (Albany, NY; Edmonton, AB; Portland, OR). The behaviors included locomotor activity in a small box, the elevated plus maze, accelerating rotarod, visible platform water escape, cocaine activation of locomotor activity, and ethanol preference in a two-bottle test. A preliminary report of this study presented a conventional analysis of conventional measures that revealed strong effects of both genotype and laboratory as well as noteworthy interactions between genotype and laboratory. We now report a more detailed analysis of additional measures and view the data for each test in different ways. Whether mice were shipped from a supplier or bred locally had negligible effects for almost every measure in the six tests, and sex differences were also absent or very small for most behaviors, whereas genetic effects were almost always large. For locomotor activity, cocaine activation, and elevated plus maze, the analysis demonstrated the strong dependence of genetic differences in behavior on the laboratory giving the tests. For ethanol preference and water escape learning, on the other hand, the three labs obtained essentially the same results for key indicators of behavior. Thus, it is clear that the strong dependence of results on the specific laboratory is itself dependent on the task in question. Our results suggest that there may be advantages of test standardization, but laboratory environments probably can never be made sufficiently similar to guarantee identical results on a wide range of tests in a wide range of labs. Interpretations of our results by colleagues in neuroscience as well as the mass media are reviewed. Pessimistic views, prevalent in the media but relatively uncommon among neuroscientists, of mouse behavioral tests as being highly unreliable are contradicted by our data. Despite the presence of noteworthy interactions between genotype and lab environment, most of the larger differences between inbred strains were replicated across the three labs. Strain differences of moderate effects size, on the other hand, often differed markedly among labs, especially those involving three 129-derived strains. Implications for behavioral screening of targeted and induced mutations in mice are discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Neurobiol 54: 283–311, 2003

AB  - Systematic reviews address a specific clinical question by unbiasedly assessing and analyzing the pertinent literature. Citation screening is a time-consuming and critical step in systematic reviews. Typically, reviewers must evaluate thousands of citations to identify articles eligible for a given review. We explore the application of machine learning techniques to semi-automate citation screening, thereby reducing the reviewers' workload.

AB  - Background: Meta-analysis is increasingly used to summarise the findings identified in systematic reviews of animal studies modelling human disease. Such reviews typically identify a large number of individually small studies, testing efficacy under a variety of conditions. This leads to substantial heterogeneity, and identifying potential sources of this heterogeneity is an important function of such analyses. However, the statistical performance of different approaches (normalised compared with standardised mean difference estimates of effect size; stratified meta-analysis compared with meta-regression) is not known. Methods: Using data from 3116 experiments in focal cerebral ischaemia to construct a linear model predicting observed improvement in outcome contingent on 25 independent variables. We used stochastic simulation to attribute these variables to simulated studies according to their prevalence. To ascertain the ability to detect an effect of a given variable we introduced in addition this "variable of interest" of given prevalence and effect. To establish any impact of a latent variable on the apparent influence of the variable of interest we also introduced a "latent confounding variable" with given prevalence and effect, and allowed the prevalence of the variable of interest to be different in the presence and absence of the latent variable. Results: Generally, the normalised mean difference (NMD) approach had higher statistical power than the standardised mean difference (SMD) approach. Even when the effect size and the number of studies contributing to the meta-analysis was small, there was good statistical power to detect the overall effect, with a low false positive rate. For detecting an effect of the variable of interest, stratified meta-analysis was associated with a substantial false positive rate with NMD estimates of effect size, while using an SMD estimate of effect size had very low statistical power. Univariate and multivariable meta-regression performed substantially better, with low false positive rate for both NMD and SMD approaches; power was higher for NMD than for SMD. The presence or absence of a latent confounding variables only introduced an apparent effect of the variable of interest when there was substantial asymmetry in the prevalence of the variable of interest in the presence or absence of the confounding variable. Conclusions: In meta-analysis of data from animal studies, NMD estimates of effect size should be used in preference to SMD estimates, and meta-regression should, where possible, be chosen over stratified meta-analysis. The power to detect the influence of the variable of interest depends on the effect of the variable of interest and its prevalence, but unless effects are very large adequate power is only achieved once at least 100 experiments are included in the meta-analysis.

AB  - Abstract
          
            Background:
            Natural language processing could assist multiple tasks in systematic reviews to reduce workflow, including the extraction of PICO elements such as study populations, interventions and outcomes. The PICO framework provides a basis for the retrieval and selection for inclusion of published evidence relevant to a specific systematic review question, and automatic approaches of PICO extraction have been developed particularly for reviews of clinical trial findings. Considering the difference between preclinical animal studies and clinical trials, developing separate approaches are necessary. Facilitating preclinical systematic reviews will inform the translation from preclinical to clinical research.
            Methods:
            We randomly selected 400 abstracts from the PubMed Central Open Access database which described in vivo animal research and manually annotated these with PICO phrases for Species, Strain, model Induction, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome. We developed a two-stage workflow for preclinical PICO extraction. Firstly we fine-tuned BERT with different pre-trained modules for PICO sentence classification. Then, after removing text irrelevant to PICO features, we explored LSTM, CRF and BERT-based models for PICO entity recognition. We also explored a self-training approach because of the small training corpus.
            Results:
            For PICO sentence classification, BERT models using all pre-trained modules achieved an F1 score over 80%, and models pre-trained on PubMed abstracts achieved the highest F1 of 85%. For PICO entity recognition, fine-tuning BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts achieved an overall F1 of 71%, and satisfactory F1 for Species (98%), Strain (70%), Intervention (70%) and Outcome (67%). The score of Induction and Comparator is less satisfactory, but F1 of Comparator can be improved to 50% by applying self-training.
            Conclusions:
            Our study indicates that of the approaches tested, BERT pre-trained on PubMed abstracts is the best for both PICO sentence classification and PICO entity recognition in the preclinical abstracts. Self-training yields better performance for identifying comparators and strains.

AB  - The goal of this review is to discuss how behavioral tests in mice relate to the pathological and neuropsychological features seen in human Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal progression of behavioral impairments in commonly used AD mouse models that contain mutations in amyloid precursor protein. We provide a brief overview of neuropathological changes seen in AD brain, and some of the clinical neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive deficits. This is followed by a critical assessment of behavioral tasks that are used in AD mice to model the cognitive changes seen in humans. Behavioral tests discussed include spatial memory tests (Morris water maze, radial arm water maze, Barnes maze), associative learning tasks (passive avoidance, fear conditioning), alternation tasks (Y-Maze/T-Maze), recognition memory tasks (Novel Object Recognition), attentional tasks (3 & 5 choice serial reaction time), set-shifting tasks, and reversal learning tasks. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these tests, and how they may correlate with clinical assessments in humans. Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in ten AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1(M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5xFAD and 3xTg-AD) are discussed. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression, and are useful tools to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.

Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in ten AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1(M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5xFAD and 3xTg-AD) are discussed. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression, and are useful tools to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.

AB  - The Morris water maze (MWM) is a commonly used task to assess hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in transgenic mouse models of disease, including neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the background strain of the mouse model used can have a substantial effect on the observed behavioral phenotype, with some strains exhibiting superior learning ability relative to others. To ensure differences between transgene negative and transgene positive mice can be detected, identification of a training procedure sensitive to the background strain is essential. Failure to tailor the MWM protocol to the background strain of the mouse model may lead to under- or over- training, thereby masking group differences in probe trials. Here, a MWM protocol tailored for use with the F1 FVB/N x 129S6 background is described. This is a frequently used background strain to study the age-dependent effects of mutant P301L tau (rTg(TauP301L)4510 mice) on the memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. Also described is a strategy to re-optimize, as dictated by the particular testing environment utilized.

AB  - The recent development of knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease provides distinct advantages over traditional transgenic mouse models that rely on over-expression of amyloid precursor protein. Two such knock-in models that have recently been widely adopted by Alzheimer’s researchers are the AppNL−F and AppNL−G−F mice. This study aimed to further characterise the behavioural phenotype and amyloid plaque distribution of AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F (C57BL/6J background) mice at six-months of age. An attempt to replicate a previous study that observed deficits in working memory in the Y-maze, showed no difference between AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F and wild-type mice. Further assessment of these mice using the novel object recognition test and Morris water maze also revealed no differences between AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F and wild-type mice. Despite a lack of demonstrated cognitive deficits, we report a reduction in locomotor/exploratory activity in an open field. Histological examination of AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F mice showed widespread distribution of amyloid plaques at this age. We conclude that whilst at six-months of age, memory deficits are not sufficiently robust to be replicated in varying environments, amyloid plaque burden is significant in AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F knock-in brain.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a devastating cognitive decline. The disease is identified pathologically by amyloid plaques composed of aggregated amyloid- peptide, neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated, hyperphosphorylated tau protein and neuron loss. While the disease was first described in 1906, transgenic mouse models for the study of Alzheimer's disease pathologies have only been available to scientists for fifteen years. Despite the generation of many different mouse models that develop amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, it has only been in recent years that mouse models demonstrating the two pathologies together have been made. Also, neuron loss has been difficult to achieve in many models. Most recently, several transgenic mouse lines have been generated that do demonstrate all three pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease: amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuron loss. This review will focus on the advances made in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathology using the transgenic mouse models. It will also discuss the limitations associated with studying some of these mice and how transgenic mouse models have contributed to the development of therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Abstract
            Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease. Despite decades of clinical trials, effective disease-modifying drugs remain scarce. To understand the challenges of trial design and delivery, we performed a systematic review of Phase II, Phase II/III and Phase III amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical drug trials on trial registries and PubMed between 2008 and 2019. We identified 125 trials, investigating 76 drugs and recruiting more than 15 000 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. About 90% of trials used traditional fixed designs. The limitations in understanding of disease biology, outcome measures, resources and barriers to trial participation in a rapidly progressive, disabling and heterogenous disease hindered timely and definitive evaluation of drugs in two-arm trials. Innovative trial designs, especially adaptive platform trials may offer significant efficiency gains to this end. We propose a flexible and scalable multi-arm, multi-stage trial platform where opportunities to participate in a clinical trial can become the default for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Objective To examine whether the association of inadequate or unclear allocation concealment and lack of blinding with biased estimates of intervention effects varies with the nature of the intervention or outcome.Design Combined analysis of data from three meta-epidemiological studies based on collections of meta-analyses.Data sources 146 meta-analyses including 1346 trials examining a wide range of interventions and outcomes.Main outcome measures Ratios of odds ratios quantifying the degree of bias associated with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment, and lack of blinding, for trials with different types of intervention and outcome. A ratio of odds ratios <1 implies that inadequately concealed or non-blinded trials exaggerate intervention effect estimates.Results In trials with subjective outcomes effect estimates were exaggerated when there was inadequate or unclear allocation concealment (ratio of odds ratios 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.82)) or lack of blinding (0.75 (0.61 to 0.93)). In contrast, there was little evidence of bias in trials with objective outcomes: ratios of odds ratios 0.91 (0.80 to 1.03) for inadequate or unclear allocation concealment and 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10) for lack of blinding. There was little evidence for a difference between trials of drug and non-drug interventions. Except for trials with all cause mortality as the outcome, the magnitude of bias varied between meta-analyses.Conclusions The average bias associated with defects in the conduct of randomised trials varies with the type of outcome. Systematic reviewers should routinely assess the risk of bias in the results of trials, and should report meta-analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias either as the primary analysis or in conjunction with less restrictive analyses.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prominent neurodegenerative disease in aging societies. AD pathogenesis includes neuritic dystrophy synapse loss microgliosis astrogliosis and cognitive impairment. The major pathogenic hallmarks of AD include extracellular amyloid plaques intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and neuroinflammation. In the past two decades only drugs targeting neurotransmission pathways with limited therapeutic effects are available for the treatment of AD. The latest FDA-approved medicine for AD is Aduhelm a human antibody that targets toxic beta-amyloid proteins. In addition to mAbs against amyloid or Tau new targets are urgently needed. Another major pathological feature of AD is energy dysfunction associated with mitochondrial impairment and reduced ATP production. Consistent with this notion overactivation of a homeostatic energy sensor (AMP kinase AMPK) and abnormal purine metabolism have been observed in the brain of patients with AD. Targeting the purine metabolism and adenosine homeostasis thus become a new strategy for the development of AD treatment. Objective(s): We set out to investigate whether modulating adenosine homeostasis through the suppression of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) a bidirectional transporter in the brain using an orally active small compound (J4) impacts AD pathology. Method(s): Two AD mouse models (APP/PS1 and THY-Tau22) with onset of memory deficiency occurring at the age of 6 months were tested. for the purpose of disease prevention animals were treated with J4 (3 mg/kg/day) in drinking water containing 1% HPbetaCD from the age of 3 months for 7 months. For the therapeutic treatment mice were treated with J4 at the late disease stage (10-12 months old) as abovementioned for one month. The cognitive function of AD mice and their littermate controls were examined using the Morris water maze task followed by biochemical and pathological analyses (including positron emission tomography immunofluorescence staining western blot analysis RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR). Result(s): Our results showed that treatment with J4 improved the impaired memory functions and the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in AD mice (APP/PS1 and THY-Tau22 respectively). In addition defects of multiple pathways associated with AD pathogenesis (including mitochondrial dysfunction synaptic loss and elevated immune-related gene signatures) were also normalized by J4. Conclusion(s): Data of the present study showed that oral administration of J4 provided both preventive and therapeutic effects against AD pathology supporting that targeting adenosine metabolism is a novel and effective strategy for AD.

AB  - Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregated forms are highly associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ abnormally accumulates in the brain and induces neuronal damages and symptoms of AD such as cognitive impairment and memory loss. Since an antibody drug aducanumab reduces Aβ aggregates and delays clinical decline clearance of accumulated Aβ in the brain is accounted as a therapeutic approach to treat AD. In this study we synthesized 17 benzofuran derivatives that may disaggregate Aβ oligomers and plaques into inert monomers. By a series of Aβ aggregation inhibition and aggregates' disaggregation assays utilizing thioflavin T assays and gel electrophoresis YB-9 2-((5-methoxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzofuran-6-yl)oxy)acetic acid was selected as the final Aβ-disaggregator candidate. When it was orally administered to the 8-month-old male transgenic mouse model with five familial AD mutations (5XFAD) via drinking water daily for two months Aβ oligomers and plaques in hippocampus were reduced. Consequently decreased astrogliosis and rescued synaptic dysfunction were observed in the hippocampus of YB-9-treated 5XFAD mice compared with the untreated transgenic control group.

AB  - Scores of compounds ameliorate cognitive deficits or neuropathology in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet these triumphs in mice have not translated into successful therapies for people. Why have studies in mice failed to predict results of human trials? We argue that most transgenic mouse ‘models of AD’ actually simulate the asymptomatic phase of the disease, and the results of interventional studies in these mice should be considered in the context of disease prevention. In addition, recent advances in imaging technology and biomarker discovery should aid in comparisons of mouse and human neurological status and, importantly, might allow us to predict better the response of people to drugs tested in mice.

AB  - For many chronic diseases, translational success using the animal model paradigm has reached an impasse. Using Alzheimer’s disease as an example, this review employs a networks-based method to assess repeatability of outcomes across species, by intervention and mechanism. Over 75% of animal studies reported an improved outcome. Strain background was a significant potential confounder. Five percent of interventions had been tested across animals and humans, or examined across three or more animal models. Positive outcomes across species emerged for donepezil, memantine and exercise. Repeatable positive outcomes in animals were identified for the amyloid hypothesis and three additional mechanisms. This approach supports in silico reduction of positive outcomes bias in animal studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present work aims to evaluate the significance of sleep disturbance and electroencephalogram (EEG) alteration in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Sleep disturbance is common in patients with AD. It is not known if it can occur at the early stage of AD and if EEG recording may help identify the early sign of the disease. HISTORICAL EVOLUTION: Sleep disturbance in AD has generally been considered as late consequence of the neurodegenerative process. A growing body of evidence has suggested that the sleep disturbance may occur at the early stage of AD. UPDATED HYPOTHESIS: Based on the previous epidemiologic studies and our recent findings, we propose that sleep disturbance may play an important role in the development of AD. Sleep EEG changes may serve as a valuable early sign for AD in the prepathological stage. EARLY EXPERIMENTAL DATA: Our data suggested that AbetaPP(swe)/PS1(DeltaE9) transgenic AD mice at preplaque stage (3 and 4 months of age) exhibited different profile of sleep architecture and sleep EEG, which preceded the cognitive deficit and AD neuropathology. FUTURE EXPERIMENTS AND VALIDATION STUDIES: Future experiments should focus on sleep EEG changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early stage of AD. Follow-up studies in high-risk population of the elderly are equally important. In addition, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the sleep disturbance should be thoroughly investigated. MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: Studies on human participants with early stage of AD, especially the follow-up studies on the presymptomatic elderly in a large population, are difficult and time-consuming. LINKAGE TO OTHER MAJOR THEORIES: Our hypothesis may link previous theories to establish a bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and AD, which may finally form a new schematic mechanism to understand the disease pathogenesis and disease progression.

AB  - The amyloid precursor protein (APP) takes a central position in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis: APP processing generates the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are deposited as the amyloid plaques in brains of AD individuals; Point mutations and duplications of APP are causal for a subset of early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Not surprisingly, the production and pathogenic effect of Aβ has been the central focus in AD field. Nevertheless, the biological properties of APP have also been the subject of intense investigation since its identification nearly 20 years ago as it demonstrates a number of interesting putative physiological roles. Several attractive models of APP function have been put forward recently based on in vitro biochemical studies. Genetic analyses of gain- and loss-of-function mutants in Drosophila and mouse have also revealed important insights into its biological activities in vivo. This article will review the current understanding of APP physiological functions.

AB  - Sleep, in addition to its brain restorative processes, plays an important role in memory transfer from its temporary store in the hippocampus to the more permanent storage in the neocortex. Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects memory and sleep. The aim of this study was to explore disturbances in global and local synchrony patterns between brain regions in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the AD during natural sleep. We used 8 male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and 6 wild-type littermates, aged 5-6 months, with multiple electrode bundles implanted into cortical regions, thalamus and hippocampus. We measured video-EEG in freely moving animals and analyzed synchrony during NREM vs REM sleep. Global synchrony between medial frontal cortex and hippocampus measured with magnitude-squared coherence was slightly decreased in delta range during NREM stage of sleep in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, local hippocampal synchrony measured with cross-frequency coupling remained intact. Ripple structure or frequency did not differ between the genotypes. However, the coupling of the spindle-band power peak in the medial prefrontal cortex to hippocampal ripples was significantly decreased compared to wild-type animals. The delicate timing of hippocampal ripples, frontal delta, and corticothalamic spindle oscillations may be the first sign of impaired memory in amyloid plaque-forming transgenic mice.

AB  - The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel is a well recognized polymodal signal detector that is activated by painful stimuli such as capsaicin. Here, we show that TRPV1 is expressed in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). Despite the fact that the central amygdala displays the highest neuronal density, the highest density of TRPV1 labeled neurons was found within the nuclei of the basolateral complex of the amygdala. Capsaicin specifically changed the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the LA in brain slices of mice depending on the anesthetic (ether, isoflurane) used before euthanasia. After ether anesthesia, capsaicin had a suppressive effect on LA-LTP both in patch clamp and in extracellular recordings. The capsaicin-induced reduction of LTP was completely blocked by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME and was absent in neuronal NOS as well as in TRPV1 deficient mice. The specific antagonist of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), AM 251, was also able to reduce the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on LA-LTP, suggesting that stimulation of TRPV1 provokes the generation of anandamide in the brain which seems to inhibit NO synthesis. After isoflurane anesthesia before euthanasia capsaicin caused a TRPV1-mediated increase in the magnitude of LA-LTP. Therefore, our results also indicate that the appropriate choice of the anesthetics used is an important consideration when brain plasticity and the action of endovanilloids will be evaluated. In summary, our results demonstrate that TRPV1 may be involved in the amygdala control of learning mechanisms.

AB  - Deficiency in cerebral amyloid β-protein (Aβ) clearance is implicated in the pathogenesis of the common late-onset forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accumulation of misfolded Aβ in the brain is believed to be a net result of imbalance between its production and removal. This in turn may trigger neuroinflammation, progressive synaptic loss, and ultimately cognitive decline. Clearance of cerebral Aβ is a complex process mediated by various systems and cell types, including vascular transport across the blood–brain barrier, glymphatic drainage, and engulfment and degradation by resident microglia and infiltrating innate immune cells. Recent studies have highlighted a new, unexpected role for peripheral monocytes and macrophages in restricting cerebral Aβ fibrils, and possibly soluble oligomers. In AD transgenic (ADtg) mice, monocyte ablation or inhibition of their migration into the brain exacerbated Aβ pathology, while blood enrichment with monocytes and their increased recruitment to plaque lesion sites greatly diminished Aβ burden. Profound neuroprotective effects in ADtg mice were further achieved through increased cerebral recruitment of myelomonocytes overexpressing Aβ-degrading enzymes. This review summarizes the literature on cellular and molecular mechanisms of cerebral Aβ clearance with an emphasis on the role of peripheral monocytes and macrophages in Aβ removal.

AB  - A locus segregating with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been mapped to chromosome 21, close to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. Recombinants between the APP gene and the AD locus have been reported which seemed to exclude it as the site of the mutation causing familial AD. But recent genetic analysis of a large number of AD families has demonstrated that the disease is heterogeneous. Families with late-onset AD do not show linkage to chromosome 21 markers. Some families with early-onset AD show linkage to chromosome 21 markers, but some do not. This has led to the suggestion that there is non-allelic genetic heterogeneity even within early onset familial AD. To avoid the problems that heterogeneity poses for genetic analysis, we have examined the cosegregation of AD and markers along the long arm of chromosome 21 in a single family with AD confirmed by autopsy. Here we demonstrate that in this kindred, which shows linkage to chromosome 21 markers, there is a point mutation in the APP gene. This mutation causes an amino-acid substitution (Val----Ile) close to the carboxy terminus of the beta-amyloid peptide. Screening other cases of familial AD revealed a second unrelated family in which this variant occurs. This suggests that some cases of AD could be caused by mutations in the APP gene.

AB  - This study examined the role of sleep problems in the decisions of families to institutionalize elderly relatives. Previous work on institutionalization of the elderly has given little attention to the contribution of nocturnal, sleep-related problems. Seventy-three primary caregivers of elders recently admitted to a nursing home or psychiatric hospital were asked to identify the problems the elder was having during the night and day and rate the degree to which these influenced their decision to institutionalize the elder. Seventy percent of the caregivers in each sample cited nocturnal problems in their decision to institutionalize, often because their own sleep was disrupted. The most frequent disruptive nocturnal events were micturition, pain, and complaints of sleeplessness. Sleep problems of the elderly contribute heavily to the decision to institutionalize an elder and thus to the social and economic cost of institutional care. They appear to do this largely by interfering with the sleep of caregivers. The nature, prevalence, and treatability of the sleeping problems of both elders and their caregivers need further study.

AB  - A mutation at codon 717 of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene has been found to cosegregate with familial Alzheimer's disease in a single family. This mutation has been reported in a further five out of approximately 100 families multiply affected by Alzheimer's disease. We have identified another family, F19, in which we have detected linkage between the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene and Alzheimer's disease. Direct sequencing of exon 17 in affected individuals from this family has revealed a base change producing a Val----Gly substitution, also at codon 717. The occurrence of a second allelic variant at codon 717 linked to the Alzheimer's phenotype supports the hypothesis that they are pathogenic mutations.

AB  - Although awareness of Alzheimer's disease has increased strikingly among professional and lay audiences, precise means do not exist to calculate how many Americans the disease affects. Projecting data from a cohort of 32,000 individuals in a defined community in the United States, however, suggests that there were 2.88 million persons aged 65 or older with probable Alzheimer's disease in 1980. Using U.S. Census Bureau middle series projections yields an estimated total of 10.3 million persons with the disease for the year 2050. Limitations on these estimates notwithstanding, the projections indicate that more studies are needed to identify the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, its incidence, and the future costs of relevant institutional and community care.

AB  - A monoclonal antibody to the microtubule-associated protein tau (tau) labeled some neurofibrillary tangles and plaque neurites, the two major locations of paired-helical filaments (PHF), in Alzheimer disease brain. The antibody also labeled isolated PHF that had been repeatedly washed with NaDodSO4. Dephosphorylation of the tissue sections with alkaline phosphatase prior to immunolabeling dramatically increased the number of tangles and plaques recognized by the antibody. The plaque core amyloid was not stained in either dephosphorylated or nondephosphorylated tissue sections. On immunoblots PHF polypeptides were labeled readily only when dephosphorylated. In contrast, a commercially available monoclonal antibody to a phosphorylated epitope of neurofilaments that labeled the tangles and the plaque neurites in tissue did not label any PHF polypeptides on immunoblots. The PHF polypeptides, labeled with the monoclonal antibody to tau, electrophoresed with those polypeptides recognized by antibodies to isolated PHF. The antibody to tau-labeled microtubules from normal human brains assembled in vitro but identically treated Alzheimer brain preparations had to be dephosphorylated to be completely recognized by this antibody. These findings suggest that tau in Alzheimer brain is an abnormally phosphorylated protein component of PHF.

AB  - It has been suggested that the physical basis for dementia is structural or functional loss of synapses. To confirm this finding, we performed an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody (EP10) to a synaptophysin-like protein in brain samples from 45 prospectively studied elderly subjects with an average age of 83.3 +/- 10.1 years. We compared the synaptic marker to immunoreactivity with a newly developed PHF antibody (TG3). The cases were selected on the basis of availability of frozen tissue, and included subjects ranging from clinically normal to end-stage dementia. As an initial assessment, we determined Pearson product moment correlations for two clinical measures--the Blessed test of information, concentration, and memory (BICM) and the Fuld object Memory Evaluation (FOME)--with ELISA data and with traditional pathologic markers. We found strong correlations (p < 0.01-0.001) for BICM with brain weight, neuronal loss in the basal nucleus of Meynert (nbM), counts of senile plaques (SP) in the neocortex and hippocampus, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in all areas except the parahippocampal cortex. Except in the occipital lobe, where paired helical filament changes are relatively uncommon, TG3-immunoreactivity also correlated strongly with BICM. Weak correlations (p < 0.05) were found for BICM with EP10-immunoreactivity in only the temporal and parietal lobes. Only the pathologic variables showed any significant correlations with FOME. Because inclusion of normal subjects with few or no pathologic lesions could have been driving the strong correlations with pathologic markers, we limited the analysis to those subjects with dementia (BICM; 8). After making this correction, EP10-immunoreactivity in all cortical areas and the hippocampus correlated better (p < 0.05-0.01) with BICM but not FOME. The present univariate analysis suggests that synaptic markers may not be the best structural correlate of dementia and that markers indicative of cytoskeletal changes, e.g., SP, NFT and PHF protein accumulation, may be better correlates of dementia in the elderly.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive intellectual failure in aged humans. AD brains contain numerous amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites, and show profound synaptic loss, neurofibrillary tangle formation and gliosis. The amyloid plaques are composed of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta), a 40-42-amino-acid fragment of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). A primary pathogenic role for APP/A beta is suggested by missense mutations in APP that are tightly linked to autosomal dominant forms of AD. A major obstacle to elucidating and treating AD has been the lack of an animal model. Animals transgenic for APP have previously failed to show extensive AD-type neuropathology, but we now report the production of transgenic mice that express high levels of human mutant APP (with valine at residue 717 substituted by phenylalanine) and which progressively develop many of the pathological hallmarks of AD, including numerous extracellular thioflavin S-positive A beta deposits, neuritic plaques, synaptic loss, astrocytosis and microgliosis. These mice support a primary role for APP/A beta in the genesis of AD and could provide a preclinical model for testing therapeutic drugs.

Neuropathology confirmed the clinical diagnosis of AD. Genealogical investigations have confirmed that the two families are related to common founders. Two-point linkage analysis of the mutation versus the disease in the revised pedigree now gives a lod score of 7.62.

AB  - Alterations of the cerebral microvasculature have been reported in aging and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact role of microvascular alterations in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration remains unknown. In the present report, the cerebral cortex microvasculature was studied by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against vascular heparan sulfate proteoglycan protein core in normal aging controls. Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Guam amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonian dementia complex, Pick's disease and dementia pugilistica. In all dementing illnesses, increased microvascular pathology was evident compared to normal controls. Decreased microvascular density and numerous atrophic vessels were the primary abnormalities observed in all dementing disorders. These microvascular abnormalities demonstrated regional and laminar selectivity, and were primarily found in layers III and V of frontal and temporal cortex. Quantitative analysis employing computer-assisted microscopy demonstrated that the decrease in microvascular density in Alzheimer's disease was statistically significant compared to age-matched controls. In addition, extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan deposits were observed which colocalized with thioflavine S-positive senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome and selected Guam dementia cases. In some cases, heparan sulfate proteoglycan was seen in senile plaques that appeared to be diffuse or primitive plaques that stained weakly with thioflavine. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan-containing neurons were also observed in Alzheimer's disease, as well as in Down syndrome and Guam cases. Glial staining for heparan sulfate proteoglycan was never observed. Our data support previous observations that microvascular pathology is found in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. The changes in Alzheimer's disease exceed those found in normal aging controls. We also found microvascular pathology in all other dementing disorders studied. Our studies further demonstrated that the microvascular pathology displays regional and laminar patterns which parallel patterns of neuronal loss. Finally, we also found that heparan sulfate proteoglycan is present in senile plaques and neurons not only as previously reported in Alzheimer's disease, but also in Down syndrome and Guam cases. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan in senile plaques may be derived from either the degenerating microvasculature or from degenerating neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - A major component of amyloid deposits found in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome is the beta/A4 peptide, which is derived from the Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor (APP). Recent evidence indicates that increases in APP expression and/or beta/A4 peptide accumulation may underlie the amyloidosis characteristic of these diseases. In the present study, transgenic mice carrying the entire human APP gene were studied for expression of human APP. Significant expression of human APP protein was observed in these animals, and this expression paralleled the expression of endogenous APP. These results, which represent a first demonstration of significant human APP expression in transgenic animals, support the use of such animals to study human APP expression and processing in vivo and possibly as models for the amyloidosis associated with Alzheimer disease.

AB  - Transgenic mice overexpressing the 695-amino acid isoform of human Alzheimer beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein containing a Lys670 --> Asn, Met671 --> Leu mutation had normal learning and memory in spatial reference and alternation tasks at 3 months of age but showed impairment by 9 to 10 months of age. A fivefold increase in Abeta(1-40) and a 14-fold increase in Abeta(1-42/43) accompanied the appearance of these behavioral deficits. Numerous Abeta plaques that stained with Congo red dye were present in cortical and limbic structures of mice with elevated amounts of Abeta. The correlative appearance of behavioral, biochemical, and pathological abnormalities reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease in these transgenic mice suggests new opportunities for exploring the pathophysiology and neurobiology of this disease.

AB  - Missense mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) co-segregate with a small subset of autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) cases wherein deposition of the 39-43 amino acid beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide and neurodegeneration are principal neuropathological hallmarks. To accurately examine the effect of missense mutations on APP metabolism and A beta production in vivo, we have introduced yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing the entire approximately 400 kbp human APP gene encoding APP harboring either the asparagine for lysine and leucine for methionine FAD substitution at codons 670 and 671 (APP(K670N/M671L)), the isoleucine for valine FAD substitution at codon 717 (APP(V7171)) or a combination of both substitutions into transgenic mice. We demonstrate that, relative to YAC transgenic mice expressing wild-type APP, high levels of A beta peptides are detected in the brains of YAC transgenic mice expressing human APP(K670N/M671L) that is associated with a concomitant diminution in the levels of apha-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives. Moreover, the levels of longer A beta peptides (species terminating at amino acids 42/43) are elevated in YAC transgenic mice expressing human APP(V7171). These mice should prove valuable for detailed analysis of the in vivo effects of the APP FAD mutations in a variety of tissues and throughout aging and for testing therapeutic agents that specifically alter APP metabolism and A beta production.

AB  - Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene cause early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (AD) by affecting the formation of the amyloid beta (A beta) peptide, the major constituent of AD plaques. We expressed human APP751 containing these mutations in the brains of transgenic mice. Two transgenic mouse lines develop pathological features reminiscent of AD. The degree of pathology depends on expression levels and specific mutations. A 2-fold overexpression of human APP with the Swedish double mutation at positions 670/671 combined with the V717I mutation causes A beta deposition in neocortex and hippocampus of 18-month-old transgenic mice. The deposits are mostly of the diffuse type; however, some congophilic plaques can be detected. In mice with 7-fold overexpression of human APP harboring the Swedish mutation alone, typical plaques appear at 6 months, which increase with age and are Congo Red-positive at first detection. These congophilic plaques are accompanied by neuritic changes and dystrophic cholinergic fibers. Furthermore, inflammatory processes indicated by a massive glial reaction are apparent. Most notably, plaques are immunoreactive for hyperphosphorylated tau, reminiscent of early tau pathology. The immunoreactivity is exclusively found in congophilic senile plaques of both lines. In the higher expressing line, elevated tau phosphorylation can be demonstrated biochemically in 6-month-old animals and increases with age. These mice resemble major features of AD pathology and suggest a central role of A beta in the pathogenesis of the disease.

AB  - Genetic causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes. The mutant APP(K670N,M671L) transgenic line, Tg2576, shows markedly elevated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) levels at an early age and, by 9-12 months, develops extracellular AD-type A beta deposits in the cortex and hippocampus. Mutant PS1 transgenic mice do not show abnormal pathology, but do display subtly elevated levels of the highly amyloidogenic 42- or 43-amino acid peptide A beta42(43). Here we demonstrate that the doubly transgenic progeny from a cross between line Tg2576 and a mutant PS1M146L transgenic line develop large numbers of fibrillar A beta deposits in cerebral cortex and hippocampus far earlier than their singly transgenic Tg2576 littermates. In the period preceding overt A beta deposition, the doubly transgenic mice show a selective 41% increase in A beta42(43) in their brains. Thus, the development of AD-like pathology is substantially enhanced when a PS1 mutation, which causes a modest increase in A beta42(43), is introduced into Tg2576-derived mice. Remarkably, both doubly and singly transgenic mice showed reduced spontaneous alternation performance in a "Y" maze before substantial A beta deposition was apparent. This suggests that some aspects of the behavioral phenotype in these mice may be related to an event that precedes plaque formation.

AB  - Autosomal dominant forms of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are associated with increased production of the amyloid beta peptide, Abeta42, which is derived from the amyloid protein precursor (APP). In FAD, as well as in sporadic forms of the illness, Abeta peptides accumulate abnormally in the brain in the form of amyloid plaques. Here, we show that overexpression of FAD(717V-->F)-mutant human APP in neurons of transgenic mice decreases the density of presynaptic terminals and neurons well before these mice develop amyloid plaques. Electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampus revealed prominent deficits in synaptic transmission, which also preceded amyloid deposition by several months. Although in young mice, functional and structural neuronal deficits were of similar magnitude, functional deficits became predominant with advancing age. Increased Abeta production in the context of decreased overall APP expression, achieved by addition of the Swedish FAD mutation to the APP transgene in a second line of mice, further increased synaptic transmission deficits in young APP mice without plaques. These results suggest a neurotoxic effect of Abeta that is independent of plaque formation.

AB  - There are numerous methods available for assessing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other forms of dementia. Quality-of-life (QOL) assessment is unique among these methods, because the QOL concept itself includes a subjective component that is fundamental to its measurement. It could be argued that measuring quality of life is just as important as measuring disease severity, disease progression, symptom response, cognition, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living when assessing the impact of disease and intervention in dementia. The subjective nature of quality of life provides healthcare professionals with the opportunity of incorporating the value systems of patients and their carers into their assessments. A systematic review was carried out to include the published data (and some unpublished data) on QOL assessment tools and instruments that claim to measure quality of life in dementia. Literature for this review was identified by a thorough search of computer databases (1980-1997) that included Medline, Embase, PsychLit and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Reports concerning the conceptualisation, development, validation, reliability, reproducibility, comprehensiveness, practicality and use of QOL instruments in dementia/AD were selected for review as well as papers documenting clinical drug trials in this therapeutic area. A number of measures or methods used in the literature for assessing the quality of life of patients with dementing illnesses were identified. It was decided to present the resulting review in 2 parts that correspond to the 2 main groups into which the instruments were categorised. The first (part 1) looks at measures used to assess the impact of disease as well as instruments at a developmental or testing stage. The second (part 2) includes instruments that claim to measure quality of life in studies documenting the impact of a drug in this therapeutic area. There are as yet no validated methods of assessing the quality of life of both patients with dementia and their carers at the same time. QOL outcomes for these 2 groups is closely, if not fundamentally, linked and yet most studies identified in this review concentrate on measuring the quality of life of either the patient or the carer alone. Although some researchers may be getting close conceptually, an instrument has yet to satisfy all the criteria necessary to become accepted as a gold standard for QOL assessment in dementing illness. The ideal instrument must show that it can reliably, reproducibly and comprehensively assess quality of life for patients with dementia and their carers. It should also demonstrate that it can measure quality of life effectively using a practical administration technique that does not place any unnecessary burden on either informal carers, other healthcare workers involved or the patient themselves. Further cross-sectional and longitudinal research is required to psychometrically test the available instruments as well as continuing conceptual research to explore new ways of assessing quality of life in this important area.

AB  - Genetic evidence strongly supports the view that Abeta amyloid production is central to the cause of Alzheimer's disease. The kinetics, compartmentation, and form of Abeta and its temporal relation to the neurodegenerative process remain uncertain. The levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta were determined by using western blot techniques, and the findings were assessed in relation to indices of severity of disease. The mean level of soluble Abeta is increased threefold in Alzheimer's disease and correlates highly with markers of disease severity. In contrast, the level of insoluble Abeta (also a measure of total amyloid load) is found only to discriminate Alzheimer's disease from controls, and does not correlate with disease severity or numbers of amyloid plaques. These findings support the concept of several interacting pools of Abeta, that is, a large relatively static insoluble pool that is derived from a constantly turning over smaller soluble pool. The latter may exist in both intracellular and extracellular compartments, and contain the basic forms of Abeta that cause neurodegeneration. Reducing the levels of these soluble Abeta species by threefold to levels found in normal controls might prove to be a goal of future therapeutic intervention.

AB  - We have studied synaptic function in a transgenic mouse strain relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD), overexpressing the 695 amino acid isoform of human amyloid precursor protein with K670N and M671L mutations (APP(695)SWE mice), which is associated with early-onset familial AD. Aged-transgenic mice had substantially elevated levels of Abeta (up to 22 micromol/gm) and displayed characteristic Abeta plaques. Hippocampal slices from 12-month-old APP(695)SWE transgenic animals displayed reduced levels of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region when compared with wild-type littermate controls. Inclusion of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate during preparation of brain slices abolished this deficit. At 18 months of age, a selective deficit in basal synaptic transmission was observed in the CA1 region despite treatment with kynurenate. Paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation (LTP) were normal in APP(695)SWE transgenic mice at both 12 and 18 months of age. Thus, although aged APP(695)SWE transgenic mice have greatly elevated levels of Abeta protein, increased numbers of plaques, and reduced basal synaptic transmission, LTP can still be induced and expressed normally. We conclude that increased susceptibility to excitotoxicity rather than a specific effect on LTP is the primary cause of cognitive deficits in APP(695)SWE mice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the performance of several spectral indices of the EEG (ratios between fast and slow EEG activities) as descriptors of the EEG changes occurring at the onset and during the evolution of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These indices were calculated from quantitative analysis of EEGs recorded in AD patients and from a matched non-demented group of control subjects. One advantage of such indices is to be independent of the absolute value of power spectral densities, which may vary from subject to subject, another being to take into account fast EEG activities. Conventional statistic tests and Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) analysis were performed upon these data to determine the accuracy of the power ratios to discriminate a) between controls and patients (i.e., to detect dementia) and b) between subgroups of patients defined according to the Global Deterioration Scale of Reisberg (GDS). The defined ratios provided a good classification of AD patients for all cerebral regions except the frontal areas, because of eye movement artefacts; the results confirm the increase in slow activities and the concomitant decrease in fast activities early in AD patients. Moreover, our results demonstrate that these indices are adapted tools to perform a good discrimination between demented and non-demented patients in routine clinical practice. We therefore propose the use of these EEG power ratios to discriminate between different stages of Alzheimer's disease, and to perform long-term monitoring of AD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia treated in managed care organizations (MCOs) is increasing, and this trend is expected to continue. Therefore, it is critical that MCOs develop disease management strategies for this population. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the prevalence, costs, and treatment of AD and related dementia. STUDY DESIGN: Review of published articles from MEDLINE and peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: Prevalence of AD and related dementia is approximately 5.7% among those aged 65 and older. Prevalence data from claims-based studies of AD in managed care are lower, ranging from 0.55% to 0.83%. Costs for formal care average $27,672 per patient annually, with long-term care being the most costly component. Annual costs for informal care are estimated to be $10,400 to $34,517 per patient. Additional costs associated with AD include lost wages and productivity of patients and caregivers and costs associated with increased morbidity of caregivers. Donepezil treatment is well tolerated and has been extensively tested and evaluated in clinical settings. Early diagnosis and treatment of AD with donepezil has been shown to slow cognitive decline in AD. Although study findings regarding the cost offsets of donepezil-treated patients to date are mixed, there is a growing body of evidence to support the inclusion of this and other therapies into an MCO's AD treatment armamentarium. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that MCOs will escape the increased prevalence and costs associated with AD. Opportunities exist through patient management programs targeted toward early diagnosis, effective use of medications, control of comorbidities, and patient and family support to partially offset these costs while providing quality patient care.

AB  - The main objective of the present study was to develop an alternative singly-transgenic (tg) hAPP model where amyloid deposition will occur at an earlier age. For this purpose, we generated lines of tg mice expressing hAPP751 cDNA containing the London (V717I) and Swedish (K670M/N671L) mutations under the regulatory control of the murine (m)Thy-1 gene (mThy1-hAPP751). In the brains of the highest (line 41) and intermediate (lines 16 and 11) expressers, high levels of hAPP expression were found in neurons in layers 4-5 of the neocortex, hippocampal CA1 and olfactory bulb. As early as 3-4 months of age, line 41 mice developed mature plaques in the frontal cortex, whereas at 5-7 months plaque formation extended to the hippocampus, thalamus and olfactory region. Ultrastructural and double-immunolabeling analysis confirmed that most plaques were mature and contained dystrophic neurites immunoreactive with antibodies against APP, synaptophysin, neurofilament and tau. In addition, a decrease in the number of synaptophysin-immunoreactive terminals was most prominent in the frontal cortex of mice from line 41. Mice from line 11 developed diffuse amyloid deposits at 11 months of age, whereas mice from line 16 did not show evidence of amyloid deposition. Analysis of Abeta by ELISA showed that levels of Abeta(1-40) were higher in mice that did not show any amyloid deposits (line 16), whereas Abeta(1-42) was the predominant species in tg animals from the lines showing plaque formation (lines 41 and 11). Taken together this study indicates that early onset plaque formation depends on levels of Abeta(1-42).

AB  - Recent advances in behavioral analyses of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are discussed, and their impact on our understanding of the molecular basis of cognitive impairment in AD is considered. Studies of the relationship between memory and A Beta in transgenic mice expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its variants suggest that aging promotes the formation of soluble A Beta assemblies mediating negative effects on memory. A significant component of memory loss in APP transgenic mice is apparently caused by soluble A Beta assemblies, but whether and how much of the dementia within individuals afflicted with AD is caused by these A Beta species is unclear. Future studies in composite transgenic mice developing amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and other AD pathology may allow for the determination of the relative contribution of A Beta and non-A Beta components to dementia.

AB  - Transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) have provided important new information about the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) histopathology. However, the molecular basis of memory loss in these mice is poorly understood. One of the major impediments has been the difficulty of distinguishing between age-dependent and age-independent behavioral changes. To address this issue we studied in parallel two lines of APP transgenic mice expressing comparable levels of mutant and wild-type human APP. This enabled us to identify age-independent behavioral deficits that were not specifically related to mutant APP expression. When mice with age-independent deficits were eliminated, we detected memory loss in transgenic mice expressing mutant APP (Tg2576 mice) starting at approximately 6 months, which coincided with the appearance of detergent-insoluble Abeta aggregates (Abeta(insol)). Genetically accelerating the formation of Abeta(insol) resulted in an earlier onset of memory decline. A facile interpretation of these results, namely that memory loss and Abeta(insol) were closely connected, was rejected when we extended our analysis to include older mice. No obvious correspondence between memory and Abeta(insol) was apparent in a combined group of old and young mice unless the mice were stratified by age, whereupon inverse correlations between memory and Abeta(insol) became evident. These results suggested that Abeta(insol) is a surrogate marker for small assemblies of Abeta that disrupt cognition and occur as intermediates during Abeta(insol) formation, and they are the first descriptive in vivo data supporting their role in impairing memory. These studies also provide a methodological framework within which to investigate these Abeta assemblies in vivo.

AB  - It has been more than 10 years since it was first proposed that the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be caused by deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in plaques in brain tissue. According to the amyloid hypothesis, accumulation of Abeta in the brain is the primary influence driving AD pathogenesis. The rest of the disease process, including formation of neurofibrillary tangles containing tau protein, is proposed to result from an imbalance between Abeta production and Abeta clearance.

AB  - Using a spatial-cueing paradigm, we assessed the ability of Alzheimer's disease patients, age-matched controls and younger participants to use cues to guide attention to the location indicated by the cue. In separate experiments, we attempted to isolate cues that attract attention automatically (exogenous cueing) and those that require the wilful movement of attention (endogenous cues). We found significant cueing effects for all three groups of participants for both types of cue. However, the group with Alzheimer's disease showed far greater cueing effects when using an exogenous cue, whilst no difference between group's ability to use the cue was found for the endogenous cue. No differences in cueing were found for either cue type as a function of normal ageing. We further tested whether the differences in cueing found in the group with Alzheimer's disease was due to a generalised slowing of function. After transforming the data to take account of the overall slowing of all responses in this group, we still found significant differences between this group and the control groups. We conclude that patients with Alzheimer's disease have an abnormality in automatic, but not controlled visuospatial attention.

AB  - CONTEXT: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be a precursor to dementia, at least in some cases. Dementia and MCI are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in clinical samples. Only 2 population-based studies exist of the prevalence of these symptoms in dementia, and none exist for MCI. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and MCI in a population-based study. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study derived from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3608 participants were cognitively evaluated using data collected longitudinally over 10 years and additional data collected in 1999-2000 in 4 US counties. Dementia and MCI were classified using clinical criteria and adjudicated by committee review by expert neurologists and psychiatrists. A total of 824 individuals completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); 362 were classified as having dementia, 320 as having MCI; and 142 did not meet criteria for MCI or dementia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on ratings on the NPI in the previous month and from the onset of cognitive symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 682 individuals with dementia or MCI, 43% of MCI participants (n = 138) exhibited neuropsychiatric symptoms in the previous month (29% rated as clinically significant) with depression (20%), apathy (15%), and irritability (15%) being most common. Among the dementia participants, 75% (n = 270) had exhibited a neuropsychiatric symptom in the past month (62% were clinically significant); 55% (n = 199) reported 2 or more and 44% (n = 159) 3 or more disturbances in the past month. In participants with dementia, the most frequent disturbances were apathy (36%), depression (32%), and agitation/aggression (30%). Eighty percent of dementia participants (n = 233) and 50% of MCI participants (n = 139) exhibited at least 1 NPI symptom from the onset of cognitive symptoms. There were no differences in prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms between participants with Alzheimer-type dementia and those with other dementias, with the exception of aberrant motor behavior, which was more frequent in Alzheimer-type dementia (5.4% vs 1%; P =.02). CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in the majority of persons with dementia over the course of the disease. These are the first population-based estimates for neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI, indicating a high prevalence associated with this condition as well. These symptoms have serious adverse consequences and should be inquired about and treated as necessary. Study of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the context of dementia may improve our understanding of brain-behavior relationships.

AB  - Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to be a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent research has examined the potential importance of soluble species of Abeta in synaptic dysfunction, long before fibrillary Abeta is deposited and neurodegenerative changes occur. Hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity are disrupted in transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein with early onset familial AD mutations, and in rats after exogenous application of synthetic Abeta both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, naturally produced soluble Abeta was shown to block the persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the intact hippocampus. Sub-nanomolar concentrations of oligomeric Abeta were sufficient to inhibit late LTP, pointing to a possible reason for the sensitivity of hippocampus-dependent memory to impairment in the early preclinical stages of AD. Having identified the active species of Abeta that can play havoc with synaptic plasticity, it is hoped that new ways of targeting early AD can be developed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been shown that human clinical trials that lack randomization (RND) or blinding (BLD) often overestimate the magnitude of treatment effects. However, no studies have evaluated the effect of RND and BLD on animal research. The authors' objectives were to determine the proportion of animal studies presented at a national academic emergency medicine meeting that utilize randomization, blinding, or both; and to determine whether failure to employ these techniques changes the likelihood of observing a difference between treatment groups. METHODS: Two trained researchers reviewed abstracts presented at the 1997-2001 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) annual meetings using a standard data collection sheet. Studies that used an animal or cell line, compared two or more study groups, and measured an effect caused by the intervention or drugs were included. Studies were classified as randomized (RND+) if any part of the experiment involved random assignment of subjects to treatment groups, blinded (BLD+) if any assessment of the outcome was made by an investigator blinded to treatment group, and outcome-positive (Outcome+) if any difference between the study groups met the author's definition of significant. Following the initial review, differences in classification were resolved by consensus. The association between outcome and study methodology (RND, BLD or both) was measured using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: A total of 2,592 studies were published as abstracts. Three hundred eighty-nine were animal studies, and 290 of these studies had two or more study groups. RND- and BLD- studies were more likely to be Outcome+ than RND+ or BLD+ studies (OR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.9 and OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.3 to 7.7, respectively). When studies that used both RND and BND were compared with studies that used neither, the OR for a positive study was 5.2 (95% CI = 2.0 to 13.5). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that animal studies that do not utilize RND and BLD are more likely to report a difference between study groups than studies that employ these methods.

AB  - The neuropathological correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. To study the interaction between Abeta and tau and their effect on synaptic function, we derived a triple-transgenic model (3xTg-AD) harboring PS1(M146V), APP(Swe), and tau(P301L) transgenes. Rather than crossing independent lines, we microinjected two transgenes into single-cell embryos from homozygous PS1(M146V) knockin mice, generating mice with the same genetic background. 3xTg-AD mice progressively develop plaques and tangles. Synaptic dysfunction, including LTP deficits, manifests in an age-related manner, but before plaque and tangle pathology. Deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta. These studies suggest a novel pathogenic role for intraneuronal Abeta with regards to synaptic plasticity. The recapitulation of salient features of AD in these mice clarifies the relationships between Abeta, synaptic dysfunction, and tangles and provides a valuable model for evaluating potential AD therapeutics as the impact on both lesions can be assessed.

AB  - Cerebrovascular deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a common pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. In particular, the Dutch E22Q and Iowa D23N mutations in Abeta cause familial cerebrovascular amyloidosis with abundant diffuse amyloid plaque deposits. Both of these charge-altering mutations enhance the fibrillogenic and pathogenic properties of Abeta in vitro. Here, we describe the generation of several transgenic mouse lines (Tg-SwDI) expressing human neuronal Abeta precursor protein (AbetaPP) harboring the Swedish K670N/M671L and vasculotropic Dutch/Iowa E693Q/D694N mutations under the control of the mouse Thy1.2 promoter. Tg-SwDI mice expressed transgenic human AbetaPP only in the brain, but at levels below those of endogenous mouse AbetaPP. Despite the paucity of human AbetaPP expression, quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements revealed that Tg-SwDI mice developed early-onset and robust accumulation of Abeta in the brain with high association with isolated cerebral microvessels. Tg-SwDI mice exhibited striking perivascular/vascular Abeta deposits that markedly increased with age. The vascular Abeta accumulations were fibrillar, exhibiting strong thioflavin S staining, and occasionally presented signs of microhemorrhage. In addition, numerous largely diffuse, plaque-like structures were observed starting at 3 months of age. In vivo transport studies demonstrated that Dutch/Iowa mutant Abeta was more readily retained in the brain compared with wild-type Abeta. These results with Tg-SwDI mice demonstrate that overexpression of human AbetaPP is not required for early-onset and robust accumulation of both vascular and parenchymal Abeta in mouse brain.

AB  - Anxiety is a widely studied psychiatric disorder and is thought to be a complex and multidimensional phenomenon. Sensitive behavioral discrimination of animal models of anxiety is crucial for the elucidation of the behavioral components of anxiety and the physiological processes that mediate them. Commonly used behavior paradigms of anxiety usually include only a few automatically collected measures; these do not exhaust the behavioral richness exhibited by animals, thus perhaps missing important differences between preparations. The aim of the present study was to expand the repertoire of automatically collected measures in a classical test of anxiety: behavior in relation to the wall in the open field. We present an algorithm, based on the Software for the Exploration of Exploration strategy, which automatically partitions the mouse path into intrinsically defined patterns of movement near the wall and in the center. These patterns are used to design new end points, which provide an articulated description of various aspects of behavior near the wall and in the center. Sixteen new end points were designed with data from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice tested in three laboratories. The strain differences in all end points were evaluated on another data set to assess their validity and were found to remain stable. Ten of the sixteen end points were found to discriminate between the two strains in a replicable manner. The entire set of end points can be used on various genetic and pharmacological models of anxiety with good prospects of providing fine discrimination in a replicable manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze sources searched in Cochrane reviews, to determine the proportion of trials included in reviews that are indexed in major databases, and to compare the quality of these trials with those from other sources. METHODS: All new systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library, Issue1 2001, that were restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were selected. The sources searched in the reviews were recorded, and the trials included were checked to see whether they were indexed in four major databases. Trials not indexed were checked to determine how they could be identified. The quality of trials found in major databases was compared with those found from other sources. RESULTS: The range in the number of databases searched per review ranged between one and twenty-seven. The proportion of the trials in the four databases were Cochrane Controlled Trials Register = 78.5%, MEDLINE = 68.8%, Embase = 65.0%, and Science/Social Sciences Citation Index = 60.7%. Searching another twenty-six databases after Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, and Embase only found 2.4% additional trials. There was no significant difference between trials found in the CCTR, MEDLINE, and Embase compared with other trials, with respect to adequate allocation concealment or sample size. CONCLUSIONS: There was a large variation between reviews in the exhaustiveness of the literature searches. CCTR was the single best source of RCTs. Additional database searching retrieved only a small percentage of extra trials. Contacting authors and manufacturers to find unpublished trials appeared to be a more effective method of obtaining the additional better quality trials.

AB  - One of the most clinically advanced forms of experimental disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer disease is immunization against the amyloid beta protein (Abeta), but how this may prevent cognitive impairment is unclear. We hypothesized that antibodies to Abeta could exert a beneficial action by directly neutralizing potentially synaptotoxic soluble Abeta species in the brain. Intracerebroventricular injection of naturally secreted human Abeta inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), a correlate of learning and memory, in rat hippocampus in vivo but a monoclonal antibody to Abeta completely prevented the inhibition of LTP when injected after Abeta. Size fractionation showed that Abeta oligomers, not monomers or fibrils, were responsible for inhibiting LTP, and an Abeta antibody again prevented such inhibition. Active immunization against Abeta was partially effective, and the effects correlated positively with levels of antibodies to Abeta oligomers. The ability of exogenous and endogenous antibodies to rapidly neutralize soluble Abeta oligomers that disrupt synaptic plasticity in vivo suggests that treatment with such antibodies might show reversible cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer disease.

AB  - The study examined odour identification ability in healthy older adults at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recruited a sample (n = 24) of siblings related to probable AD cases and an age-matched control sample (n = 47). All participants were genotyped for the presence of the ApoE epsilon4 allele. Performance on a simple olfactory task of odour identification was compared according to positive family history of AD and ApoE epsilon4 status. The sibling group showed an odour identification deficit compared to the control group. Whilst there was no independent influence of ApoE epsilon4 status on odour identification, there was a significant interaction between positive family history and ApoE epsilon4 status. Sibling epsilon4 carriers showed the greatest odour identification deficit and their performance was significantly poorer than both the sibling non-epsilon4 carrier and control epsilon4 carrier groups. Odour identification deficits like those reported here are considered to be early cognitive markers of incipient AD. In this respect, these findings support the need to both monitor individuals at increased risk of the disease and introduce olfactory-mediated cognitive tasks into the diagnostic setting.

AB  - One of the major neuropathological findings in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a loss of synaptic contacts in both the neocortex and hippocampus. Here we report, for the first time, an estimate of the total number of synapses in the outer molecular layer (OML) of the human dentate gyrus, in individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (eAD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or no cognitive impairment (NCI). An unbiased stereologic sampling scheme coupled with transmission electron microscopy to directly visualize synaptic contacts, was used to estimate the total number of synapses in short postmortem autopsy tissue. Individuals with eAD had significantly fewer synapses than the other two diagnostic groups. Seventy-five percent of the individuals with MCI had synaptic values that were lower than the NCI group mean. The number of synapses showed a significant correlation with the subject's Mini-Mental State score and with cognitive tests involving delayed recall. Synaptic loss showed no relationship to Braak stage or to apoE genotype. The volume of the OML was significantly reduced in eAD compared to the other two diagnositic groups that were not different from each other. These data suggest that a loss of afferents from the entorhinal cortex underlie the synapse loss seen in eAD. This study supports the concept that synapse loss is an early event in the disease process and suggests that MCI may be a transition stage between eAD and NCI with synaptic loss a structural correlate involved in cognitive decline.

AB  - It is widely thought that Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins as a malfunction of synapses, eventually leading to cognitive impairment and dementia. Homeostatic synaptic scaling is a mechanism that could be crucial at the onset of AD but has not been examined experimentally. In this process, the synaptic strength of a neuron is modified so that the overall excitability of the cell is maintained. Here, we investigate whether synaptic scaling mediated by l-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) contributes to pathology in double knockin (2 x KI) mice carrying human mutations in the genes for amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1. By using whole-cell recordings, we show that 2 x KI mice exhibit age-related downscaling of AMPAR-mediated evoked currents and spontaneous, miniature currents. Electron microscopic analysis further corroborates the synaptic AMPAR decrease. Additionally, 2 x KI mice show age-related deficits in bidirectional plasticity (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) and memory flexibility. These results suggest that AMPARs are important synaptic targets for AD and provide evidence that cognitive impairment may involve downscaling of postsynaptic AMPAR function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A relationship between brain atrophy and delta rhythmicity (1.5-4 Hz) has been previously explored in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects [Fernandez A, Arrazola J, Maestu F, Amo C, Gil-Gregorio P, Wienbruch C, Ortiz T. Correlations of hippocampal atrophy and focal low-frequency magnetic activity in Alzheimer disease: volumetric MR imaging-magnetoencephalographic study. Am J Neuroradiol. 2003 24(3):481-487]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that such a relationship does exist not only in AD patients but also across the continuum of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: Resting, eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 65 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by LORETA. Cortical EEG sources were correlated with MR-based measurements of lobar brain volume (white and gray matter). RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between the frontal white matter and the amplitude of frontal delta sources (2-4 Hz) across MCI and AD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed for the first time the hypothesis that the sources of resting delta rhythms (2-4 Hz) are correlated with lobar brain volume across MCI and AD subjects. SIGNIFICANCE: The present findings support, at least at group level, the 'transition hypothesis' of brain structural and functional continuity between MCI and AD.

AB  - Oxidative stress has long been associated with normal aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is now evident that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O(2-*)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) also play pivotal roles in normal cell signaling. The focus of the present study was to examine the effects of the antioxidant enzymes CuZnSOD (SOD1) and catalase, which produce and remove H(2)O(2), respectively, on long-term potentiation (LTP) forms of synaptic plasticity during aging. Consistent wth previous studies, LTP, when induced in vitro in CA1 of the hippocampus with a high-frequency stimulation protocol, is significantly reduced in slices from older mice (22-26 months) relative to younger mice (2-4 months). Neither knockout of the endogenous catalase gene (Cat KO) nor acute enzymatic treatment with SOD1 altered LTP in slices from adult mice. Conversely, enzymatic applications of SOD1 inhibited LTP in slices from older mice. A much different set of results emerges with exogenous applications of catalase to hippocampal slices. Catalase significantly inhibited LTP in slices from adult mice but reversed age-related LTP deficits in slices from older mice. Measurements of H(2)O(2) showed that exogenous treatments with catalase lowered H(2)O(2) in synapse-enriched synaptoneurosome (SN) fractions prepared from adult mice. Notably, SNs from both Cat KO and old mice were deficient in removing extracellular challenges of H(2)O(2). Overall, the results suggest that dynamic alterations in extracellular H(2)O(2) metabolism affect synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus during aging.

AB  - Although quantitative EEG (q-EEG) has been used in Alzheimer's disease (AD), q-EEG changes in AD are complex because of the progressive nature of this disease. The topographical spectral power and occipital peak frequency (OPF) were compared among elderly controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with four stages of AD. In AD patients, except those with a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score of 0.5, OPF was lower than that of elderly controls. Compared with elderly controls, the left anterior alpha spectral power was reduced in CDR 0.5; both posterior theta spectral powers were increased and all alpha spectral powers were reduced in CDR 1; all alpha and beta spectral powers were reduced and theta spectral power was increased in CDR 2; and all alpha and beta spectral powers were reduced and all delta and theta spectral powers were increased in CDR 3. Patients with MCI exhibited a reduction in both centrotemporal, posterior delta and left anterior, centrotemporal theta fields. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was related to left OPF, right posterior delta and left anterior theta spectral power, in that order. This study suggests that q-EEG in MCI shows nonoverlapping features between controls and AD patients, and AD patients show dynamic changes as the disease progresses. Finally, the left OPF is the parameter most significantly correlated with MMSE score.

AB  - Mutations in the genes for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins (PS1, PS2) increase production of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) and cause familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Transgenic mice that express FAD mutant APP and PS1 overproduce Abeta42 and exhibit amyloid plaque pathology similar to that found in AD, but most transgenic models develop plaques slowly. To accelerate plaque development and investigate the effects of very high cerebral Abeta42 levels, we generated APP/PS1 double transgenic mice that coexpress five FAD mutations (5XFAD mice) and additively increase Abeta42 production. 5XFAD mice generate Abeta42 almost exclusively and rapidly accumulate massive cerebral Abeta42 levels. Amyloid deposition (and gliosis) begins at 2 months and reaches a very large burden, especially in subiculum and deep cortical layers. Intraneuronal Abeta42 accumulates in 5XFAD brain starting at 1.5 months of age (before plaques form), is aggregated (as determined by thioflavin S staining), and occurs within neuron soma and neurites. Some amyloid deposits originate within morphologically abnormal neuron soma that contain intraneuronal Abeta. Synaptic markers synaptophysin, syntaxin, and postsynaptic density-95 decrease with age in 5XFAD brain, and large pyramidal neurons in cortical layer 5 and subiculum are lost. In addition, levels of the activation subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, p25, are elevated significantly at 9 months in 5XFAD brain, although an upward trend is observed by 3 months of age, before significant neurodegeneration or neuron loss. Finally, 5XFAD mice have impaired memory in the Y-maze. Thus, 5XFAD mice rapidly recapitulate major features of AD amyloid pathology and may be useful models of intraneuronal Abeta42-induced neurodegeneration and amyloid plaque formation.

STUDY SELECTION: Animal studies for interventions with unambiguous evidence of a treatment effect (benefit or harm) in clinical trials: head injury, antifibrinolytics in haemorrhage, thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke, tirilazad in acute ischaemic stroke, antenatal corticosteroids to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and bisphosphonates to treat osteoporosis. Review methods Data were extracted on study design, allocation concealment, number of randomised animals, type of model, intervention, and outcome. RESULTS: Corticosteroids did not show any benefit in clinical trials of treatment for head injury but did show a benefit in animal models (pooled odds ratio for adverse functional outcome 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.83). Antifibrinolytics reduced bleeding in clinical trials but the data were inconclusive in animal models. Thrombolysis improved outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke. In animal models, tissue plasminogen activator reduced infarct volume by 24% (95% confidence interval 20% to 28%) and improved neurobehavioural scores by 23% (17% to 29%). Tirilazad was associated with a worse outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke. In animal models, tirilazad reduced infarct volume by 29% (21% to 37%) and improved neurobehavioural scores by 48% (29% to 67%). Antenatal corticosteroids reduced respiratory distress and mortality in neonates whereas in animal models respiratory distress was reduced but the effect on mortality was inconclusive (odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 20.9). Bisphosphonates increased bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis. In animal models the bisphosphonate alendronate increased bone mineral density compared with placebo by 11.0% (95% confidence interval 9.2% to 12.9%) in the combined results for the hip region. The corresponding treatment effect in the lumbar spine was 8.5% (5.8% to 11.2%) and in the combined results for the forearms (baboons only) was 1.7% (-1.4% to 4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Discordance between animal and human studies may be due to bias or to the failure of animal models to mimic clinical disease adequately.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tirilazad is a candidate neuroprotective drug with reported efficacy in animal models of stroke that was, however, without benefit in clinical trials. This apparent contradiction might be explained if the animal studies were falsely positive, if the clinical trials were falsely negative, or if tirilazad was not tested under the same conditions in animal and clinical studies. Here we use systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the characteristics and limits to the neuroprotective action of tirilazad in animal models of stroke. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies describing the efficacy of tirilazad in animal models of focal ischemia, in which outcome was measured as infarct volume and/or neurological score. Weighted mean difference random effects meta-analysis was used to measure overall efficacy in prespecified subgroups. RESULTS: Eighteen studies describing outcome in 544 animals were identified. Study quality (median score, 5/10; interquartile range, 4 to 6) was similar to that seen in systematic reviews of other candidate neuroprotective drugs. Tirilazad reduced infarct volume by 29.2% (95% confidence interval 21.1% to 37.2%) and improved neurobehavioral score by 48.1% (95% confidence interval 29.3% to 66.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Tirilazad may have substantial efficacy in animal models of stroke, but this conclusion must be qualified because of the presence of potential sources of bias.

AB  - Converging lines of evidence suggest that progressive accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) plays a central role in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it was long assumed that A beta had to be assembled into extracellular amyloid fibrils to exert its cytotoxic effects. Over the past decade, data have emerged from the use of synthetic A beta peptides, cell culture models, beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice and human brain to suggest that pre-fibrillar, diffusible assemblies of A beta are also deleterious. Although the precise molecular identity of these soluble toxins remains unsettled, accumulating evidence suggests that soluble forms of A beta are indeed the proximate effectors of synapse loss and neuronal injury. Here we review recent progress in understanding the role of soluble oligomers in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Induced hypothermia is proposed as a treatment for acute ischaemic stroke, but there have been too few clinical trials involving too few patients to draw any conclusions about the therapeutic benefit of cooling. Animal studies of induced hypothermia in focal cerebral ischaemia have tested cooling throughout a wide range of target temperatures, durations and intervals between stroke onset and the initiation of hypothermia. These studies, therefore, provide an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment strategies in animal models to inform the design of future clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for efficacy of hypothermia in animal models of ischaemic stroke, and identified 101 publications reporting the effect of hypothermia on infarct size or functional outcome, including data from a total of 3353 animals. Overall, hypothermia reduced infarct size by 44% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40-47%]. Efficacy was highest with cooling to lower temperatures (< or =31 degrees C), where treatment was started before or at the onset of ischaemia and in temporary rather than permanent ischaemia models. However, a substantial reduction in infarct volume was also observed with cooling to 35 degrees C (30%; 95% CI, 21-39%), with initiation of treatment between 90 and 180 min (37%; 95% CI, 28-46%) and in permanent ischaemia models (37%; 95% CI, 30-43%). The effects of hypothermia on functional outcome were broadly similar. We conclude that in animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia, hypothermia improves outcome by about one-third under conditions that may be achievable for large numbers of patients with ischaemic stroke. Large randomized clinical trials testing the effect of hypothermia in patients with acute ischaemic stroke are warranted.

AB  - The development of stroke drugs has been characterized by success in animal studies and subsequent failure in clinical trials. Animal studies might have overstated efficacy, or clinical trials might have understated efficacy; in either case we need to better understand the reasons for failure. Techniques borrowed from clinical trials have recently allowed the impact of publication and study-quality biases on published estimates of efficacy in animal experiments to be described. On the basis of these data, we propose minimum standards for the range and quality of pre-clinical animal data. We believe the adoption of these standards will lead to improved effectiveness and efficiency in the selection of drugs for clinical trials in stroke and in the design of those trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Piracetam was a candidate neuroprotective drug for acute stroke ineffective in clinical trial. Here we use systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the evidence supporting a protective effect of piracetam and its derivatives in animal models of stroke. METHODS: We present a systematic review of reports describing the use of piracetam and its derivatives in animal models of focal ischaemia, where the outcome was measured as an infarct size or neurological score (Der Simonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis). RESULTS: Only 2 studies, published 10 years after the first clinical trial of piracetam had been initiated, described its efficacy in animal models of stroke. A further 4 studies described the efficacy of related compounds. Piracetam and its derivatives improved the outcome by 30.2% (95% CI = 16.1-44.4). The median study quality was 4/10 (inter-quartile range = 4-6). CONCLUSION: Piracetam and its derivatives demonstrate neuroprotective efficacy in experimental stroke, but our findings raise concerns about the amount of available data, the quality of the studies and publication bias.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At least part of the failure in the transition from experimental to clinical studies in stroke has been attributed to the imprecision introduced by problems in the design of experimental stroke studies. Using a metaepidemiologic approach, we addressed the effect of randomization, blinding, and use of comorbid animals on the estimate of how effectively therapeutic interventions reduce infarct size. METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were performed to identify meta-analyses that described interventions in experimental stroke. For each meta-analysis thus identified, a reanalysis was conducted to estimate the impact of various quality items on the estimate of efficacy, and these estimates were combined in a meta-meta-analysis to obtain a summary measure of the impact of the various design characteristics. RESULTS: Thirteen meta-analyses that described outcomes in 15,635 animals were included. Studies that included unblinded induction of ischemia reported effect sizes 13.1% (95% CI, 26.4% to 0.2%) greater than studies that included blinding, and studies that included healthy animals instead of animals with comorbidities overstated the effect size by 11.5% (95% CI, 21.2% to 1.8%). No significant effect was found for randomization, blinded outcome assessment, or high aggregate CAMARADES quality score. CONCLUSIONS: We provide empirical evidence of bias in the design of studies, with studies that included unblinded induction of ischemia or healthy animals overestimating the effectiveness of the intervention. This bias could account for the failure in the transition from bench to bedside of stroke therapies.

AB  - In the present article we show how studying synaptic mechanisms in hippocampal slice preparations provides information that may be useful in, firstly, the understanding of the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease and, secondly, in the development of novel therapies for dementia. We use several examples, drawn from our own work: (i) The identification of the function of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. (ii) The discovery of mechanisms that can regulate the activation of NMDA receptors. (iii) The use of transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. (iv) The identification of a mechanism that can account for the cognitive enhancing effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. (v) The discovery of a role of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (tau kinase) in synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease constitutes a rising threat to public health. Despite extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying the pathogenic agent present in the human brain and showing that it confers key features of Alzheimer's disease has not been achieved. We extracted soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The oligomers potently inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), enhanced long-term depression (LTD) and reduced dendritic spine density in normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease brain also disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats. These various effects were specifically attributable to Abeta dimers. Mechanistically, metabotropic glutamate receptors were required for the LTD enhancement, and N-methyl D-aspartate receptors were required for the spine loss. Co-administering antibodies to the Abeta N-terminus prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas antibodies to the midregion or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid plaque cores from Alzheimer's disease cortex did not impair LTP unless they were first solubilized to release Abeta dimers, suggesting that plaque cores are largely inactive but sequester Abeta dimers that are synaptotoxic. We conclude that soluble Abeta oligomers extracted from Alzheimer's disease brains potently impair synapse structure and function and that dimers are the smallest synaptotoxic species.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The neutral results of the SAINT II trial have again highlighted difficulties translating neuroprotective efficacy from bench to bedside. Animal studies are susceptible to study quality biases, which may lead to overstatement of efficacy. We report the impact of study quality on published estimates of the efficacy of NXY-059 in animal models of stroke. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and stratified meta-analysis of published studies describing the efficacy of NXY-059 in experimental focal cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: Overall, NXY-059 improved infarct volume by 43.3% (95% CI, 34.7 to 52.8). Only 2 of 9 publications reported randomization, concealment of treatment allocation, and blinded outcome assessment. Studies not reporting these quality items gave substantially higher estimates of efficacy than did higher-quality studies. CONCLUSIONS: The reported efficacy of NXY-059 in animal models of stroke is confounded by low study quality. The failure of SAINT II highlights the need for substantial improvements in the design, conduct, and reporting of animal studies; journals can play an important role in this by adopting standards for animal studies similar to those agreed over 10 years ago for clinical trials.

AB  - Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). There is controversy regarding the use of current diagnostic criteria for AD and whether amyloid plaques and NFTs contribute to cognitive impairment. Because AD is specific to humans, rigorous and comprehensiveclinicopathologic studies are necessary to test and refine hypotheses of AD diagnosis and pathogenesis. Neither the clinical nor the pathological aspects of AD evolve in a linear manner, but thepredictable sequence of AD pathology allows for stage-based correlations with cognitive deterioration. We discuss subsets of patients with clinical dementia who lack amyloid plaques and NFTs and, conversely, whether individuals without antemortem cognitive impairment can harbor severe AD-type pathological findings at autopsy. There are many medical, technical, and anatomical challenges to clinicopathologic studies in AD. For example, at least two thirds of persons older than 80 years have non-AD brain diseases that can effect on cognitive function. We argue that existing data strongly support the hypothesis that both amyloid plaques and NFTs contribute to cognitive impairment.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is an easily accessible and low-cost modality that might prove to be a particularly powerful tool for the identification of subtle functional changes preceding structural or metabolic deficits in progressive mild cognitive impairment (PMCI). Most previous contributions in this field assessed quantitative EEG differences between healthy controls, MCI and Alzheimer's disease(AD) cases leading to contradictory data. In terms of MCI conversion to AD, certain longitudinal studies proposed various quantitative EEG parameters for an a priori distinction between PMCI and stable MCI. However, cross-sectional comparisons revealed a substantial overlap in these parameters between MCI patients and elderly controls. Methodological differences including variable clinical definition of MCI cases and substantial interindividual differences within the MCI group could partly explain these discrepancies. Most importantly, EEG measurements without cognitive demand in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs have demonstrated limited sensitivity and generally do not produce significant group differences in spectral EEG parameters. Since the evolution of AD is characterized by the progressive loss of functional connectivity within neocortical association areas, event-modulated EEG dynamic analysis which makes it possible to investigate the functional activation of neocortical circuits may represent a more sensitive method to identify early alterations of neuronal networks predictive of AD development among MCI cases. The present review summarizes clinically significant results of EEG activation studies in this field and discusses future perspectives of research aiming to reach an early and individual prediction of cognitive decline in healthy elderly controls.

Most importantly, EEG measurements without cognitive demand in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs have demonstrated limited sensitivity and generally do not produce significant group differences in spectral EEG parameters. Since the evolution of AD is characterized by the progressive loss of functional connectivity within neocortical association areas, event-modulated EEG dynamic analysis which makes it possible to investigate the functional activation of neocortical circuits may represent a more sensitive method to identify early alterations of neuronal networks predictive of AD development among MCI cases. The present review summarizes clinically significant results of EEG activation studies in this field and discusses future perspectives of research aiming to reach an early and individual prediction of cognitive decline in healthy elderly controls.

AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are associated with neuronal loss and correlate with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease, but how NFTs relate to neuronal death is not clear. We studied cell death in Tg4510 mice that reversibly express P301L mutant human tau and accumulate NFTs using in vivo multiphoton imaging of neurofibrillary pathology, propidium iodide (PI) incorporation into cells, caspase activation, and DNA labeling. We first observed that in live mice, a minority of neurons were labeled with the caspase probe or with PI fluorescence. These markers of cell stress were localized in the same cells and appeared specifically within NFT-bearing neurons. Contrary to expectations, the PI-stained neurons did not die during a day of observation; the presence of Hoechst-positive nuclei in them on the subsequent day indicated that the NFT-associated membrane disruption, as suggested by PI staining, and caspase activation do not lead to immediate death of neurons in this tauopathy model. This unique combination of in vivo multiphoton imaging with markers of cell death and pathological alteration is a powerful tool for investigating neuronal damage associated with neurofibrillary pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (RA) is an anti-inflammatory protein used to treat arthritis that has also been identified as a candidate stroke drug. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports of the efficacy of IL-1 RA in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: We identified 16 published sources and one unpublished source of data. IL-1 RA reduced infarct volume by 38.2% (95% confidence interval 31.2%-45.1%). Efficacy was higher with higher doses, earlier treatment, and central administration of drug. No studies used animals with hypertension or diabetes or tested efficacy beyond 3 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The animal data supporting IL-1 RA as a candidate drug for stroke are limited, and further experiments are required before proceeding to clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Despite common emotional symptoms in AD such as anxiety and fear are associated with a more rapid cognitive decline, the pathological mechanisms involved in these behavioral changes remain largely elusive. In this study, we examined the pathological mechanisms of emotional behavior in well-established AD transgenic mice expressing human mutant beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP(Ind) and APP(Sw,Ind)) and tau (3xTg-AD). METHODS: We evaluated unconditioned and conditioned fear-induced freezing behavior and spatial memory in APP(Ind), APP(Sw,Ind), and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice. The Abeta and tau pathologies and signaling pathways involved in emotional processing were studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses. RESULTS: The APP(Ind)/APP(Sw,Ind) and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice displayed at early ages enhanced innate and conditioned fear symptoms and spatial memory deficits coinciding with enhanced accumulation of Abeta in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively, of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Similarly, the number of neurons with intraneuronal Abeta40 and Abeta42 was significantly increased in the BLA of human AD brains. Fear responses might reflect an influence of anxiety, because the anxiolytic compounds valproate, diazepam, and buspirone reduced efficiently unconditioned and conditioned fear responses in APP transgenic mice. In addition, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, which is critical for acquisition and consolidation of fear conditioning, was increased in the amygdala of APP transgenic mice after cued conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a deleterious role of intraneuronal Abeta on amygdala-dependent emotional responses by affecting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive, global and functional instruments have been extensively investigated for correlations with neuropathological changes such as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), plaques, and synapse loss in the brain. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to correlate the functional, global and cognitive decline assessed clinically with the neuropathological changes observed in a large prospectively characterized cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We examined 150 subjects (16 MCI and 134 AD) that were prospectively assessed and longitudinally followed to autopsy. MCI subjects clinically met Petersen criteria for single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. AD subjects clinically met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable or possible AD. All subjects received the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ante-mortem. Plaque and tangle counts were gathered for hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. Braak staging was performed as well. RESULTS: The GDS, FAST and MMSE correlated with plaque counts in all regions. The GDS, FAST and MMSE correlated with tangle counts in in all regions. The three instruments also correlated with the Braak score. The MMSE and GDS correlate better than the FAST in most regions. CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of neuropathology appears to correlate with functional, global, and cognitive decline as people progress from MCI through AD.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) has shown promise as a neuroprotectant in animal models of ischemic stroke. EPO is thought not only to protect neurons from cell death, but also to promote regeneration after stroke. Here, we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of EPO in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. Primary outcomes were infarct size and neurobehavioral outcome. Nineteen studies involving 346 animals for infarct size and 425 animals for neurobehavioral outcome met our inclusion criteria. Erythropoietin improved infarct size by 30.0% (95% CI: 21.3 to 38.8) and neurobehavioral outcome by 39.8% (33.7 to 45.9). Studies that randomized to treatment group or that blinded assessment of outcome showed lower efficacy. Erythropoietin was tested in animals with hypertension in no studies reporting infarct size and in 7.5% of the animals reporting neurobehavioral outcome. These findings show efficacy for EPO in experimental stroke, but when the impact of common sources of bias are considered, this efficacy falls, suggesting we may be overestimating its potential benefit. As common human co-morbidities may reduce therapeutic efficacy, broader testing to delineate the range of circumstances in which EPO works best would be beneficial.

AB  - NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION HAS BEEN RETIRED. THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by adult-onset progressive dementia associated with cerebral cortical atrophy, beta-amyloid plaque formation, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. AD typically begins with subtle memory failure that becomes more severe and is eventually incapacitating. Other common findings include confusion, poor judgment, language disturbance, agitation, withdrawal, hallucinations, seizures, Parkinsonian features, increased muscle tone, myoclonus, incontinence, and mutism. Familial AD (FAD) characterizes families that have more than one member with AD and usually implies multiple affected persons in more than one generation. Early-onset FAD (EOFAD) refers to families in which onset is consistently before age 60 to 65 years and often before age 55 years. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: EOFAD is diagnosed in families with multiple affected individuals with mean age of onset before 65 years and/or with a documented pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to be associated with EOFAD. The three clinically indistinguishable subtypes of EOFAD based on the underlying genetic mechanism are: Alzheimer disease type 1 (AD1), caused by mutation of APP (10%-15% of EOFAD); Alzheimer disease type 3 (AD3), caused by mutation of PSEN1, (30%-70% of EOFAD); and Alzheimer disease type 4 (AD4), caused by mutation of PSEN2 (<5% of EOFAD). Kindreds with autosomal dominant EOFAD with no identifiable pathogenic variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP have been described; thus, it is likely that variants in additional genes are causative. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Supportive; symptoms of depression, aggression, sleep disturbance, seizures, and hallucinations are managed on an individual basis; affected individuals eventually require assisted living/nursing home care; agents that increase cholinergic activity, such as Aricept(®) (donepezil), Exelon(®) (rivastigmine), and Reminy(®) (galatamine), show modest but variable benefit; memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is approved for use in AD; physical and occupational therapy help manage activities of daily living. Surveillance: Monthly monitoring to identify and manage secondary complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sudden changes in environment; over-sedation. GENETIC COUNSELING: EOFAD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with EOFAD had an affected parent; occasionally, neither parent is identified as having had the disease, but a second-degree relative (e.g., an uncle, aunt, and/or grandparent) has or had EOFAD. Each child of an individual with EOFAD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and developing EOFAD. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known; however, prenatal testing for adult-onset disorders is uncommon.

AB  - Studies of post-mortem tissue have shown that the location of fibrillar tau deposits, called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), matches closely with regions of massive neuronal death, severe cytological abnormalities, and markers of caspase activation and apoptosis, leading to the idea that tangles cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and tau-related frontotemporal dementia. However, using in vivo multiphoton imaging to observe tangles and activation of executioner caspases in living tau transgenic mice (Tg4510 strain), we find the opposite: caspase activation occurs first, and precedes tangle formation by hours to days. New tangles form within a day. After a new tangle forms, the neuron remains alive and caspase activity seems to be suppressed. Similarly, introduction of wild-type 4-repeat tau (tau-4R) into wild-type animals triggered caspase activation, tau truncation and tau aggregation. Adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of a construct mimicking caspase-cleaved tau into wild-type mice led to the appearance of intracellular aggregates, tangle-related conformational- and phospho-epitopes, and the recruitment of full-length endogenous tau to the aggregates. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model in which caspase activation cleaves tau to initiate tangle formation, then truncated tau recruits normal tau to misfold and form tangles. Because tangle-bearing neurons are long-lived, we suggest that tangles are 'off pathway' to acute neuronal death. Soluble tau species, rather than fibrillar tau, may be the critical toxic moiety underlying neurodegeneration.

AB  - No single animal model is able to encompass all of the variables known to affect human ischemic stroke. This review highlights the major strengths and weaknesses of the most commonly used animal models of acute ischemic stroke in the context of matching model and experimental aim. Particular emphasis is placed on the relationships between outcome and underlying vascular variability, physiologic control, and use of models of comorbidity. The aim is to provide, for novice and expert alike, an overview of the key controllable determinants of experimental stroke outcome to help ensure the most effective application of animal models to translational research.

AB  - Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) improves outcome in animal models of stroke and in clinical trial, but is associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage. Here, we explore the impact of biologic and experimental design factors on efficacy and bleeding. We conducted a systematic review of studies describing the effect of tPA in thrombotic occlusion models of ischemic stroke followed by random effects meta-analysis, meta-regression, and trim and fill. We identified 202, 66, 128, and 54 comparisons reporting infarct volume, neurobehavioral score, hemorrhage, and mortality, respectively. The rtPA reduced infarct volume by 25.2% (95% confidence interval=21.8 to 28.6, 3388 animals), improved neurobehavioral score by 18.0% (12.6% to 23.3%, n=1243), increased the risk of hemorrhage (odds ratio=1.71, 1.42 to 2.07, n=2833) and had no significant effect on mortality (odds ratio=0.82, 0.62 to 1.08, n=1274). There was an absolute reduction in efficacy of 1.1% (0.7% to 1.4%) for every 10 minutes delay to treatment. Cumulative meta-analysis showed that the estimate of efficacy fell as more data became available. Publication bias inflated efficacy by 5.1% (infarct volume) and 8.1% (neurobehavioral score). This data set was large enough to be adequately powered to estimate with precision the impact of biologic and experimental factors on the efficacy and safety of rtPA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In other neurological diseases, the failure to translate pre-clinical findings to effective clinical treatments has been partially attributed to bias introduced by shortcomings in the design of animal experiments. OBJECTIVES: Here we evaluate published studies of interventions in animal models of multiple sclerosis for methodological design and quality and to identify candidate interventions with the best evidence of efficacy. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature describing experiments testing the effectiveness of interventions in animal models of multiple sclerosis was carried out. Data were extracted for reported study quality and design and for neurobehavioural outcome. Weighted mean difference meta-analysis was used to provide summary estimates of the efficacy for drugs where this was reported in five or more publications. RESULTS: The use of a drug in a pre-clinical multiple sclerosis model was reported in 1152 publications, of which 1117 were experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). For 36 interventions analysed in greater detail, neurobehavioural score was improved by 39.6% (95% CI 34.9-44.2%, p < 0.001). However, few studies reported measures to reduce bias, and those reporting randomization or blinding found significantly smaller effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: EAE has proven to be a valuable model in elucidating pathogenesis as well as identifying candidate therapies for multiple sclerosis. However, there is an inconsistent application of measures to limit bias that could be addressed by adopting methodological best practice in study design. Our analysis provides an estimate of sample size required for different levels of power in future studies and suggests a number of interventions for which there are substantial animal data supporting efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews are often advocated as the best source of evidence to guide both clinical decisions and healthcare policy, yet we know very little about the extent to which they require updating. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the average time to changes in evidence sufficiently important to warrant updating systematic reviews (referred to as the survival time) and to identify any characteristics that increase or decrease these survival times. To determine the performance characteristics of various surveillance protocols to identify important new evidence. To assess the utility of rates and patterns of growth for evidence within clinical areas as predictors of updating needs. To establish typical timeframes for the production and publication of systematic reviews in order to assess the extent to which they impact survival time (e.g., whether or not delays in the peer review and publication processes substantially shorten the time in the public domain before new evidence requires updating of a given systematic review). To characterize current updating practices and policies of agencies that sponsor systematic reviews. DESIGN: Survival analysis for a cohort of 100 quantitative systematic reviews that were indexed in ACP Journal Club with an accompanying commentary; supplementary sample of Cochrane reviews meeting the same criteria and AHRQ evidence reports; internet-based survey of agencies that sponsor or undertake systematic reviews. SAMPLE: Eligible reviews evaluated the clinical benefit or harm of a specific (class of) drug, device, or procedure, were originally published between 1995 and 2005, and included at least one quantitative synthesis result in the form of an odds ratio, relative risk, risk difference, or mean difference. For the survey of updating policies and practices, we contacted 22 organizations that are well-known to produce or fund systematic reviews (including 12 AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Centers). DATA SOURCES: Systematic reviews indexed in ACP J Club and eligible new trials identified through five search protocols. MEASUREMENTS: Quantitative signals for updating consisted of changes in statistical significance or a relative change in effect magnitude of at least 50 percent involving one of the primary outcomes of the original systematic review or any mortality outcome. These signals were assessed by comparing the original meta-analytic results with updated results that included eligible new trials. Qualitative signals included substantial differences in characterizations of effectiveness, new information about harm, emergence of superior alternative treatments, and important caveats about the previously reported findings that would affect clinical decisionmaking. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of either a qualitative or quantitative signal for updating the original systematic review. We also assessed the occurrence of a signal for updating within 2 years of publication, as some sources (e.g., The Cochrane Library) currently recommend updating systematic reviews every two years. The survey measured existing updating policies, current strategies in use, and additional perceptions related to the updating process from the 18 organizations that responded. RESULTS: The cohort of 100 systematic reviews included a median of 13 studies (inter-quartile range: 8 to 21) and 2663 participants (inter-quartile range: 1281 to 8371) per review. A qualitative or quantitative signal for updating occurred for 57 systematic reviews. Median survival free of a signal for updating was 5.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6–7.6), but in 23 cases (95% CI: 15% to 33%), a signal for updating occurred in less than 2 years, and in 15 cases (95% CI: 9% to 24%) the signal occurred in less than 1 year. In 7 cases (95% CI: 3% to 14%), a signal had already occurred at the time of publication of the original review. Shorter survival was associated with cardiovascular medicine (hazard ratio of 3.26, 95% CI: 1.71 to 6.21; p =0.0003), heterogeneity in the original review (hazard ratio of 2.23, 95% CI: 1.22 to 4.09; p =0.01), and having a new trial larger than the previous largest trial (hazard ratio of 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.15; p =0.01). Systematic reviews with more than the median of 13 included studies had increased survival (hazard ratio of 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.98; p =0.04). No feature of the original review significantly predicted a signal for updating occurring within 2 years of publication. Median time from the final search date to indexing 1.4 years (inter-quartile range; 0.96–2.0 years). Lags from search to publication were shortest for Cochrane reviews (median 0.6 years, inter-quartile range: 0.42–1.25) and longest for journal reviews (median 1.3 years; inter-quartile range: 0.84–1.77), with technical reports falling in between (median 1.1 years; inter-quartile range: 0.87–1.42) (Kruskal Wallis χ2 11.24, p =0.004). Of the five search protocols tested for their effectiveness in identifying eligible new trials, the combination with the highest recall and lowest screening burden were the strategy that used the PubMed Related Articles feature (applied to the three newest and three largest trials included in the original review) and the strategy involved submitting a subject search (based on population and intervention) to the Clinical Query filter for therapy. This combination identified most new signaling evidence with median screening burden of 71 new records per review. For the survey of organizations involved in producing or funding systematic reviews, we received responses from 19 (86%) of the 22 organizations contacted. Approximately two thirds (68%) of respondents identified themselves as producers of systematic reviews and an additional 21% identified themselves as both funders and producers of systematic reviews. Only two respondents (11%) characterized themselves solely as funders of systematic reviews. Approximately 80% of respondents characterized the importance of updating as ‘high’ or ‘very high’, although 68% acknowledged not having any formal policies for updating in place. Approximately two thirds (13/19; 68%) of respondents reported that over 20% of the reviews they commission or produce are out of date, and 32% respondents (6/19) reported that at least 50% of their reviews were out of date. Barriers to updating identified by respondents included lack of appropriate methodologies, resource constraints, lack of academic credit, and limited publishing formats. The majority of the sample (16/19; 84%) indicated they ‘somewhat’ to ‘strongly’ favor the development of a central registry, analogous to efforts within the clinical trials community, to coordinate updating activities across agencies and review groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of high quality systematic reviews directly relevant to clinical practice, signals for updating occurred frequently and within relatively short timelines. A number of features significantly affected survival, but none significantly predicted the need for updating within 2 years. Currently, definitive methods about the frequency of updating cannot be made. Blanket recommendation such as every two years will miss a substantial number of important signals for updating that occur within shorter time lines, but more frequent updates will expend substantial resources. Methods for identifying reviews in need of updating based on surveillance for new evidence hold more promise than relying on features of the original review to identify reviews likely to need updating within a short time, but such approaches will require further investigation. Several of the methods tested were feasible, yielding good recall of relevant new evidence with modest screening burdens. The majority of organizations engaged in the funding or production of systematic reviews view the importance of updating systematic reviews as high to very high. Despite this recognition, most organizations report having no formal policy in place for updating previous systematic reviews. Slightly less than half of organizations performed periodic literature searches to identify new evidence, but searching frequencies varied widely, from monthly to every two years. If systematic reviews are to achieve their stated goal of providing the best evidence to inform clinical decision making and healthcare policy, issues related to identifying reviews in need of updating will require much greater attention. In the meantime, publishers of systematic reviews should consider a policy of requiring authors to update searches performed over 12 months prior to submission. And, users of systematic reviews need to recognize that important new evidence can appear within short timelines. When considering the results of a particular systematic review, users should search for more recent reviews or trials to see if any exist and determine if the results are consistent with the previous review.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: An enriched environment (EE) refers to conditions that facilitate or enhance sensory, cognitive, motor, and social stimulation relative to standard (laboratory) conditions. Despite numerous published studies investigating this concept in animal stroke models, there is still debate around its efficacy. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of an EE on neurobehavioral scores, learning, infarct size, and mortality in animal models of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Systematic review of controlled studies of the use of an EE in experimental stroke was conducted. Data extracted were analyzed using weighted mean difference meta-analysis. For pooled tests of neurobehavioral scores, a random effects standardized method was used. RESULTS: Animals recovering in an EE poststroke had mean neurobehavioral scores 0.9 standard deviations (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-1.3; P < .001) above the mean scores of animals recovering in standard conditions and showed a trend toward improvement in learning (25.1% improvement; 95% CI = 3.7-46.6; P = .02). There was no significant increase in death. Animals exposed to an EE had 8.0% larger infarcts than control animals (95% CI = 1.8-14.1; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate significant improvements in sensorimotor function with EE poststroke but suggest a small increase in infarct volume. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms requires further study but should not overshadow the observed functional improvements and their application to clinical trials during stroke rehabilitation.

AB  - Three decades of genetic research in Alzheimer disease (AD) have substantially broadened our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration and dementia. Positional cloning led to the identification of rare, disease-causing mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 causing early-onset familial AD, followed by the discovery of APOE as the single most important risk factor for late-onset AD. Recent genome-wide association approaches have delivered several additional AD susceptibility loci that are common in the general population, but exert only very small risk effects. As a result, a large proportion of the heritability of AD continues to remain unexplained by the currently known disease genes. It seems likely that much of this "missing heritability" may be accounted for by rare sequence variants, which, owing to recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, can now be assessed in unprecedented detail.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the patients can exhibit some behavioural disturbances in addition to cognitive impairment. The aims of the present study were to investigate the relationship between severity and rate of decline of the cognitive and behavioural impairment in patient with AD. METHODS: 54 AD patients were assessed at baseline and after 12 months with the Mental Deterioration Battery (MDB), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10). RESULTS: MDB was more accurate than ADAS-Cog in the early diagnosis of AD. Conversely, ADAS-Cog was more sensitive at revealing the progression of cognitive decline. Depression, Apathy and Anxiety are the most frequent and severe behavioural disturbances at baseline. At follow-up Delusions and Irritability increased significantly. Significant correlations were observed between severity of cognitive impairment and behavioural disorders both at baseline and in the progression rate passing from T0 to T12. CONCLUSIONS: Severity and progression rate of behavioural and cognitive alterations in patients with AD are significantly associated.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is the process by which the brain alters the strength of its synaptic connections, a fundamental function of the brain that enables individuals to learn from experience. The study of synaptic plasticity often involves the application of standard in vitro electrophysiological techniques to hippocampal slice preparations. This unit discusses many of the special considerations that are applicable for the optimal study of synaptic plasticity in this system. Most of these principles also apply to the study of synaptic plasticity in other brain slice preparations.

AB  - Acetylcholine is a potent excitatory neurotransmitter, crucial for cognition and the control of alertness and arousal. Vigilance-specific recordings of the electroencephalogram (EEG) potently reflect thalamo-cortical and brainstem-cortical cholinergic activity that drives theta rhythms and task-specific cortical (de-synchronisation. Additionally, cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain act as a relay centre for the brainstem-cortical arousal system, but also directly modulate cortical activity, and thus promote wakefulness or rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Disease states such as sleep disorders, dementia and certain types of epilepsy are a further reflection of the potent cholinergic impact on CNS physiology and function, and highlight the relevance and inter-dependence of sleep and EEG. With novel technologies and computational tools now becoming available, advanced mechanistic insights may be gained and new avenues explored for diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB  - With increasing feasibility of predicting conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia based on biomarker profiling, the urgent need for efficacious disease-modifying compounds has become even more critical. Despite intensive research, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain insufficiently documented for purposeful target discovery. Translational research based on valid animal models may aid in alleviating some of the unmet needs in the current Alzheimer's disease pharmaceutical market, which includes disease-modification, increased efficacy and safety, reduction of the number of treatment unresponsive patients and patient compliance. The development and phenotyping of animal models is indeed essential in Alzheimer's disease-related research as valid models enable the appraisal of early pathological processes - which are often not accessible in patients, and subsequent target discovery and evaluation. This review paper summarizes and critically evaluates currently available animal models, and discusses their value to the Alzheimer drug discovery pipeline. Models dealt with include spontaneous models in various species, including senescence-accelerated mice, chemical and lesion-induced rodent models, and genetically modified models developed in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio and rodents. Although highly valid animal models exist, none of the currently available models recapitulates all aspects of human Alzheimer's disease, and one should always be aware of the potential dangers of uncritical extrapolating from model organisms to a human condition that takes decades to develop and mainly involves higher cognitive functions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) can be a severely disabling condition in spite of therapies currently available. Systematic review and meta-analysis can provide an overview of a field of research and identify potential sources of bias and limits to efficacy. In this study we use these tools to describe the reported efficacy of dopamine agonists in animal models of PD. METHODS: Publications were identified by electronic searching of three online databases. Data were extracted for neurobehavioural outcome, for study design and for the reporting of measures to avoid bias. Standardised mean difference meta-analysis was used to provide summary estimates of efficacy, with the effects of study quality and study design explored using stratified meta-analysis. RESULTS: 253 publications reported the use of a dopamine agonist in an animal model of PD; of these 121 reported data suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis. 47 interventions were tested in 601 experiments using 4181 animals. Overall, neurobehavioural outcome was improved by 1.08 standard deviations (SD; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.97-1.19). Reporting of measures to reduce bias was low and publications which reported the blinded assessment of outcome had significantly smaller effect sizes (0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07) than those which did not (1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: While dopamine agonists do appear to have efficacy in animal models of PD the low prevalence of reporting of measures to avoid bias is of concern. Systematic review of individual interventions may be helpful in the design of future preclinical and clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interventions that improve functional outcome after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in animals might benefit humans. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature to find studies of nonsurgical treatments tested in animal models of ICH. METHODS: In July 2009 we searched Ovid Medline (from 1950), Embase (from 1980), and ISI Web of Knowledge (from 1969) for controlled animal studies of nonsurgical interventions given after the induction of ICH that reported neurobehavioral outcome. We assessed study quality and performed meta-analysis using a weighted mean difference random effects model. RESULTS: Of 13,343 publications, 88 controlled studies described the effects of 64 different medical interventions (given a median of 2 hours after ICH induction) on 38 different neurobehavioral scales in 2,616 treated or control animals (median 14 rodents per study). Twenty-seven (31%) studies randomized treatment allocation, and 7 (8%) reported allocation concealment; these studies had significantly smaller effect sizes than those without these attributes (p < 0.001). Of 64 interventions stem cells, calcium channel blockers, anti-inflammatory drugs, iron chelators, and estrogens improved both structural outcomes and neurobehavioral scores in >1 study. Meta-regression revealed that together, structural outcome and the intervention used accounted for 65% of the observed heterogeneity in neurobehavioral score (p < 0.001, adjusted r(2) = 0.65). INTERPRETATION: Further animal studies of the interventions that we found to improve both functional and structural outcomes in animals, using better experimental designs, could target efforts to translate effective treatments for ICH in animals into randomized controlled trials in humans.

AB  - Levels of tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. It is believed this elevation is related to the tau pathology and neurodegeneration observed in AD, but not all tauopathies have increased CSF tau. There has been little pre-clinical work to investigate mechanisms of increased CSF tau due to the difficulty in collecting CSF samples from mice, the most commonly used pre-clinical models. We developed methods to collect CSF from mice without contamination from tau in brain tissue, which is approximately 50,000 fold more abundant in brain than CSF. Using these methods, we measured CSF tau from 3xTg, Tg4510, and Tau Alone transgenic mice. All three lines of mice showed age-dependent increases in CSF tau. They varied in phenotype from undetectable to severe tau pathology and neurodegeneration, suggesting that degenerating neurons are unlikely to be the only source of pathologic CSF tau. Overall, CSF tau levels mirrored expression levels and changes of tau in the brain, but they did not always correlate exactly. CSF tau was often more sensitive to changes in brain transgene expression and pathology. In addition, we also developed ELISA assays specific to different regions of the tau protein. We used these assays to provide evidence that CSF tau exists as fragments, with little intact C-terminus and partial loss of the N-terminus. Taken together, these assays and mouse models may be used to facilitate a deeper understanding of CSF tau in neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and relates closely to the cognitive impairment characterizing this neurodegenerative process. A causative association has been proposed, largely on the basis of in vitro studies, between memory decline, soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers and alterations of glutamatergic neurotransmission. We aimed here to characterize in vivo N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated signaling, at an early stage of AD, before extracellular amyloid plaques are deposited. We assessed the functional link between cognitive abilities and NMDAR-mediated pharmacological responses of six-month-old AβPP23 transgenic mice (AβPP23tg), overexpressing the human amyloid-β protein precursor carrying the Swedish double mutation. We found evidence of cognitive impairments in these mice, indicated by deficits in the delayed-non-matching-to-place task. Alterations of NMDAR-mediated signaling in this mouse model were confirmed by the reduced sensitivity of motor-activation and working memory to pharmacological inhibition of NMDAR activity. At the molecular level, AβPP23tg mice show hippocampal alterations in the trafficking of synaptic NMDAR subunits NR2A and NR2B and at an ultrastructural analysis show Aβ oligomers intracellularly localized in the synaptic compartments. Importantly, the behavioral and biochemical alterations of NMDAR signaling are associated with the inhibition of long-term synaptic potentiation and inversion of metaplasticity at CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from AβPP23tg mice. These results indicate a general impairment of synaptic function and learning and memory in young AβPP23tg mice with Aβ oligomers but no amyloid plaques.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase, during which time its characteristic pathology accumulates and patient function declines, but symptoms are insufficient to warrant a clinical diagnosis of dementia. There have been increasing reports of noncognitive symptoms, including loss of motor function, reported to be associated with incident AD. To understand the link between motor function and preclinical AD, this article examines: our understanding of motor function and its clinical assessment in cohort studies; the relationship of motor function and loss of cognition in older persons; risk factors for cognitive and motor decline; and the relation of post-mortem indices of AD and motor function prior to death. Together, these data suggest that age-related cognitive and motor decline may share a common causation. Furthermore, individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD may represent the 'tip of the iceberg', since AD pathology may also account for a substantial proportion of cognitive and motor dysfunction currently considered 'normal aging' in older persons without dementia. Thus, AD may have a much larger impact on the health and wellbeing of our aging population.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia severity correlates strongly with decreased synapse density in hippocampus and cortex. Numerous studies report that hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) can be inhibited by soluble oligomers of amyloid β-protein (Aβ), but the synaptic elements that mediate this effect remain unclear. We examined field EPSPs and whole-cell recordings in wild-type mouse hippocampal slices. Soluble Aβ oligomers from three distinct sources (cultured cells, AD cortex, or synthetic peptide) inhibited LTP, and this was prevented by the selective NR2B inhibitors ifenprodil and Ro 25-6981. Soluble Aβ enhanced NR2B-mediated NMDA currents and extrasynaptic responses; these effects were mimicked by the glutamate reuptake inhibitor dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid. Downstream, an Aβ-mediated rise in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was followed by downregulation of cAMP response element-binding protein, and LTP impairment was prevented by inhibitors of p38 MAPK or calpain. Thus, soluble Aβ oligomers at low nanomolar levels present in AD brain increase activation of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors, thereby impairing synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Transgenic (Tg) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are used to investigate mechanisms underlying disease pathology and identify therapeutic strategies. Most Tg AD models, which at least partly recapitulate the AD phenotype, are based on insertion of one or more human mutations (identified in Familial AD) into the mouse genome, with the notable exception of the anti-NGF mouse, which is based on the cholinergic unbalance hypothesis. It has recently emerged that impaired hippocampal synaptic function is an early detectable pathological alteration, well before the advanced stage of amyloid plaque accumulation and general cell death. Nevertheless, electrophysiological studies performed on different Tg models or on the same model by different research groups have yielded contrasting results. We therefore summarized data from original research papers studying hippocampal synaptic function using electrophysiology, to review what we have learned so far. We analyzed results obtained using the following Tg models: (1) single/multiple APP mutations; (2) single presenilin (PS) mutations; (3) APPxPS1 mutations; (4) APPxPS1xtau mutations (3xTg); and (5) anti-NGF expressing (AD11) mice. We observed that the majority of papers focus on excitatory basic transmission and long-term potentiation, while few studies evaluate inhibitory transmission and long-term depression. We searched for common synaptic alterations in the various models that might underlie the memory deficits observed in these mice. We also considered experimental variables that could explain differences in the reported results and briefly discuss successful rescue strategies. These analyses should prove useful for future design of electrophysiology experiments to assess hippocampal function in AD mouse models.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by insidious cognitive decline and memory dysfunction. Synapse loss is the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline in AD and mounting evidence suggests that AD is primarily a disease of synaptic dysfunction. Soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (Abeta), the peptide that aggregates to form senile plaques in the brain of AD patients, have been shown to be toxic to neuronal synapses both in vitro and in vivo. Abeta oligomers inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) and facilitate long-term depression (LTD), electrophysiological correlates of memory formation. Furthermore, oligomeric Abeta has also been shown to induce synapse loss and cognitive impairment in animals. The molecular underpinnings of these observations are now being elucidated, and may provide clear therapeutic targets for effectively treating the disease. Here, we review recent findings concerning AD pathogenesis with a particular focus on how Abeta impacts synapses.

AB  - To date, only a few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acids (FA) on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some of these studies demonstrated that patients with very mild AD or mild cognitive impairment benefit from omega-3 FA treatment, but none showed significant improvements in cognitive function in patients with moderate or advanced AD. All these RCTs had a relatively short duration of supplementation, however, and we hypothesized that this might be one of the reasons why no effects of omega-3 FA supplementation could be observed in patients with "moderate" or "advanced" AD. Animal studies offer better possibilities for controlled long-term supplementation than clinical studies. Therefore, we performed a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis of the literature that focused on effects of the relatively long-term omega-3 FA supplementation (minimum period; 10% of average total lifespan) on cognitive impairment, amyloid-beta pathology, and neuronal loss in animal models of AD. This SR shows that long-term omega-3 FA supplementation decreased the omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio and reduced the amount of amyloid-beta in experimental animal models of AD. Omega-3 FA supplementation also improved cognitive function; this effect appeared larger in rats compared to mice, and in males compared to females. Moreover, omega-3 FA supplementation diminished the amount of neuronal loss, especially in female animals. The results of this SR indicate that it might be worthwhile to perform new clinical trials with long-term omega-3 FA supplementation in AD patients.

AB  - The brains of Alzheimer's disease patients show an increased number of senile plaques compared with normal patients. The major component of the plaques is the β-amyloid peptide, a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although the processing of APP has been well-described, the physiological functions of APP and its cleavage products remain unclear. This article reviews the multifunctional roles of an APP orthologue, the C. elegans APL-1. Understanding the function of APL-1 may provide insights into the functions and signaling pathways of human APP. In addition, the physiological effects of introducing human β-amyloid peptide into C. elegans are also reviewed. The C. elegans system provides a powerful genetic model to identify genes regulating the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular β-amyloid peptide accumulation.

AB  - The emergence of longevity in the modern world has brought a sense of urgency to understanding age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus regarding the correlation between the pathological substrates of neurodegeneration and dementia status, particularly in the oldest-old. To better understand the pathological correlates of dementia in the oldest-old, we characterized the topographical spread and severity of amyloid-beta, tau, TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein pathologies in the 90+ Study, a prospective longitudinal population-based study of ageing and dementia. Neuropathological analysis with immunohistochemically labelled sections was carried out blind to clinical diagnosis on the first 108 participants of the 90+ Study who came to autopsy including participants with dementia (n = 66) and without dementia (n = 42). We used quantitative and/or semi-quantitative measures to assess the burden of amyloid-beta, tau, TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein pathologies as well as hippocampal sclerosis. Amyloid-beta and tau were the predominant pathologies in the 90+ Study cohort and both amyloid-beta area and tau area occupied measures were strongly associated with the presence of dementia, as was Braak staging but semi-quantitative plaque scores were not. Notably, TDP-43 pathology also correlated with dementia, while alpha-synuclein distribution did not. In addition, hippocampal sclerosis was specific to participants with dementia and correlated with the presence of limbic TDP-43. In contrast to previous reports, we found that tau and amyloid-beta continue to be robust pathological correlates of dementia, even in the oldest-old. While individuals with no dementia had limited hippocampal tau and neocortical amyloid-beta pathology, dementia associated with an expansion in pathology, including increased neocortical tau and hippocampal amyloid-beta plaques, more abundant neocortical amyloid-beta deposition and hippocampal sclerosis with its attendant TDP-43 pathology.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fast growing world-wide epidemic. AD is a genetically complex, slowly progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease of the brain. During decades of asymptomatic progression multiple interactive systems, pathways and molecular mechanisms (e.g. protein processing, aberrant signaling, inflammation and immune system, lipid transport, endocytosis, apoptosis, oxidative damage and response to stress, tau pathology, neuron and synapse loss, energy metabolism), contribute to the development of the early clinical prodromal stage with episodic memory deficits and to further decline and loss of general cognitive functioning during the final syndromal dementia stage. The non-mendelian genetically complex "sporadic" AD type is the most common form of dementia affecting people usually over the age of 65. Despite considerable progress of AD research in recent years and evolving paradigm shifts in both pathophysiological concepts as well as in diagnostic criteria fundamental challenges have not yet been resolved. The strong age-related incidence, the recent failure and complete lack of disease-modifying or preventive therapy that may delay onset or substantially affect the pathophysiology of AD, result in an enormous burden posed both on individuals, their families and care givers, and the societies at large, and these call for urgent concerted worldwide measures. Based on the meeting of the German Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease (GTF-AD) in Paris on July 19th 2011, the present position paper provides an overview on the current state and future developments in epidemiology, pathophysiology, disease conceptualization, diagnostic criteria and their use in research and clinical practice, as well as preventive and symptomatic therapeutic approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on a discussion of the different approaches to diagnostics and therapy taken by preventive/public health medicine, methodologically advanced academic research propagating the use of sophisticated biomarkers, and everyday clinical practice focusing on patient-centered care. During the next 10 years, major advances both in early detection as well as in therapy and comprehensive AD care seem mandatory. These still unmet needs call for ever more concerted and focused efforts in research across the world to combat the erupting and as yet uncontrolled epidemic of AD.

A wide variety of model organisms have been utilized, including bacteria (Escherichia coli), plants (Arabidopsis thaliana), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), arthropods (Drosophila melanogaster), fish (zebrafish, Danio rerio), rodents (mouse, Mus musculus and rat, Rattus norvegicus) as well as non-human primates (rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta). These transgenic systems have enormous value for understanding the pathophysiological basis of these disorders and have, in some cases, been instrumental in the development of therapeutic approaches to treat these conditions. In this review, we discuss the most commonly used model organisms and the methodologies available for the preparation of transgenic organisms. Moreover, we provide selected examples of the use of these technologies for the preparation of transgenic animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) and discuss the application of these technologies to AD as an example of how transgenic modeling has affected the study of human neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) include "positive" lesions such as amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, neurofibrillary tangles, and glial responses, and "negative" lesions such as neuronal and synaptic loss. Despite their inherently cross-sectional nature, postmortem studies have enabled the staging of the progression of both amyloid and tangle pathologies, and, consequently, the development of diagnostic criteria that are now used worldwide. In addition, clinicopathological correlation studies have been crucial to generate hypotheses about the pathophysiology of the disease, by establishing that there is a continuum between "normal" aging and AD dementia, and that the amyloid plaque build-up occurs primarily before the onset of cognitive deficits, while neurofibrillary tangles, neuron loss, and particularly synaptic loss, parallel the progression of cognitive decline. Importantly, these cross-sectional neuropathological data have been largely validated by longitudinal in vivo studies using modern imaging biomarkers such as amyloid PET and volumetric MRI.

AB  - The discovery of gene mutations responsible for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has enabled researchers to reproduce in transgenic mice several hallmarks of this disorder, notably Abeta accumulation, though in most cases without neurofibrillary tangles. Mice expressing mutated and wild-type APP as well as C-terminal fragments of APP exhibit variations in exploratory activity reminiscent of behavioural and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer dementia (BPSD). In particular, open-field, spontaneous alternation, and elevated plus-maze tasks as well as aggression are modified in several APP transgenic mice relative to non-transgenic controls. However, depending on the precise murine models, changes in open-field and elevated plus-maze exploration occur in either direction, either increased or decreased relative to controls. It remains to be determined which neurotransmitter changes are responsible for this variability, in particular with respect to GABA, 5HT, and dopamine.

AB  - Visuospatial dysfunction including defects in motion perception in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are clues to search for potential in vivo biomarkers. In this review, we focus on the clinical relevance of non-invasive neurophysiological findings in event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess visual dysfunction in AD and MCI. We first summarize the current concept of the parallel visual pathways in primates and humans. Next, we outline the results of previous electrophysiological and fMRI studies on visual function in AD and MCI. Finally, we present the recent findings of our systematic ERP and fMRI approach to visual perception in AD and MCI. Our overview strongly indicates that visual impairments in patients with AD and MCI are mainly caused by dysfunction in higher-level parallel visual pathways. In particular, a deficit in ventro-dorsal stream function related to optic flow perception is responsible for the earliest and most prominent visual symptoms in MCI. Therefore, we conclude that ERP and fMRI measurements for visual perception can be used as in vivo biomarkers for early functional brain changes in MCI and AD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since Cognex, more than 200 Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug candidates have failed. Investigations have identified vulnerabilities of these AD drug developments to methodological errors. (-)-Phenserine has been discussed as possibly failing due to flawed methods and practices in development. METHODS: We analyzed documentation of (-)-phenserine's development for vulnerabilities to errors and designed interventions for a redevelopment that could provide fair or unbiased assessments of (-)-phenserine target engagement, target relevance for human diseases, and adequate presumptive evidence of efficacy as a therapeutic for one or more diagnoses to justify registration-required clinical trials. RESULTS: Similar to studies of 40 other AD developments, with (-)-phenserine, we found little evidence of preemptive interventions against potentially invalidating errors, grounds to judge progress in development through stages as not scientifically justifiable, and variance excess and placebo group improvements as capable of accounting for outcomes from various studies in the development. We propose to compare a redevelopment resourced to counter these deficiencies with the original development as historical control to evaluate further our hypothesis that errors in development accounted for the (-)-phenserine failure, specifically, and other AD drug failures, potentially. CONCLUSIONS: We find support for our earlier proposal that (-)-phenserine did not fail, but the methods of development did fail, to provide conditions where efficacy could be tested. We propose that redevelopment under conditions aimed to correct methodological deficiencies common in AD drug developments will successfully test efficacy for (-)-phenserine and hopefully lead to a disease-modifying addition to the AD therapeutic armamentarium.

AB  - Aging is associated with a gradual decline in cognitive functions, and more dramatic cognitive impairments occur in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Electrophysiological and molecular studies performed in aged animals and in animal models of AD have shown that cognitive decline is associated with significant modifications in synaptic plasticity (i.e., activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength) and have elucidated some of the cellular mechanisms underlying this process. Morphological studies have revealed a correlation between the quality of memory performance and the extent of structural changes of synaptic contacts occurring during memory consolidation. We briefly review recent experimental evidence here.

AB  - In animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta fragments interfere with mechanisms of cortical plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In the current study, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) in AD patients and in age-matched healthy controls, using protocols of theta burst stimulation (TBS) that are known to induce plastic changes resembling the LTP and LTD mechanisms described in animal models. AD patients showed consistent LTD-like effects that were comparable to those obtained in healthy controls when submitted to 40 seconds of continuous TBS. Conversely, AD patients did not show any LTP-like after effect when submitted to two different TBS protocols that induced an LTP-like effect in healthy controls such as intermittent TBS and 20 seconds of continuous TBS followed by one minute of muscular contraction. These results demonstrate the impairment of LTP-like together with normal LTD-like cortical plasticity in AD patients.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced changes in synaptic function in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that Abeta generation and accumulation may affect fundamental mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of APP overexpression on a well characterized, in vivo, developmental model of systems-level plasticity, ocular dominance plasticity. Following monocular visual deprivation during the critical period, mice that express mutant alleles of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and Presenilin1 (PS1dE9), as well as mice that express APPswe alone, lack ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex. Defects in the spatial extent and magnitude of the plastic response are evident using two complementary approaches, Arc induction and optical imaging of intrinsic signals in awake mice. This defect in a classic paradigm of systems level synaptic plasticity shows that Abeta overexpression, even early in postnatal life, can perturb plasticity in cerebral cortex, and supports the idea that decreased synaptic plasticity due to elevated Abeta exposure contributes to cognitive impairment in AD.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced changes in synaptic function in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that Abeta generation and accumulation may affect fundamental mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of APP overexpression on a well characterized, in vivo, developmental model of systems-level plasticity, ocular dominance plasticity. Following monocular visual deprivation during the critical period, mice that express mutant alleles of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and Presenilin1 (PS1dE9), as well as mice that express APPswe alone, lack ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex. Defects in the spatial extent and magnitude of the plastic response are evident using two complementary approaches, Arc induction and optical imaging of intrinsic signals in awake mice. This defect in a classic paradigm of systems level synaptic plasticity shows that Abeta overexpression, even early in postnatal life, can perturb plasticity in cerebral cortex, and supports the idea that decreased synaptic plasticity due to elevated Abeta exposure contributes to cognitive impairment in AD.

AB  - Stem cell therapy holds great promise in medicine, but clinical development should be based on a sound understanding of potential weaknesses in supporting experimental data. The aim of this article was to provide a systematic overview of evidence relating to the efficacy of stem cell-based therapies in animal models of stroke to foster the clinical application of stem cell-based therapies and to inform the design of large-scale clinical trials. We conducted a systematic search for reports of experiments using stem cells in animal models of cerebral ischaemia, and performed DerSimmonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis. We assessed the impact of study characteristics, of publication bias and of measures to reduce bias. We identified 6059 publications, 117 met our prespecified inclusion criteria. One hundred eighty-seven experiments using 2332 animals described changes in structural outcome and 192 experiments using 2704 animals described changes in functional outcome. Median study quality score was 4 (interquartile range 3 to 6) and less than half of studies reported randomization or blinded outcome assessment; only three studies reported a sample size calculation. Nonrandomized studies gave significantly higher estimates of improvement in structural outcome, and there was evidence of a significant publication bias. For structural outcome autologous (i.e. self-derived) stem cells were more effective than allogeneic (donor-derived) cells, but for functional outcome, the reverse was true. A significant dose-response relationship was observed only for structural outcome. For structural outcome, there was an absolute reduction in efficacy of 1.5% (-2.4 to -0.6) for each days delay to treatment; functional outcome was independent of the time of administration. While stem cells appear to be of some benefit in animal models of stroke the internal and external validity of this literature is potentially confounded by poor study quality and by publication bias. The clinical development of stem cell-based therapies, in stroke and elsewhere, should acknowledge these potential weaknesses in the supporting animal data.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of cognition and the presence of two hallmark lesions, senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which result from the accumulation and deposition of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively. Initially, it was thought that Abeta fibrils, which make up SP, were the root cause of the massive neurodegeneration usual found in AD brains. Over time, the longstanding emphasis on fibrillar Abeta deposits and neuronal death slowly gave way to a new paradigm involving soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta, which play a prominent role in triggering the cognitive deficits by specifically targeting synapses and disrupting synaptic signaling pathways. While this paradigm is widely accepted today in the AD field, the molecular details have not been fully elucidated. In this review, we address some of the important evidence, which has led to the Abeta oligomer-centric hypothesis as well as some of the key findings concerning the effects of Abeta oligomers on synapses at a morphological and functional level. Understanding how Abeta oligomers target synapses provides an important framework for ongoing AD research, which can lead to the development of successful therapeutic strategies designed to alter or perhaps reverse the course of the disease.

AB  - The mortality and morbidity associated with stroke makes the development of new drugs a research priority. Recent unsuccessful clinical trials have reduced enthusiasm for the development of neuroprotective drugs. Here, we use empirical evidence derived from systematic reviews of stroke drug development to identify stages of drug development which might be improved. We then propose exemplar strategies which may be helpful, along with some basic economic modelling of what the impact of such strategies might be. This suggests that relatively straightforward measures might reduce the costs of drug development by $5.8 bn or 31%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is used to counteract learned nonuse observed following stroke in humans and has been shown to improve function. Variations of CIMT used in animal models of stroke have the potential to inform and improve our understanding of this intervention. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies investigating constraint in experimental stroke. The authors aimed to assess the quality and establish the efficacy of constraint on neurobehavior, cognitive function, infarct size, and stress and mortality and to determine the optimal dose or time to administration. METHODS: Systematic review with meta-analysis was used. Data were analyzed using DerSimonian and Laird weighted-mean-difference random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The quality scores of the 8 articles (15 studies) included were moderate (median 5/10; interquartile range, 4.8-6.0). There was a trend for animals with constraint to have worse neurobehavioral scores (-10% worse; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -20 to 0; P = .06). Infarct volumes were not significantly different between groups (-3% larger with constraint; 95% CI = -15 to 9; P = .63). Cognitive function was significantly better after constraint, although this estimate was based on only 28 animals from 2 studies. Insufficient data prevented analysis of the effect of constraint on stress and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed no benefit of constraint on neurobehavioral scores, which is at odds with some human studies. Animal models may help us efficiently explore the biological basis of rehabilitation interventions; however, review of the data in this study raise uncertainty about its effectiveness in humans.

AB  - Early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD) is a condition characterized by early onset dementia (age at onset < 65 years) and a positive family history for dementia. To date, 230 mutations in presenilin (PS1, PS2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes have been identified in EOFAD. The mutations within these three genes (PS1/PS2/APP) affect a common pathogenic pathway in APP synthesis and proteolysis, which lead to excessive production of amyloid beta. Compared with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), EOFAD has some distinctive features including early age at onset, positive familial history, a variety of non-cognitive neurological symptoms and signs, and a more aggressive course. There is marked phenotypic heterogeneity among different mutations of EOFAD. Studies in presymptomatic mutation carriers reveal biomarkers abnormalities. EOFAD diagnosis is based on clinical and family history, neurological symptoms and examination, biomarker features, as well as genotyping in some cases. New therapeutic agents targeting amyloid formation may benefit EOFAD individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is a promising experimental treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Human trials are still at an early stage, with the focus now on using hypothermia in awake patients. Pethidine (meperidine) is the principle agent used to control shivering in humans; however, whether it has any modulating effects on the neuroprotective efficacy of hypothermia is unknown. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if pethidine influences the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia in experimental stroke. METHODS: Seventy-two male spontaneously hypertensive rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and randomly assigned to either normothermia (37. 4 degrees C rectal temperature); hypothermia (33 degrees C maintained for 130 mins); normothermia plus pethidine (2.5 mg/kg); or hypothermia plus pethidine. Temporary (90 mins) endovascular occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was induced blinded to treatment allocation and was confirmed with laser Doppler flowmetry. Pethidine and cooling were started immediately after vessel occlusion. Animals in the normothermia group had active temperature management using a heat lamp and fan. Assessments of outcome were carried out 24 after the induction of injury. RESULTS: Thirteen animals met our prespecified criteria for exclusion, and data for 59 rats were presented here. Hypothermia was associated with a 63% reduction in infarct size, and pethidine had no significant impact on the efficacy of hypothermia. No effects were observed in neurobehavioral outcome or edema volume across experimental groups.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, one of whose major pathological hallmarks is the accumulation of amyloid plaques comprised of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. It is now recognized that soluble Abeta oligomers may lead to synaptic dysfunctions early in AD pathology preceding plaque deposition. Abeta is produced by a sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the activity of beta- and gamma-secretases, which have been identified as major candidate therapeutic targets of AD. This paper focuses on how Abeta alters synaptic function and the functional consequences of inhibiting the activity of the two secretases responsible for Abeta generation. Abnormalities in synaptic function resulting from the absence or inhibition of the Abeta-producing enzymes suggest that Abeta itself may have normal physiological functions which are disrupted by abnormal accumulation of Abeta during AD pathology. This interpretation suggests that AD therapeutics targeting the beta- and gamma-secretases should be developed to restore normal levels of Abeta or combined with measures to circumvent the associated synaptic dysfunction(s) in order to have minimal impact on normal synaptic function.

AB  - Exposure to an enriched environment (EE) is beneficial to the structure and function of the brain. The added sensory, social, and spatial complexity of the EE also improves cognitive functions such as memory in both healthy brains and damaged or diseased brains, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of these cognitive improvements are poorly understood. In particular, studies that have examined the effects of EE on cellular function in the hippocampus, a structure critical for memory storage, have produced somewhat confusing results. Experiments performed in ex vivo hippocampal slices have reported a variety of EE effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity in both CA1 and the dentate gyrus. However, together with data from in vivo recordings made during and after the EE treatment, the overall results suggest an evolution of changes in neuronal function in the hippocampus, whereby there is an early transient increase in cell activity and plasticity that gives rise to more subtle long-term enhancements in cellular and network function that may contribute to enhanced hippocampus-dependent cognition.

AB  - In the past years, major efforts have been made to understand the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been translated into extensive experimental approaches aimed at slowing down or halting disease progression. Advances in transgenic (Tg) technologies allowed the engineering of different mouse models of AD recapitulating a range of AD-like features. These Tg models provided excellent opportunities to analyze the bases for the temporal evolution of the disease. Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of AD and that synapse loss is a pathological correlate associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, the phenotypic characterization of these animals has included electrophysiological studies to analyze hippocampal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, a widely recognized cellular model for learning and memory. Transgenic mice, along with non-Tg models derived mainly from exogenous application of Abeta, have also been useful experimental tools to test the various therapeutic approaches. As a result, numerous pharmacological interventions have been reported to attenuate synaptic dysfunction and improve behavior in the different AD models. To date, however, very few of these findings have resulted in target validation or successful translation into disease-modifying compounds in humans. Here, we will briefly review the synaptic alterations across the different animal models and we will recapitulate the pharmacological strategies aimed at rescuing hippocampal plasticity phenotypes. Finally, we will highlight intrinsic limitations in the use of experimental systems and related challenges in translating preclinical studies into human clinical trials.

AB  - The prevalence, associations, and natural history of pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) are poorly understood. The objective of this work was to study the prevalence of pain syndromes in MS both cross-sectionally, and longitudinally during the MS disease course. We systematically identified prospective studies detailing pain prevalence in definite MS. We used pooled prevalence estimates, explored heterogeneity using meta-regression, and analysed prevalence during the disease course using both estimates at disease milestones and longitudinal studies. Twenty-eight articles (7101 subjects) describing overall pain, or pain syndromes, met inclusion criteria. Pooled overall pain prevalence (17 studies, 5319 subjects) was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55-70%). Marked heterogeneity in this estimate was not significantly explained by selected study design variables (use of outpatient sample, timeframe prior to study over which pain was assessed) or sample demographic variables (mean Expanded Disability Status Scale, mean disease duration, proportion of female sex, and proportion with progressive MS). We quantified prevalence of headache (43%; 95% CI 33-52%), neuropathic extremity pain (26%; 95% CI 7-53%), back pain (20%; 95% CI 13-28%), painful spasms (15%; 95% CI 8.5-23%), Lhermitte sign (16%; 95% CI 10-25%), and trigeminal neuralgia (3.8%; 95% CI 2-6%) in included studies. Prevalence of pain at MS disease milestones (prior to onset, at onset, and at relapse) and during longitudinal follow-up was poorly described. Pain is common in MS, as are specific pain syndromes. The clinical associations and natural history of pain in MS require clarification. Future study could be enhanced by standardised study design.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Statistically significant studies may be cited more than negative studies on the same topic. We aimed to assess here whether such citation bias is present across the medical literature. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cohort study of the association between statistical significance and citations. We selected all therapeutic intervention studies included in meta-analyses published between January and March 2010 in the Cochrane database, and retrieved citation counts of all individual studies using ISI Web of Knowledge. The association between the statistical significance of each study and the number of citations it received between 2008 and 2010 was assessed in mixed Poisson models. RESULTS: We identified 89 research questions addressed in 458 eligible articles. Significant studies were cited twice as often as nonsignificant studies (multiplicative effect of significance: 2.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-3.33). This association was partly because of the higher impact factor of journals where significant studies are published (adjusted multiplicative effect of significance: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.87-1.51). CONCLUSION: A citation bias favoring significant results occurs in medical research. As a consequence, treatments may seem more effective to the readers of medical literature than they really are.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Sleep and circadian problems are very common in Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent animal studies suggest a bidirectional relationship between sleep and beta-amyloid (Abeta), a key molecule involved in AD pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To test whether Abeta deposition in preclinical AD, prior to the appearance of cognitive impairment, is associated with changes in quality or quantity of sleep. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted from October 2010 to June 2012. SETTING: General community volunteers at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively normal individuals (n = 145) 45 years and older were recruited from longitudinal studies of memory and aging at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Valid actigraphy data were recorded in 142. The majority (124 of 142) were recruited from the Adult Children Study, in which all were aged 45 to 75 years at baseline and 50% have a parental history of late-onset AD. The rest were recruited from a community volunteer cohort in which all were older than 60 years and healthy at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep was objectively measured using actigraphy for 2 weeks. Sleep efficiency, which is the percentage of time in bed spent asleep, was the primary measure of sleep quality. Total sleep time was the primary measure of sleep quantity. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels were used to determine whether amyloid deposition was present or absent. Concurrent sleep diaries provided nap information. RESULTS: Amyloid deposition, as assessed by Abeta42 levels, was present in 32 participants (22.5%). This group had worse sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency (80.4% vs 83.7%), compared with those without amyloid deposition, after correction for age, sex, and APOEepsilon4 allele carrier status (P = .04). In contrast, quantity of sleep was not significantly different between groups, as measured by total sleep time. Frequent napping, 3 or more days per week, was associated with amyloid deposition (31.2% vs 14.7%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Amyloid deposition in the preclinical stage of AD appears to be associated with worse sleep quality but not with changes in sleep quantity.

AB  - Pain can significantly decrease the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. Current treatment strategies often provide inadequate analgesia and unacceptable side effects. Animal models of bone cancer pain are used in the development of novel pharmacological approaches. Here we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of publications describing in vivo modelling of bone cancer pain in which behavioural, general health, macroscopic, histological, biochemical, or electrophysiological outcomes were reported and compared to appropriate controls. In all, 150 publications met our inclusion criteria, describing 38 different models of bone cancer pain. Reported methodological quality was low; only 31% of publications reported blinded assessment of outcome, and 11% reported random allocation to group. No publication reported a sample size calculation. Studies that reported measures to reduce bias reported smaller differences in behavioural outcomes between tumour-bearing and control animals, and studies that presented a statement regarding a conflict of interest reported larger differences in behavioural outcomes. Larger differences in behavioural outcomes were reported in female animals, when cancer cells were injected into either the tibia or femur, and when MatLyLu prostate or Lewis Lung cancer cells were used. Mechanical-evoked pain behaviours were most commonly reported; however, the largest difference was observed in spontaneous pain behaviours. In the spinal cord astrocyte activation and increased levels of Substance P receptor internalisation, c-Fos, dynorphin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta have been reported in bone cancer pain models, suggesting several potential therapeutic targets. However, the translational impact of animal models on clinical pain research could be enhanced by improving methodological quality.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which there is no cure, is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Despite tremendous efforts by the scientific community, the AD drug development pipeline remains extremely limited. Animal models of disease are a cornerstone of any drug development program and should be as relevant as possible to the disease, recapitulating the disease phenotype with high fidelity, to meaningfully contribute to the development of a successful therapeutic agent. Over the past two decades, transgenic models of AD based on the known genetic origins of familial AD have significantly contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of the disease. These models were extensively used in AD drug development. The numerous reported failures of new treatments for AD in clinical trials indicate that the use of genetic models of AD may not represent the complete picture of AD in humans and that other types of animal models relevant to the sporadic form of the disease, which represents 95% of AD cases, should be developed. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of non-transgenic rat models of AD and how these models may open new avenues for drug development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is currently only one clinically approved drug, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. The RhoA pathway, including RhoA and its downstream effector Rho kinase (ROCK), has been identified as a possible therapeutic target. Our aim was to assess the impact of study design characteristics and study quality on reported measures of efficacy and to assess for the presence and impact of publication bias. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on publications describing the efficacy of RhoA and ROCK inhibitors in animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia where outcome was assessed as a change in lesion size or neurobehavioural score, or both. RESULTS: We identified 25 published papers which met our inclusion criteria. RhoA and ROCK inhibitors reduced lesion size by 37.3% in models of focal cerebral ischaemia (95% CI, 28.6% to 46.0%, 41 comparisons), and reduced neurobehavioural data by 40.5% (33.4% to 47.7%, 30 comparisons). Overall study quality was low (median=4, interquartile range 3-5) and measures to reduce bias were seldom reported. Publication bias was prevalent and associated with a substantial overstatement of efficacy for lesion size. CONCLUSIONS: RhoA and ROCK inhibitors appear to be effective in animal models of stroke. However the low quality score, publication bias and limited number of studies are areas which need attention prior to conducting clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disease characterized by pathological proteolytic cleavage of tau protein, which appears to initiate death of the neurons. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a proteolytic fragment of the tau protein could serve as blood-based biomarker of cognitive function in AD. METHODS: We developed a highly sensitive ELISA assay specifically detecting an A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10)-generated fragment of tau (Tau-A). We characterized the assay in detail with to respect specificity and reactivity in healthy human serum. We used samples from the Tg4510 tau transgenic mice, which over-express the tau mutant P301L and exhibit a tauopathy with similarities to that observed in AD. We used serum samples from 21 well-characterized Alzheimer's patients, and we correlated the Tau-A levels to cognitive function. RESULTS: The Tau-A ELISA specifically detected the cleavage sequence at the N-terminus of a fragment of tau generated by ADAM10 with no cross-reactivity to intact tau or brain extracts. In brain extracts from Tg4510 mice compared to wt controls we found 10-fold higher levels of Tau-A (p<0.001), which indicates a pathological relevance of this marker. In serum from healthy individuals we found robust and reproducible levels of Tau-A, indicating that the analyte is present in serum. In serum from AD patients an inverse correlation (R(2) = 0.46, p<0.001) between the cognitive assessment score (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS)) and Tau-A levels was observed. CONCLUSION: Based on the hypothesis that tau is cleaved proteolytically and then released into the blood, we here provide evidence for the presence of an ADAM10-generated tau fragment (Tau-A) in serum. In addition, the levels of Tau-A showed an inverse correlation to cognitive function, which could indicate that this marker is a serum marker with pathological relevance for AD.

AB  - Functional and ultrastructural investigations support the concept that altered brain connectivity, exhausted neural plasticity, and synaptic loss are the strongest correlates of cognitive decline in age-related neurodegenerative dementia of Alzheimer's type. We have previously demonstrated that in transgenic mice, expressing amyloid-beta precursor protein-Swedish mutation active caspase-3 accumulates in hippocampal postsynaptic compartments leading to altered postsynaptic density (PSD) composition, increased long-term depression (LTD), and dendritic spine loss. Furthermore, we found strong evidence that dendritic spine alteration is mediated by calcineurin activation, a calcium-dependent phosphatase involved in synapse signaling. In the present work, we analyzed the molecular mechanism linking alteration of synaptic plasticity to the increase of calcineurin activity. We found that acute treatment of young and plaque-free transgenic mice with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 leads to a complete rescue of LTD and PSD composition. Our findings are in agreement with other results reporting that calcineurin inhibition improves memory function and restores dendritic spine density, confirming that calcineurin inhibition may be explored as a neuroprotective treatment to stop or slowdown synaptic alterations in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Animal studies generate valuable hypotheses that lead to the conduct of preventive or therapeutic clinical trials. We assessed whether there is evidence for excess statistical significance in results of animal studies on neurological disorders, suggesting biases. We used data from meta-analyses of interventions deposited in Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data in Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). The number of observed studies with statistically significant results (O) was compared with the expected number (E), based on the statistical power of each study under different assumptions for the plausible effect size. We assessed 4,445 datasets synthesized in 160 meta-analyses on Alzheimer disease (n = 2), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (n = 34), focal ischemia (n = 16), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 61), Parkinson disease (n = 45), and spinal cord injury (n = 2). 112 meta-analyses (70%) found nominally (p</=0.05) statistically significant summary fixed effects. Assuming the effect size in the most precise study to be a plausible effect, 919 out of 4,445 nominally significant results were expected versus 1,719 observed (p<10(-)(9)). Excess significance was present across all neurological disorders, in all subgroups defined by methodological characteristics, and also according to alternative plausible effects. Asymmetry tests also showed evidence of small-study effects in 74 (46%) meta-analyses. Significantly effective interventions with more than 500 animals, and no hints of bias were seen in eight (5%) meta-analyses. Overall, there are too many animal studies with statistically significant results in the literature of neurological disorders. This observation suggests strong biases, with selective analysis and outcome reporting biases being plausible explanations, and provides novel evidence on how these biases might influence the whole research domain of neurological animal literature.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that entails impairments of memory, thinking and behavior and culminates into brain atrophy. Impaired glucose uptake (accumulating into energy deficits) and synaptic plasticity have been shown to be affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This study examines the ability of lipoic acid to increase brain glucose uptake and lead to improvements in synaptic plasticity on a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) that shows progression of pathology as a function of age; two age groups: 6 months (young) and 12 months (old) were used in this study. 3xTg-AD mice fed 0.23% w/v lipoic acid in drinking water for 4 weeks showed an insulin mimetic effect that consisted of increased brain glucose uptake, activation of the insulin receptor substrate and of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Lipoic acid supplementation led to important changes in synaptic function as shown by increased input/output (I/O) and long term potentiation (LTP) (measured by electrophysiology). Lipoic acid was more effective in stimulating an insulin-like effect and reversing the impaired synaptic plasticity in the old mice, wherein the impairment of insulin signaling and synaptic plasticity was more pronounced than those in young mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that entails impairments of memory, thinking and behavior and culminates into brain atrophy. Impaired glucose uptake (accumulating into energy deficits) and synaptic plasticity have been shown to be affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This study examines the ability of lipoic acid to increase brain glucose uptake and lead to improvements in synaptic plasticity on a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) that shows progression of pathology as a function of age; two age groups: 6 months (young) and 12 months (old) were used in this study. 3xTg-AD mice fed 0.23% w/v lipoic acid in drinking water for 4 weeks showed an insulin mimetic effect that consisted of increased brain glucose uptake, activation of the insulin receptor substrate and of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Lipoic acid supplementation led to important changes in synaptic function as shown by increased input/output (I/O) and long term potentiation (LTP) (measured by electrophysiology). Lipoic acid was more effective in stimulating an insulin-like effect and reversing the impaired synaptic plasticity in the old mice, wherein the impairment of insulin signaling and synaptic plasticity was more pronounced than those in young mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia is a clinically useful neuroprotective therapy for cardiac arrest and neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and may potentially be useful for the treatment of other neurological conditions including traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The pre-clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of hypothermia in acute SCI broadly utilise either systemic hypothermia or cooling regional to the site of injury. The literature has not been uniformly positive with conflicting studies of varying quality, some performed decades previously. METHODS: In this study, we systematically review and meta-analyse the literature to determine the efficacy of systemic and regional hypothermia in traumatic SCI, the experimental conditions influencing this efficacy, and the influence of study quality on outcome. Three databases were utilised; PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Embase. Our inclusion criteria consisted of the (i) reporting of efficacy of hypothermia on functional outcome (ii) number of animals and (iii) mean outcome and variance in each group. RESULTS: Systemic hypothermia improved behavioural outcomes by 24.5% (95% CI 10.2 to 38.8) and a similar magnitude of improvement was seen across a number of high quality studies. The overall behavioural improvement with regional hypothermia was 26.2%, but the variance was wide (95% CI -3.77 to 56.2). This result may reflect a preponderance of positive low quality data, although a preferential effect of hypothermia in ischaemic models of injury may explain some of the disparate data. Sufficient heterogeneity was present between studies of regional hypothermia to reveal a number of factors potentially influencing efficacy, including depth and duration of hypothermia, animal species, and neurobehavioural assessment. However, these factors could reflect the influence of earlier lower quality literature. CONCLUSION: Systemic hypothermia appears to be a promising potential method of treating acute SCI on the basis of meta-analysis of the pre-clinical literature and the results of high quality animal studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Finding duplicates is an important phase of systematic review. However, no consensus regarding the methods to find duplicates has been provided. This study aims to describe a pragmatic strategy of combining auto- and hand-searching duplicates in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of duplicates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) were searched by the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. Duplicates included one index paper and one or more redundant papers. They were divided into type-I (duplicates among different databases) and type-II (duplicate publications in different journals/issues) duplicates. For type-I duplicates, reference items were further compared between index and redundant papers. Of 10936 papers regarding PVT, 2399 and 1307 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 11.0% (1201/10936) and 6.1% (665/10936), respectively. They included 3431 type-I and 275 type-II duplicates. Of 11403 papers regarding BCS, 3275 and 2064 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 14.4% (1640/11403) and 9.1% (1039/11403), respectively. They included 5053 type-I and 286 type-II duplicates. Most of type-I duplicates were identified by auto-searching method (69.5%, 2385/3431 in PVT literatures; 64.6%, 3263/5053 in BCS literatures). Nearly all type-II duplicates were identified by hand-searching method (94.9%, 261/275 in PVT literatures; 95.8%, 274/286 in BCS literatures). Compared with those identified by auto-searching method, type-I duplicates identified by hand-searching method had a significantly higher prevalence of wrong items (47/2385 versus 498/1046, p<0.0001 in PVT literatures; 30/3263 versus 778/1790, p<0.0001 in BCS literatures). Most of wrong items originated from EMBASE database. CONCLUSION: Given the inadequacy of a single strategy of auto-searching method, a combined strategy of auto- and hand-searching methods should be employed to find duplicates in systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of early decompression in the management of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains contentious despite many pre-clinical studies demonstrating benefits and a small number of supportive clinical studies. Although the pre-clinical literature favours the concept of early decompression, translation is hindered by uncertainties regarding overall treatment efficacy and timing of decompression. METHODS: We performed meta-analysis to examine the pre-clinical literature on acute decompression of the injured spinal cord. Three databases were utilised; PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Embase. Our inclusion criteria consisted of (i) the reporting of efficacy of decompression at various time intervals (ii) number of animals and (iii) the mean outcome and variance in each group. Random effects meta-analysis was used and the impact of study design characteristics assessed with meta-regression. RESULTS: Overall, decompression improved behavioural outcome by 35.1% (95%CI 27.4-42.8; I(2)=94%, p<0.001). Measures to minimise bias were not routinely reported with blinding associated with a smaller but still significant benefit. Publication bias likely also contributed to an overestimation of efficacy. Meta-regression demonstrated a number of factors affecting outcome, notably compressive pressure and duration (adjusted r(2)=0.204, p<0.002), with increased pressure and longer durations of compression associated with smaller treatment effects. Plotting the compressive pressure against the duration of compression resulting in paraplegia in individual studies revealed a power law relationship; high compressive forces quickly resulted in paraplegia, while low compressive forces accompanying canal narrowing resulted in paresis over many hours. CONCLUSION: These data suggest early decompression improves neurobehavioural deficits in animal models of SCI. Although much of the literature had limited internal validity, benefit was maintained across high quality studies. The close relationship of compressive pressure to the rate of development of severe neurological injury suggests that pressure local to the site of injury might be a useful parameter determining the urgency of decompression.

AB  - Soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers impair synaptic plasticity and cause synaptic loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report that murine PirB (paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B) and its human ortholog LilrB2 (leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2), present in human brain, are receptors for Abeta oligomers, with nanomolar affinity. The first two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of PirB and LilrB2 mediate this interaction, leading to enhanced cofilin signaling, also seen in human AD brains. In mice, the deleterious effect of Abeta oligomers on hippocampal long-term potentiation required PirB, and in a transgenic model of AD, PirB not only contributed to memory deficits present in adult mice, but also mediated loss of synaptic plasticity in juvenile visual cortex. These findings imply that LilrB2 contributes to human AD neuropathology and suggest therapeutic uses of blocking LilrB2 function.

The first two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of PirB and LilrB2 mediate this interaction, leading to enhanced cofilin signaling, also seen in human AD brains. In mice, the deleterious effect of Abeta oligomers on hippocampal long-term potentiation required PirB, and in a transgenic model of AD, PirB not only contributed to memory deficits present in adult mice, but also mediated loss of synaptic plasticity in juvenile visual cortex. These findings imply that LilrB2 contributes to human AD neuropathology and suggest therapeutic uses of blocking LilrB2 function.

AB  - Transgenic mice that accumulate Abeta peptides in the CNS are commonly used to interrogate functional consequences of Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloidopathy. In addition to changes to synaptic function, there is also growing evidence that changes to intrinsic excitability of neurones can arise in these models of amyloidopathy. Furthermore, some of these alterations to intrinsic properties may occur relatively early within the age-related progression of experimental amyloidopathy. Here we report a detailed comparison between the intrinsic excitability properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones in wild-type (WT) and PDAPP mice. The latter is a well-established model of Abeta accumulation which expresses human APP harbouring the Indiana (V717F) mutation. At the age employed in this study (9-10 months) CNS Abeta was elevated in PDAPP mice but significant plaque pathology was absent. PDAPP mice exhibited no differences in subthreshold intrinsic properties including resting potential, input resistance, membrane time constant and sag. When CA1 cells of PDAPP mice were given depolarizing stimuli of various amplitudes they initially fired at a higher frequency than WT cells. Commensurate with this, PDAPP cells exhibited a larger fast afterdepolarizing potential. PDAPP mice had narrower spikes but action potential threshold, rate of rise and peak were not different. Thus not all changes seen in our previous studies of amyloidopathy models were present in PDAPP mice; however, narrower spikes, larger ADPs and the propensity to fire at higher frequencies were consistent with our prior work and thus may represent robust, cross-model, indices of amyloidopathy.

AB  - The Cochrane Collaboration was established in 1993, following the opening of the UK Cochrane Centre in 1992, at a time when searching for studies for inclusion in systematic reviews was not well-developed. Review authors largely conducted their own searches or depended on medical librarians, who often possessed limited awareness and experience of systematic reviews. Guidance on the conduct and reporting of searches was limited. When work began to identify reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion in Cochrane Reviews in 1992, there were only approximately 20,000 reports indexed as RCTs in MEDLINE and none indexed as RCTs in Embase. No search filters had been developed with the aim of identifying all RCTs in MEDLINE or other major databases. This presented The Cochrane Collaboration with a considerable challenge in identifying relevant studies.Over time, the number of studies indexed as RCTs in the major databases has grown considerably and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) has become the best single source of published controlled trials, with approximately 700,000 records, including records identified by the Collaboration from Embase and MEDLINE. Search filters for various study types, including systematic reviews and the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategies for RCTs, have been developed. There have been considerable advances in the evidence base for methodological aspects of information retrieval. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions now provides detailed guidance on the conduct and reporting of searches. Initiatives across The Cochrane Collaboration to improve the quality inter alia of information retrieval include: the recently introduced Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) programme, which stipulates 'mandatory' and 'highly desirable' standards for various aspects of review conduct and reporting including searching, the development of Standard Training Materials for Cochrane Reviews and work on peer review of electronic search strategies. Almost all Cochrane Review Groups and some Cochrane Centres and Fields now have a Trials Search Co-ordinator responsible for study identification and medical librarians and other information specialists are increasingly experienced in searching for studies for systematic reviews.Prospective registration of clinical trials is increasing and searching trials registers is now mandatory for Cochrane Reviews, where relevant. Portals such as the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) are likely to become increasingly attractive, given concerns about the number of trials which may not be registered and/or published. The importance of access to information from regulatory and reimbursement agencies is likely to increase. Cross-database searching, gateways or portals and improved access to full-text databases will impact on how searches are conducted and reported, as will services such as Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science. Technologies such as textual analysis, semantic analysis, text mining and data linkage will have a major impact on the search process but efficient and effective updating of reviews may remain a challenge.In twenty years' time, we envisage that the impact of universal social networking, as well as national and international legislation, will mean that all trials involving humans will be registered at inception and detailed trial results will be routinely available to all. Challenges will remain, however, to ensure the discoverability of relevant information in diverse and often complex sources and the availability of metadata to provide the most efficient access to information. We envisage an ongoing role for information professionals as experts in identifying new resources, researching efficient ways to link or mine them for relevant data and managing their content for the efficient production of systematic reviews.

AB  - Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that overproduce the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) have highlighted impairments of hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity associated with the progression of the disease. Here we examined whether the characteristics of one of the hallmarks of AD, i.e. Abeta deposition, in both the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus, correlated with specific losses of synaptic plasticity in these areas. For this, we evaluated the occurrence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the cortex and the hippocampus of 6-month old 5xFAD transgenic mice that exhibited massive Abeta deposition in both regions but with different features: in cortical areas a majority of Abeta deposits comprised a dense core surrounded by a diffuse corona while such kind of Abeta deposition was less frequently observed in the hippocampus. In order to simultaneously monitor synaptic changes in both areas, we developed a method based on the use of Multi-Electrode Arrays (MEA). When compared with wild-type (WT) mice, basal transmission was significantly reduced in both areas in 5xFAD mice, while short-term synaptic plasticity was unaffected. The induction of long-term changes of synaptic transmission by different protocols revealed that in 5xFAD mice, LTP in the layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex was more severely impaired than LTP triggered in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. We conclude that cortical plasticity is deficient in the 5xFAD model and that this deficit could be correlated with the proportion of diffuse plaques in 5xFAD mice.

AB  - Dietary manipulations are increasingly viewed as possible approaches to treating neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients present an energy imbalance with brain hypometabolism and mitochondrial deficits. Ketogenic diets (KDs), widely investigated in the treatment and prevention of seizures, have been suggested to bypass metabolic deficits present in AD brain by providing ketone bodies as an alternative fuel to neurons. We investigated the effects of a ketogenic diet in two transgenic mouse lines. Five months old APP/PS1 (a model of amyloid deposition) and Tg4510 (a model of tau deposition) mice were offered either a ketogenic or a control (NIH-31) diet for 3 months. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the experiment, and blood was collected at 4 weeks and 4 months for ketone and glucose assessments. Both lines of transgenic mice weighed less than nontransgenic mice, yet, surprisingly, had elevated food intake. The ketogenic diet did not affect these differences in body weight or food consumption. Behavioral testing during the last two weeks of treatment found that mice offered KD performed significantly better on the rotarod compared to mice on the control diet independent of genotype. In the open field test, both transgenic mouse lines presented increased locomotor activity compared to nontransgenic, age-matched controls, and this effect was not influenced by KD. The radial arm water maze identified learning deficits in both transgenic lines with no significant differences between diets. Tissue measures of amyloid, tau, astroglial and microglial markers in transgenic lines showed no differences between animals fed the control or the ketogenic diet. These data suggest that ketogenic diets may play an important role in enhancing motor performance in mice, but have minimal impact on the phenotype of murine models of amyloid or tau deposition.

AB  - Dietary manipulations are increasingly viewed as possible approaches to treating neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients present an energy imbalance with brain hypometabolism and mitochondrial deficits. Ketogenic diets (KDs), widely investigated in the treatment and prevention of seizures, have been suggested to bypass metabolic deficits present in AD brain by providing ketone bodies as an alternative fuel to neurons. We investigated the effects of a ketogenic diet in two transgenic mouse lines. Five months old APP/PS1 (a model of amyloid deposition) and Tg4510 (a model of tau deposition) mice were offered either a ketogenic or a control (NIH-31) diet for 3 months. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the experiment, and blood was collected at 4 weeks and 4 months for ketone and glucose assessments. Both lines of transgenic mice weighed less than nontransgenic mice, yet, surprisingly, had elevated food intake. The ketogenic diet did not affect these differences in body weight or food consumption. Behavioral testing during the last two weeks of treatment found that mice offered KD performed significantly better on the rotarod compared to mice on the control diet independent of genotype. In the open field test, both transgenic mouse lines presented increased locomotor activity compared to nontransgenic, age-matched controls, and this effect was not influenced by KD. The radial arm water maze identified learning deficits in both transgenic lines with no significant differences between diets. Tissue measures of amyloid, tau, astroglial and microglial markers in transgenic lines showed no differences between animals fed the control or the ketogenic diet. These data suggest that ketogenic diets may play an important role in enhancing motor performance in mice, but have minimal impact on the phenotype of murine models of amyloid or tau deposition.

AB  - For the last 20 years, the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" has dominated research aimed at understanding, preventing, and curing Alzheimer's disease (AD). During that time researchers have acquired an enormous amount of data and have been successful, more than 300 times, in curing the disease in animal model systems by treatments aimed at clearing amyloid deposits. However, to date similar strategies have not been successful in human AD patients. Hence, before rushing into further clinical trials with compounds that aim at lowering amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in increasingly younger people, it would be of highest priority to re-assess the initial assumption that accumulation of Abeta in the brain is the primary pathological event driving AD. Here we question this assumption by highlighting experimental evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis suggesting that APP and Abeta are part of a neuronal stress/injury system, which is up-regulated to counteract inflammation/oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration that could be triggered by a brain injury, chronic infections, or a systemic disease. In AD, this protective program may be overridden by genetic and other risk factors, or its maintenance may become dysregulated during aging. Here, we provide a hypothetical example of a hypothesis-driven correlation between car accidents and airbag release in analogy to the evolution of the amyloid focus and as a way to offer a potential explanation for the failure of the AD field to translate the success of amyloid-related therapeutic strategies in experimental models to the clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal models closely resembling the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed for research on disease mechanisms and for drug development. No natural model of AD is available, so big hopes arose from transgenic and knockout technology, expecting that modulation and expression of pathogenetically important proteins resemble human brain pathology and functional deficits in the expected morphological and temporal pattern. OBJECTIVE: The real usefulness of these models should be discussed from an objective point of view. RESULTS: Not a single one of the published transgenic rodent models fulfils this hope, and even complex multiple transgenic animals do not suffer from real AD. It is crucial to be aware that all of the commonly used mice and rats are just models, and therefore results from drug efficacy testing have to be interpreted with care. Repeated experience with failed trials of new treatments that previously had been published as successful in animals has led to the wrong conclusion that animal models are of low predictive value or even of no use. Often clinical trials replicate exactly what was shown in the animal proof-of-concept studies. CONCLUSION: The value of animal models depends mainly on the careful experimentation and correct interpretation of results. Appropriate planning of experiments will help to increase the predictive value in drug development programs, though this may also increase negative findings. However, the early failure may enable a faster focus on more promising strategies.

AB  - Research publication can both communicate and miscommunicate. Unless research is adequately reported, the time and resources invested in the conduct of research is wasted. Reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, STARD, PRISMA, and ARRIVE aim to improve the quality of research reports, but all are much less adopted and adhered to than they should be. Adequate reports of research should clearly describe which questions were addressed and why, what was done, what was shown, and what the findings mean. However, substantial failures occur in each of these elements. For example, studies of published trial reports showed that the poor description of interventions meant that 40-89% were non-replicable; comparisons of protocols with publications showed that most studies had at least one primary outcome changed, introduced, or omitted; and investigators of new trials rarely set their findings in the context of a systematic review, and cited a very small and biased selection of previous relevant trials. Although best documented in reports of controlled trials, inadequate reporting occurs in all types of studies-animal and other preclinical studies, diagnostic studies, epidemiological studies, clinical prediction research, surveys, and qualitative studies. In this report, and in the Series more generally, we point to a waste at all stages in medical research. Although a more nuanced understanding of the complex systems involved in the conduct, writing, and publication of research is desirable, some immediate action can be taken to improve the reporting of research. Evidence for some recommendations is clear: change the current system of research rewards and regulations to encourage better and more complete reporting, and fund the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support better reporting, linkage, and archiving of all elements of research. However, the high amount of waste also warrants future investment in the monitoring of and research into reporting of research, and active implementation of the findings to ensure that research reports better address the needs of the range of research users.

AB  - We recently designed and deployed a metasearch engine, Metta, that sends queries and retrieves search results from five leading biomedical databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Because many articles are indexed in more than one of these databases, it is desirable to deduplicate the retrieved article records. This is not a trivial problem because data fields contain a lot of missing and erroneous entries, and because certain types of information are recorded differently (and inconsistently) in the different databases. The present report describes our rule-based method for deduplicating article records across databases and includes an open-source script module that can be deployed freely. Metta was designed to satisfy the particular needs of people who are writing systematic reviews in evidence-based medicine. These users want the highest possible recall in retrieval, so it is important to err on the side of not deduplicating any records that refer to distinct articles, and it is important to perform deduplication online in real time. Our deduplication module is designed with these constraints in mind. Articles that share the same publication year are compared sequentially on parameters including PubMed ID number, digital object identifier, journal name, article title and author list, using text approximation techniques. In a review of Metta searches carried out by public users, we found that the deduplication module was more effective at identifying duplicates than EndNote without making any erroneous assignments.

AB  - The use of systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies has become more common, including those of studies describing the modeling of cerebrovascular diseases. Empirical evidence suggests that too many preclinical experiments lack methodological rigor, and this leads to inflated treatment effects. The aim of this review is to describe the concepts of systematic review and meta-analysis and consider how these tools may be used to provide empirical evidence to spur the field to improve the rigor of the conduct and reporting of preclinical research akin to their use in improving the conduct and reporting of randomized controlled trials in clinical research. As with other research domains, systematic reviews are subject to bias. Therefore, we have also suggested guidance for their conduct, reporting, and critical appraisal.

AB  - Tau alterations are now considered an executor of neuronal demise and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mouse models combining amyloidosis and tauopathy and their parental counterparts are important tools to further investigate the interplay of abnormal amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Tau species in pathogenesis, synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Here, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with 5 early-onset familial AD mutations (5xFAD) and TauP301S (PS19) transgenic mice, denoted F(+)/T(+) mice, and phenotypically compared them to their respective parental strains, denoted F(+)/T(-) and F(-)/T(+) respectively, as controls. We found dramatically aggravated tauopathy (~10-fold) in F(+)/T(+) mice compared to the parental F(-)/T(+) mice. In contrast, amyloidosis was unaltered compared to the parental F(+)/T(-) mice. Tauopathy was invariably and very robustly aggravated in hippocampal and cortical brain regions. Most important, F(+)/T(+) displayed aggravated cognitive deficits in a hippocampus-dependent spatial navigation task, compared to the parental F(+)/T(-) strain, while parental F(-)/T(+) mice did not display cognitive impairment. Basal synaptic transmission was impaired in F(+)/T(+) mice compared to nontransgenic mice and the parental strains (>/=40%). Finally, F(+)/T(+) mice displayed a significant hippocampal atrophy (~20%) compared to nontransgenic mice, in contrast to the parental strains. Our data indicate for the first time that pathological Abeta species (or APP/PS1) induced changes in Tau contribute to cognitive deficits correlating with synaptic deficits and hippocampal atrophy in an AD model. Our data lend support to the amyloid cascade hypothesis with a role of pathological Abeta species as initiator and pathological Tau species as executor.

AB  - Without a complete published description of interventions, clinicians and patients cannot reliably implement interventions that are shown to be useful, and other researchers cannot replicate or build on research findings. The quality of description of interventions in publications, however, is remarkably poor. To improve the completeness of reporting, and ultimately the replicability, of interventions, an international group of experts and stakeholders developed the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The process involved a literature review for relevant checklists and research, a Delphi survey of an international panel of experts to guide item selection, and a face to face panel meeting. The resultant 12 item TIDieR checklist (brief name, why, what (materials), what (procedure), who provided, how, where, when and how much, tailoring, modifications, how well (planned), how well (actual)) is an extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement (item 5) and the SPIRIT 2013 statement (item 11). While the emphasis of the checklist is on trials, the guidance is intended to apply across all evaluative study designs. This paper presents the TIDieR checklist and guide, with an explanation and elaboration for each item, and examples of good reporting. The TIDieR checklist and guide should improve the reporting of interventions and make it easier for authors to structure accounts of their interventions, reviewers and editors to assess the descriptions, and readers to use the information.

AB  - Thanks to the discovery of novel technologies and sophisticated analysis tools we can now 'see' molecules, genes and even patterns of gene expression, which have resulted in major advances in many areas of biology. Recently, similar technologies have been developed for behavioral studies. However, the wide implementation of such technological progress in behavioral research remains behind, as if there are inhibiting factors for accepting and adopting available innovations. The methods of the majority of studies measuring and interpreting behavior of laboratory animals seem to have frozen in time somewhere in the last century. As an example of the so-called classical tests, we will present the history and shortcomings of one of the most frequently used tests, the open field. Similar objections and critical remarks, however, can be made with regard to the elevated plus maze, light-dark box, various other mazes, object recognition tests, etc. Possible solutions and recommendations on how progress in behavioral neuroscience can be achieved and accelerated will be discussed in the second part of this review.

AB  - Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a hematopoietic cytokine that also possesses neurotrophic and antiapoptotic properties. G-CSF has been reported to decrease amyloid burden significantly, promote hippocampal neurogenesis, and improve spatial learning in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. To understand better the effects of G-CSF on hippocampal-dependent learning, the present study focused on electrophysiological correlates of neuroplasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), and long-term depression (LTD). Two cohorts of transgenic APP/PS1 mice, with or without prior bone marrow transplantation from Tg GFP mice, were treated in vivo for 2 weeks with G-CSF or vehicle. After completion of the treatments, hippocampal slices were prepared for electrophysiological studies of LTP and LTD. LTP was induced and maintained in both G-CSF-treated and vehicle-treated groups of Tg APP/PS1. In contrast, LTD could not be induced in vehicle-treated Tg APP/PS1 mice, but G-CSF treatment restored LTD. The LTP and LTD results obtained from the cohort of bone marrow-grafted Tg APP/PS1 mice did not differ from those from nongrafted Tg APP/PS1 mice. The mechanism by which G-CSF restores LTD is not known, but it is possible that its capacity to reduce amyloid plaques results in increased soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (A-beta), which in turn may facilitate LTD. This mechanism would be consistent with the recent report that soluble A-beta oligomers promote LTD in hippocampal slices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The methodological quality of animal studies is an important factor hampering the translation of results from animal studies to a clinical setting. Systematic reviews of animal studies may provide a suitable method to assess and thereby improve their methodological quality. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the risk of bias assessment in animal-based systematic reviews, and 2) to study the internal validity of the primary animal studies included in these systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched Pubmed and Embase for SRs of preclinical animal studies published between 2005 and 2012. RESULTS: A total of 91 systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed in 48 (52.7%) of these 91 systematic reviews. Thirty-three (36.3%) SRs provided sufficient information to evaluate the internal validity of the included studies. Of the evaluated primary studies, 24.6% was randomized, 14.6% reported blinding of the investigator/caretaker, 23.9% blinded the outcome assessment, and 23.1% reported drop-outs. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the translation of animal data to clinical practice, systematic reviews of animal studies are worthwhile, but the internal validity of primary animal studies needs to be improved. Furthermore, risk of bias should be assessed by systematic reviews of animal studies to provide insight into the reliability of the available evidence.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common type of dementia among elderly people. Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in extracellular Abeta plaques, produced from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via sequential processing by beta- and gamma-secretases, impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and cause cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. Here, we report that Abeta peptides also impair another form of synaptic plasticity; cerebellar long-term depression (LTD). In the cerebellum of commonly used AD mouse model, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, Abeta plaques were detected from 8 months and profound accumulation of Abeta plaques was observed at 18 onths of age. Biochemical analysis revealed relatively high levels of APP protein and Abeta in the cerebellum of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. At pre-Abeta accumulation stage, LTD induction, and motor coordination are disturbed. These results indicate that soluble Abeta oligomers disturb LTD induction and cerebellar function in AD mouse model.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common type of dementia among elderly people. Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in extracellular Abeta plaques, produced from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via sequential processing by beta- and gamma-secretases, impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and cause cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. Here, we report that Abeta peptides also impair another form of synaptic plasticity; cerebellar long-term depression (LTD). In the cerebellum of commonly used AD mouse model, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, Abeta plaques were detected from 8 months and profound accumulation of Abeta plaques was observed at 18 onths of age. Biochemical analysis revealed relatively high levels of APP protein and Abeta in the cerebellum of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. At pre-Abeta accumulation stage, LTD induction, and motor coordination are disturbed. These results indicate that soluble Abeta oligomers disturb LTD induction and cerebellar function in AD mouse model.

AB  - The goal of this review is to discuss how behavioral tests in mice relate to the pathological and neuropsychological features seen in human Alzheimer's disease (AD), and present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal progression of behavioral impairments in commonly used AD mouse models that contain mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP). We begin with a brief overview of the neuropathological changes seen in the AD brain and an outline of some of the clinical neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This is followed by a critical assessment of behavioral tasks that are used in AD mice to model the cognitive changes seen in the human disease. Behavioral tests discussed include spatial memory tests [Morris water maze (MWM), radial arm water maze (RAWM), Barnes maze], associative learning tasks (passive avoidance, fear conditioning), alternation tasks (Y-Maze/T-Maze), recognition memory tasks (Novel Object Recognition), attentional tasks (3 and 5 choice serial reaction time), set-shifting tasks, and reversal learning tasks. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these behavioral tasks, and how they may correlate with clinical assessments in humans. Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in 10 AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1 (M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5xFAD, and 3xTg-AD) are discussed in detail. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression and are a useful tool to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.

AB  - In animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mechanisms of cortical plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are impaired. In AD patients, LTP-like cortical plasticity is abolished, whereas LTD seems to be preserved. Dopaminergic transmission has been hypothesized as a new player in ruling mechanisms of cortical plasticity in AD. We aimed at investigating whether administration of the dopamine agonist rotigotine (RTG) could modulate cortical plasticity in AD patients, as measured by theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocols of repetitive transcranial stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex. Thirty mild AD patients were tested in three different groups before and after 4 weeks of treatment with RTG, rivastigmine (RVT), or placebo (PLC). Each patient was evaluated for plasticity induction of LTP/LTD-like effects using respectively intermittent TBS (iTBS) or continuous TBS protocols. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) protocol was performed to indirectly assess central cholinergic activity. A group of age-matched healthy controls was recruited for baseline comparisons. Results showed that at baseline, AD patients were characterized by impaired LTP-like cortical plasticity, as assessed by iTBS. These reduced levels of LTP-like cortical plasticity were increased and normalized after RTG administration. No effect was induced by RVT or PLC on LTP. LTD-like cortical plasticity was not modulated in any condition. Cholinergic activity was increased by both RTG and RVT. Our findings reveal that dopamine agonists may restore the altered mechanisms of LTP-like cortical plasticity in AD patients, thus providing novel implications for therapies based on dopaminergic stimulation.

AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) was shown previously to improve cognition and decrease pathology in transgenic mouse models with Alzheimer-like amyloid deposition. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CR on the Tg4510 model of tau deposition. Mice in the calorie restriction group had food intake gradually decreased until they reached an average of 35% body weight reduction. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the study. After being on their respective diets for 3 months, all animals were submitted to behavioral testing. Tg4510 mice fed ad libitum showed lower body weight than nontransgenic littermates despite their increased food intake. Additionally, Tg4510 showed increased locomotor activity in the open field regardless of diet. Calorie restricted Tg4510 mice performed significantly better than ad libitum fed mice in the novel object recognition test, suggesting improved short-term memory. CR Tg4510 mice also performed significantly better in contextual fear conditioning than mice fed ad libitum. However, in a modified version of the novelty test that allows for interaction with other mice instead of inanimate objects, CR was not able to rescue the deficit found in Tg4510 mice in this ethologically more salient version of the task. No treatment differences in motor performance or spatial memory were observed in the rotarod or radial arm water maze tests, respectively. Histopathological and biochemical assessments showed no diet-induced changes in total or phospho-tau levels. Moreover, increased activation of both astrocytes and microglia in Tg4510 mice was not rescued by calorie restriction. Taken together, our data suggests that, despite an apparent rescue of associative memory, CR had no consistent effects on pathological outcomes of a mouse model of tau deposition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of not blinding outcome assessors on estimates of intervention effects in animal experiments modeling human clinical conditions. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched PubMed, Biosis, Google Scholar, and HighWire Press and included animal model experiments with both blinded and nonblinded outcome assessors. For each experiment, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios (ROR), that is, the odds ratio (OR) from nonblinded assessments relative to the corresponding OR from blinded assessments. We standardized the ORs according to the experimental hypothesis, such that an ROR <1 indicates that nonblinded assessor exaggerated intervention effect, that is, exaggerated benefit in experiments investigating possible benefit or exaggerated harm in experiments investigating possible harm. We pooled RORs with inverse variance random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 10 (2,450 animals) experiments in the main meta-analysis. Outcomes were subjective in most experiments. The pooled ROR was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20, 0.82; I(2) = 75%; P < 0.001), indicating an average exaggeration of the nonblinded ORs by 59%. The heterogeneity was quantitative and caused by three pesticides experiments with very large observer bias, pooled ROR was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.07, 0.59) in contrast to the pooled ROR in the other seven experiments, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.57, 1.17). CONCLUSION: Lack of blinding of outcome assessors in animal model experiments with subjective outcomes implies a considerable risk of observer bias.

AB  - Transgenic mice expressing mutations in tau have yielded essential discoveries for Alzheimer's disease. One of the most commonly used tau mouse models is the tet-off Tg(tauP301L)4510 model that expresses P301L human tau driven by the calcium-calmodulin kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) promoter system. Tau expression in this model is regulatable, allowing for suppression of mutant tau expression until adulthood and prevention of possible developmental alterations resulting from P301L tau expression during development. Here, we compared the effect and sample sizes needed for three learning and memory tasks in mice with adult-onset P301L tau expression. Our findings indicate that the Incremental Repeated Acquisition (IRA) and trace fear conditioning tasks, neither of which have previously been published with these mice, were highly sensitive to P301L tau expression, whereas the Morris water maze, the most commonly used task with this model, was the least sensitive. Memory deficits were observed at a time when tau pathology was subtle and prior to readily detectable neuronal loss. Thus, we provide essential information (effect and sample sizes needed) for establishing experimental designs at a time point when memory deficits are likely to go undetected if inadequate sample sizes are used. Our work also suggests the tet-off Tg4510 model provides a way to avoid mutant tau expression during the perinatal and early postnatal stages, thereby preventing possible developmental alterations unrelated to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to affect 50% of individuals reaching 85 years of age. The most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the e4 allele of APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E, a lipid carrier shown to modulate brain amyloid burden. Recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AD susceptibility, including those in the CLU and BIN1 genes encoding for clusterin (CLU) and the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) proteins, respectively. Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered Abeta42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was recently found to play a critical role in memory consolidation in rats and mice, and hippocampal or systemic administration of recombinant IGF2 enhances memory. Here, using a gene therapy-based approach with adeno-associated virus (AAV), we show that IGF2 overexpression in the hippocampus of aged wild-type mice enhances memory and promotes dendritic spine formation. Furthermore, we report that IGF2 expression decreases in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and this leads us to hypothesize that increased IGF2 levels may be beneficial for treating the disease. Thus, we used the AAV system to deliver IGF2 or IGF1 into the hippocampus of the APP mouse model Tg2576 and demonstrate that IGF2 and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) rescue behavioural deficits, promote dendritic spine formation and restore normal hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission. The brains of Tg2576 mice that overexpress IGF2 but not IGF1 also show a significant reduction in amyloid levels. This reduction probably occurs through an interaction with the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R). Hence, IGF2 and, to a lesser extent, IGF1 may be effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was recently found to play a critical role in memory consolidation in rats and mice, and hippocampal or systemic administration of recombinant IGF2 enhances memory. Here, using a gene therapy-based approach with adeno-associated virus (AAV), we show that IGF2 overexpression in the hippocampus of aged wild-type mice enhances memory and promotes dendritic spine formation. Furthermore, we report that IGF2 expression decreases in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and this leads us to hypothesize that increased IGF2 levels may be beneficial for treating the disease. Thus, we used the AAV system to deliver IGF2 or IGF1 into the hippocampus of the APP mouse model Tg2576 and demonstrate that IGF2 and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) rescue behavioural deficits, promote dendritic spine formation and restore normal hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission. The brains of Tg2576 mice that overexpress IGF2 but not IGF1 also show a significant reduction in amyloid levels. This reduction probably occurs through an interaction with the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R). Hence, IGF2 and, to a lesser extent, IGF1 may be effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - To characterize the mechanisms underlying region- and age-dependent hippocampal synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, we used transgenic CRND8 mice, expressing the Swedish-Indiana APP mutation. In 2-month-old mice, no beta-amyloid plaques deposition, but the presence of soluble oligomers, were found in CA1 area but not in dentate gyrus (DG). At this age, long-term potentiation (LTP) was reduced selectively in CA1. In 6-month-old mice, the presence of soluble oligomers was accompanied by accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and decreased LTP in CA1 and DG regions. In both regions, the loss of LTP was linked to reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) current ratio. The acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor, neostigmine rescued LTP in CA1 area at early stage of the disease but not after plaques deposition. Conversely, the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine restored LTP selectively in DG at later stages of the disease. Both these effects were associated with a normalization of the NMDA to AMPA ratio. The association between the recovery of LTP and the normalization of the NMDA to AMPA ratio provides information on new possible therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although altered lipid metabolism has been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) through cell biological, epidemiological, and genetic studies, the molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol and AD pathology are still not well understood and contradictory results have been reported. We have used a Mendelian randomization approach to dissect the causal nature of the association between circulating lipid levels and late onset AD (LOAD) and test the hypothesis that genetically raised lipid levels increase the risk of LOAD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included 3,914 patients with LOAD, 1,675 older individuals without LOAD, and 4,989 individuals from the general population from six genome wide studies drawn from a white population (total n=10,578). We constructed weighted genotype risk scores (GRSs) for four blood lipid phenotypes (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], triglycerides, and total cholesterol) using well-established SNPs in 157 loci for blood lipids reported by Willer and colleagues (2013). Both full GRSs using all SNPs associated with each trait at p<5×10-8 and trait specific scores using SNPs associated exclusively with each trait at p<5 × 10-8 were developed. We used logistic regression to investigate whether the GRSs were associated with LOAD in each study and results were combined together by meta-analysis. We found no association between any of the full GRSs and LOAD (meta-analysis results: odds ratio [OR]=1.005, 95% CI 0.82-1.24, p = 0.962 per 1 unit increase in HDL-c; OR=0.901, 95% CI 0.65-1.25, p=0.530 per 1 unit increase in LDL-c; OR=1.104, 95% CI 0.89-1.37, p=0.362 per 1 unit increase in triglycerides; and OR=0.954, 95% CI 0.76-1.21, p=0.688 per 1 unit increase in total cholesterol). Results for the trait specific scores were similar; however, the trait specific scores explained much smaller phenotypic variance. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to increased blood cholesterol and triglyceride lipid levels is not associated with elevated LOAD risk. The observed epidemiological associations between abnormal lipid levels and LOAD risk could therefore be attributed to the result of biological pleiotropy or could be secondary to LOAD. Limitations of this study include the small proportion of lipid variance explained by the GRS, biases in case-control ascertainment, and the limitations implicit to Mendelian randomization studies. Future studies should focus on larger LOAD datasets with longitudinal sampled peripheral lipid measures and other markers of lipid metabolism, which have been shown to be altered in LOAD.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is believed to directly affect memory and learning in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is widely suggested that there is a relationship between Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and cognitive performance. In order to explore the validity of this relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of 40 peer-reviewed, published AD transgenic mouse studies that quantitatively measured Abeta levels in brain tissue after assessing cognitive performance. We examined the relationship between Abeta levels (Abeta40, Abeta42, or the ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40) and cognitive function as measured by escape latency times in the Morris water maze or exploratory preference percentage in the novel object recognition test. Our systematic review examined five mouse models (Tg2576, APP, PS1, 3xTg, APP(OSK)-Tg), gender, and age. The overall result revealed no statistically significant correlation between quantified Abeta levels and experimental measures of cognitive function. However, enough of the trends were of the same sign to suggest that there probably is a very weak qualitative trend visible only across many orders of magnitude. In summary, the results of the systematic review revealed that mice bred to show elevated levels of Abeta do not perform significantly worse in cognitive tests than mice that do not have elevated Abeta levels. Our results suggest two lines of inquiry: 1) Abeta is a biochemical "side effect" of the AD pathology; or 2) learning and memory deficits in AD are tied to the presence of qualitatively "high" levels of Abeta but are not quantitatively sensitive to the levels themselves.

Our results suggest two lines of inquiry: 1) Abeta is a biochemical "side effect" of the AD pathology; or 2) learning and memory deficits in AD are tied to the presence of qualitatively "high" levels of Abeta but are not quantitatively sensitive to the levels themselves.

AB  - Cognitive decline, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and accompanying neuropsychiatric symptoms share dysfunctions of synaptic processes as a common cellular pathomechanism. Long-term potentiation has proven to be a sensitive tool for the "diagnosis" of such synaptic dysfunctions. Much less, however, is known about how long-term depression (LTD), an alternative mechanism for the storage of memory, is affected by Alzheimer's disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that impaired late LTD (>3 hours) in THY-Tau22 mice can be rescued by either inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3beta) activity or by application of the protein-phosphatase 2A agonist selenate. In line with these findings, we observed increased phosphorylation of GSK3beta at Y216 and reduced total phosphatase activity in biochemical assays of hippocampal tissue of THY-Tau22 mice. Interestingly, LTD induction and pharmacologic inhibition of GSK3beta appeared to downregulate GSK3ss activity via a marked upregulation of phosphorylation at the inhibitory Ser9 residue. Our results point to alterations in phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation homeostasis as key mechanisms underlying the deficits in LTD and hippocampus-dependent learning found in THY-Tau22 mice.

AB  - GluN2B subunit containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs) mediate pathophysiological effects of acutely applied amyloid beta (Abeta), including impaired long-term potentiation (LTP). However, in transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models which feature gradual Abeta accumulation, the function of GluN2B-NMDARs and their contribution to synaptic plasticity are unknown. Therefore, we examined the role of GluN2B-NMDARs in synaptic function and plasticity in the hippocampus of PS2APP transgenic mice. Although LTP induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) was normal in PS2APP mice, it was significantly reduced by the selective GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist Ro25-6981 (Ro25) in PS2APP mice, but not wild type (wt) mice. While NMDARs activated by single synaptic stimuli were not blocked by Ro25, NMDARs recruited during burst stimulation showed larger blockade by Ro25 in PS2APP mice. Thus, the unusual dependence of LTP on GluN2B-NMDARs in PS2APP mice suggests that non-synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs are activated by glutamate that spills out of synaptic cleft during the burst stimulation used to induce LTP. While long-term depression (LTD) was normal in PS2APP mice, and Ro25 had no impact on LTD in wt mice, Ro25 impaired LTD in PS2APP mice, again demonstrating aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR function during plasticity. Together these results demonstrate altered GluN2B-NMDAR function in a model of early AD pathology that has implications for the therapeutic targeting of NMDARs in AD.

AB  - The question of how animal studies should be designed, conducted, and analyzed remains underexposed in societal debates on animal experimentation. This is not only a scientific but also a moral question. After all, if animal experiments are not appropriately designed, conducted, and analyzed, the results produced are unlikely to be reliable and the animals have in effect been wasted. In this article, we focus on one particular method to address this moral question, namely systematic reviews of previously performed animal experiments. We discuss how the design, conduct, and analysis of future (animal and human) experiments may be optimized through such systematic reviews. In particular, we illustrate how these reviews can help improve the methodological quality of animal experiments, make the choice of an animal model and the translation of animal data to the clinic more evidence-based, and implement the 3Rs. Moreover, we discuss which measures are being taken and which need to be taken in the future to ensure that systematic reviews will actually contribute to optimizing experimental design and thereby to meeting a necessary condition for making the use of animals in these experiments justified.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiased way for inclusion in systematic reviews both complex and time consuming. Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities. METHODS: Five research questions led our review: what is the state of the evidence base; how has workload reduction been evaluated; what are the purposes of semi-automation and how effective are they; how have key contextual problems of applying text mining to the systematic review field been addressed; and what challenges to implementation have emerged? We answered these questions using standard systematic review methods: systematic and exhaustive searching, quality-assured data extraction and a narrative synthesis to synthesise findings. RESULTS: The evidence base is active and diverse; there is almost no replication between studies or collaboration between research teams and, whilst it is difficult to establish any overall conclusions about best approaches, it is clear that efficiencies and reductions in workload are potentially achievable. On the whole, most suggested that a saving in workload of between 30% and 70% might be possible, though sometimes the saving in workload is accompanied by the loss of 5% of relevant studies (i.e. a 95% recall). CONCLUSIONS: Using text mining to prioritise the order in which items are screened should be considered safe and ready for use in 'live' reviews. The use of text mining as a 'second screener' may also be used cautiously. The use of text mining to eliminate studies automatically should be considered promising, but not yet fully proven. In highly technical/clinical areas, it may be used with a high degree of confidence; but more developmental and evaluative work is needed in other disciplines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiased way for inclusion in systematic reviews both complex and time consuming. Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities. METHODS: Five research questions led our review: what is the state of the evidence base; how has workload reduction been evaluated; what are the purposes of semi-automation and how effective are they; how have key contextual problems of applying text mining to the systematic review field been addressed; and what challenges to implementation have emerged? We answered these questions using standard systematic review methods: systematic and exhaustive searching, quality-assured data extraction and a narrative synthesis to synthesise findings. RESULTS: The evidence base is active and diverse; there is almost no replication between studies or collaboration between research teams and, whilst it is difficult to establish any overall conclusions about best approaches, it is clear that efficiencies and reductions in workload are potentially achievable. On the whole, most suggested that a saving in workload of between 30% and 70% might be possible, though sometimes the saving in workload is accompanied by the loss of 5% of relevant studies (i.e. a 95% recall). CONCLUSIONS: Using text mining to prioritise the order in which items are screened should be considered safe and ready for use in 'live' reviews. The use of text mining as a 'second screener' may also be used cautiously. The use of text mining to eliminate studies automatically should be considered promising, but not yet fully proven. In highly technical/clinical areas, it may be used with a high degree of confidence; but more developmental and evaluative work is needed in other disciplines.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging result in impaired ability to store memories, but the cellular mechanisms responsible for these defects are poorly understood. Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations are responsible for many early-onset familial AD (FAD) cases. The phenomenon of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely used in studies of memory formation and storage. Recent data revealed long-term LTP maintenance (L-LTP) is impaired in PS1-M146V knock-in (KI) FAD mice. To understand the basis for this phenomenon, in the present study we analyzed structural synaptic plasticity in hippocampal cultures from wild type (WT) and KI mice. We discovered that exposure to picrotoxin induces formation of mushroom spines in both WT and KI cultures, but the maintenance of mushroom spines is impaired in KI neurons. This maintenance defect can be explained by an abnormal firing pattern during the consolidation phase of structural plasticity in KI neurons. Reduced frequency of neuronal firing in KI neurons is caused by enhanced calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), enhanced activity of calcium-activated potassium channels, and increased afterhyperpolarization. As a result, "consolidation" pattern of neuronal activity converted to "depotentiation" pattern of neuronal activity in KI neurons. Consistent with this model, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibitors of CICR (dantrolene), of calcium-activated potassium channels (apamin), and of calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (FK506) are able to rescue structural plasticity defects in KI neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incubation with dantrolene or apamin also rescued L-LTP defects in KI hippocampal slices, suggesting a role for a similar mechanism. This proposed mechanism may be responsible for memory defects in AD but also for age-related memory decline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the methodological assessment tools for pre-clinical and clinical studies, systematic review and meta-analysis, and clinical practice guideline. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers Manual, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) up to May 20th, 2014. Two authors selected studies and extracted data; quantitative analysis was performed to summarize the characteristics of included tools. RESULTS: We included a total of 21 assessment tools for analysis. A number of tools were developed by academic organizations, and some were developed by only a small group of researchers. The JBI developed the highest number of methodological assessment tools, with CASP coming second. Tools for assessing the methodological quality of randomized controlled studies were most abundant. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias is the best available tool for assessing RCTs. For cohort and case-control studies, we recommend the use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) is an excellent tool for assessing non-randomized interventional studies, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (ARHQ) methodology checklist is applicable for cross-sectional studies. For diagnostic accuracy test studies, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool is recommended; the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool is available for assessing animal studies; Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) is a measurement tool for systematic reviews/meta-analyses; an 18-item tool has been developed for appraising case series studies, and the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE)-II instrument is widely used to evaluate clinical practice guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully identified a variety of methodological assessment tools for different types of study design. However, further efforts in the development of critical appraisal tools are warranted since there is currently a lack of such tools for other fields, e.g. genetic studies, and some existing tools (nested case-control studies and case reports, for example) are in need of updating to be in line with current research practice and rigor. In addition, it is very important that all critical appraisal tools remain subjective and performance bias is effectively avoided.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because the new era of preclinical stroke research demands improvements in validity and generalizability of findings, moving from single site to multicenter studies could be pivotal. However, the conduct of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in stroke remains ill-defined. We sought to assess the variability in the use of MRI for evaluating lesions post stroke and to examine the possibility as an alternative to gold standard histology for measuring the infarct size. METHODS: We identified animal studies of ischemic stroke reporting lesion sizes using MRI. We assessed the degree of heterogeneity and reporting of scanning protocols, postprocessing methods, study design characteristics, and study quality. Studies performing histological evaluation of infarct size were further selected to compare with corresponding MRI using meta-regression. RESULTS: Fifty-four articles undertaking a total of 78 different MRI scanning protocols met the inclusion criteria. T2-weighted imaging was most frequently used (83% of the studies), followed by diffusion-weighted imaging (43%). Reporting of the imaging parameters was adequate, but heterogeneity between studies was high. Twelve studies assessed the infarct size using both MRI and histology at corresponding time points, with T2-weighted imaging-based treatment effect having a significant positive correlation with histology (; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for standardized use and reporting of MRI in preclinical stroke are urgently needed. T2-weighted imaging could be used as an effective in vivo alternative to histology for estimating treatment effects based on the extent of infarction; however, additional studies are needed to explore the effect of individual parameters.

AB  - Animal models have proven to be invaluable to researchers trying to answer questions regarding the mechanisms of behavior. The Open Field Maze is one of the most commonly used platforms to measure behaviors in animal models. It is a fast and relatively easy test that provides a variety of behavioral information ranging from general ambulatory ability to data regarding the emotionality of the subject animal. As it relates to rodent models, the procedure allows the study of different strains of mice or rats both laboratory bred and wild-captured. The technique also readily lends itself to the investigation of different pharmacological compounds for anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects. Here, a protocol for use of the open field maze to describe mouse behaviors is detailed and a simple analysis of general locomotor ability and anxiety-related emotional behaviors between two strains of C57BL/6 mice is performed. Briefly, using the described protocol we show Wild Type mice exhibited significantly less anxiety related behaviors than did age-matched Knock Out mice while both strains exhibited similar ambulatory ability.

AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) has been shown to increase lifespan and delay aging phenotypes in many diverse eukaryotic species. In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CR has been shown to decrease amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau levels and preserve cognitive function. Overexpression of human mutant tau protein has been shown to induce deficits in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I activity. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine the effects of 4-month CR on brain mitochondrial function in Tg4510 mice, which express human P301L tau. Expression of mutant tau led to decreased ADP-stimulated respiratory rates, but not uncoupler-stimulated respiratory rates. The membrane potential was also slightly higher in mitochondria from the P301L tau mice. As shown previously, tau expression decreased mitochondrial complex I activity. The decreased complex I activity, decreased ADP-stimulated respiratory rate, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential occurring in mitochondria from Tg4510 mice were not restored by CR. However, the CR diet did result in a genotype independent decrease in mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase activity. This decrease in F0F1-ATPase activity was not due to lowered levels of the alpha or beta subunits of F0F1-ATPase. The possible mechanisms through which CR reduces the F0F1-ATPase activity in brain mitochondria are discussed.

Overexpression of human mutant tau protein has been shown to induce deficits in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I activity. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine the effects of 4-month CR on brain mitochondrial function in Tg4510 mice, which express human P301L tau. Expression of mutant tau led to decreased ADP-stimulated respiratory rates, but not uncoupler-stimulated respiratory rates. The membrane potential was also slightly higher in mitochondria from the P301L tau mice. As shown previously, tau expression decreased mitochondrial complex I activity. The decreased complex I activity, decreased ADP-stimulated respiratory rate, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential occurring in mitochondria from Tg4510 mice were not restored by CR. However, the CR diet did result in a genotype independent decrease in mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase activity. This decrease in F0F1-ATPase activity was not due to lowered levels of the alpha or beta subunits of F0F1-ATPase. The possible mechanisms through which CR reduces the F0F1-ATPase activity in brain mitochondria are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automation of the parts of systematic review process, specifically the data extraction step, may be an important strategy to reduce the time necessary to complete a systematic review. However, the state of the science of automatically extracting data elements from full texts has not been well described. This paper performs a systematic review of published and unpublished methods to automate data extraction for systematic reviews. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, IEEEXplore, and ACM Digital Library to identify potentially relevant articles. We included reports that met the following criteria: 1) methods or results section described what entities were or need to be extracted, and 2) at least one entity was automatically extracted with evaluation results that were presented for that entity. We also reviewed the citations from included reports. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1190 unique citations that met our search criteria, we found 26 published reports describing automatic extraction of at least one of more than 52 potential data elements used in systematic reviews. For 25 (48 %) of the data elements used in systematic reviews, there were attempts from various researchers to extract information automatically from the publication text. Out of these, 14 (27 %) data elements were completely extracted, but the highest number of data elements extracted automatically by a single study was 7. Most of the data elements were extracted with F-scores (a mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) of over 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: We found no unified information extraction framework tailored to the systematic review process, and published reports focused on a limited (1-7) number of data elements. Biomedical natural language processing techniques have not been fully utilized to fully or even partially automate the data extraction step of systematic reviews.

AB  - Observer bias and other "experimenter effects" occur when researchers' expectations influence study outcome. These biases are strongest when researchers expect a particular result, are measuring subjective variables, and have an incentive to produce data that confirm predictions. To minimize bias, it is good practice to work "blind," meaning that experimenters are unaware of the identity or treatment group of their subjects while conducting research. Here, using text mining and a literature review, we find evidence that blind protocols are uncommon in the life sciences and that nonblind studies tend to report higher effect sizes and more significant p-values. We discuss methods to minimize bias and urge researchers, editors, and peer reviewers to keep blind protocols in mind.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The public and healthcare workers have a high expectation of animal research which they perceive as necessary to predict the safety and efficacy of drugs before testing in clinical trials. However, the expectation is not always realised and there is evidence that the research often fails to stand up to scientific scrutiny and its 'predictive value' is either weak or absent. DISCUSSION: Problems with the use of animals as models of humans arise from a variety of biases and systemic failures including: 1) bias and poor practice in research methodology and data analysis; 2) lack of transparency in scientific assessment and regulation of the research; 3) long-term denial of weaknesses in cross-species translation; 4) profit-driven motives overriding patient interests; 5) lack of accountability of expenditure on animal research; 6) reductionist-materialism in science which tends to dictate scientific inquiry and control the direction of funding in biomedical research. Bias in animal research needs to be addressed before medical research and healthcare decision-making can be more evidence-based. Research funding may be misdirected on studying 'disease mechanisms' in animals that cannot be replicated outside tightly controlled laboratory conditions, and without sufficient critical evaluation animal research may divert attention away from avenues of research that hold promise for human health. The potential for harm to patients and trial volunteers from reliance on biased animal data(1) requires measures to improve its conduct, regulation and analysis. This article draws attention to a few of the many forms of bias in animal research that have come to light in the last decade and offers a strategy incorporating ten recommendations stated at the end of each section on bias. The proposals need development through open debate and subsequent rigorous implementation so that reviewers may determine the value of animal research to human health.

AB  - Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. It is thought that this risk is conferred by the presence of three copies of the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP)--an Alzheimer disease risk factor--although the possession of extra copies of other chromosome 21 genes may also play a part. Further study of the mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome could provide insights into the mechanisms that cause dementia in the general population.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Much of the molecular understanding of synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) comes from studies of various mouse models that express familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations, often in combinations. Most studies compare the absolute magnitudes of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) to assess deficits in bidirectional synaptic plasticity accompanying FAD-linked mutations. However, LTP and LTD are not static, but their induction threshold is adjusted by overall neural activity via metaplasticity. Hence LTP/LTD changes in AD mouse models may reflect defects in metaplasticity processes. To determine this, we examined the LTP/LTD induction threshold in APPswe;PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (Tg) mice across two different ages. We found that in young Tg mice (1 month), LTP is enhanced at the expense of LTD, but in adults (6 months), the phenotype is reversed to promote LTD and reduce LTP, compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. The apparent opposite phenotype across age was due to an initial offset in the induction threshold to favor LTP and the inability to undergo developmental metaplasticity in Tg mice. In WTs, the synaptic modification threshold decreased over development to favor LTP and diminish LTD in adults. However, in Tg mice, the magnitudes of LTP and LTD stayed constant across development. The initial offset in LTP/LTD threshold in young Tg mice did not accompany changes in the LTP/LTD induction mechanisms, but altered AMPA receptor phosphorylation and appearance of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. We propose that the main synaptic defect in AD mouse models is due to their inability to undergo developmental metaplasticity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work offers a new insight that metaplasticity defects are central to synaptic dysfunctions seen in AD mouse models. In particular, we demonstrate that the apparent differences in LTP/LTD magnitude seen across ages in AD transgenic mouse models reflect the inability to undergo a normal developmental shift in metaplasticity.

AB  - Preclinical studies are essential for translation to disease treatments and effective use in clinical practice. An undue emphasis on single approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to have retarded the pace of translation in the field, and there is much frustration in the public about the lack of an effective treatment. We critically reviewed past literature (1990-2014), analyzed numerous data, and discussed key issues at a consensus conference on Brain Ageing and Dementia to identify and overcome roadblocks in studies intended for translation. We highlight various factors that influence the translation of preclinical research and highlight specific preclinical strategies that have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. The field has been hindered by the domination of the amyloid hypothesis in AD pathogenesis while the causative pathways in disease pathology are widely considered to be multifactorial. Understanding the causative events and mechanisms in the pathogenesis are equally important for translation. Greater efforts are necessary to fill in the gaps and overcome a variety of confounds in the generation, study design, testing, and evaluation of animal models and the application to future novel anti-dementia drug trials. A greater variety of potential disease mechanisms must be entertained to enhance progress.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Aging is the most important risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular mechanisms linking aging to AD remain unclear. Suppression of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) increases healthspan and lifespan in several organisms, from nematodes to mammals. Here we show that S6K1 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD patients. Using a mouse model of AD, we found that genetic reduction of S6K1 improved synaptic plasticity and spatial memory deficits, and reduced the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau, the two neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Mechanistically, these changes were linked to reduced translation of tau and the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, a key enzyme in the generation of amyloid-beta. Our results implicate S6K1 dysregulation as a previously unidentified molecular mechanism underlying synaptic and memory deficits in AD. These findings further suggest that therapeutic manipulation of S6K1 could be a valid approach to mitigate AD pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Aging is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how it contributes to AD pathogenesis. S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is a protein kinase involved in regulation of protein translation. Reducing S6K1 activity increases lifespan and healthspan. We report the novel finding that reducing S6K1 activity in 3xTg-AD mice ameliorates synaptic and cognitive deficits. These improvement were associated with a reduction in amyloid-beta and tau pathology. Mechanistically, lowering S6K1 levels reduced translation of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 and tau, two key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis. These data suggest that S6K1 may represent a molecular link between aging and AD. Given that aging is the most important risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, our results may have far-reaching implications into other diseases.

AB  - In the attempt to elucidate if the "peripheral sink hypothesis" could be a potential mechanism of action for tau removal in passive immunotherapy experiments, we have examined tau levels in serum of chronically injected JNPL3 and Tg4510 transgenic animals. Measurement of tau in serum of mice treated with tau antibodies is challenging because of the antibody interference in sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. To address this issue, we have developed a heat-treatment protocol at acidic pH to remove interfering molecules from serum, with excellent recovery of tau. The present data show that pan-tau and conformational antibodies do increase tau in mouse sera. However, these concentrations in serum do not consistently correlate with reductions of tau pathology in brain, suggesting that large elevations of tau species measured in serum are not predictive of efficacy. Here, we describe a reliable method to detect tau in serum of transgenic animals that have undergone tau immunotherapy. Levels of tau in human serum are less than the sensitivity of current assays, although artifactual signals are common. The method may be useful in similarly treated humans, a situation in which false positive signals are likely.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare effectiveness of different options for de-duplicating records retrieved from systematic review searches. METHODS: Using the records from a published systematic review, five de-duplication options were compared. The time taken to de-duplicate in each option and the number of false positives (were deleted but should not have been) and false negatives (should have been deleted but were not) were recorded. RESULTS: The time for each option varied. The number of positive and false duplicates returned from each option also varied greatly. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend different de-duplication options based on the skill level of the searcher and the purpose of de-duplication efforts.

AB  - Microglia and astrocytes are the major source of cytokines in Alzheimer,s disease (AD). CX3CR1 is a delta chemokine receptor found in microglia and its neuronal ligand, Fractalkine, has two isoforms: an anchored-membrane isoform, and a soluble isoform. The reduced soluble fractalkine levels found in the brain (cortex/hippocampus) of aged rats, may be a consequence of neuronal loss. This soluble fractalkine maintains microglia in an appropiate state by interacting with CX3CR1. The ablation of the CX3CR1 gene in mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP/PS-1) increased cytokine levels, enhanced Tau pathology and worsened behavioural performance in these mice. However, CX3CR1 deficiency resulted in a gene dose-dependent Abeta clearance in the brain, and induced microglial activation. In addition, CX3CR1 deficiency can have benefical effects by preventing neuronal loss in the 3xTg model. In fact, CX3CR1 deficiency increases microglial phagocytosome activity by inducing selective protofibrillar amyloid-beta phagocytosis in microglial cells in transgenic AD models. On the other hand, the fractalkine membrane isoform plays a differential role in amyloid beta clearance and Tau deposition. This anchored membrane FKN signalling might increase amyloid pathology while soluble fractalkine levels could prevent taupathies. However, in human AD, the only published study has reported higher systemic fractalkine levels in AD patients with cognitive impairment. In mouse models, inflammatory activation of microglia accelerates Tau pathology. Studies in transgenic mice with fractalkine null mice suggest that APP/PS-1 mice deficient for the anchored membrane-fractalkine isoform exhibited enhanced neuronal MAPT phosphorylation despite their reduced amyloid burden. The soluble fractalkine overexpression with adenoviral vectors reduced tau pathology and prevented neurodegeneration in a Tg4510 model of taupathy Finally, animals with Abeta (1-42) infused by lentivirus (cortex) or mice with the P301L mutation (frontotemporal dementia) had caspase-3 activation (8-fold) and higher proinflammatory TNF alpha levels and p-Tau deposits at 4 weeks postinfusion. Thus, the CX3CR1/Fractalkine axis regulates microglial activation, the clearance of amyloid plaque and plays a role in p-Tau intraneuronal accumulation in rodent models of AD.

AB  - Synapses have been known for many years to be the crucial target of pathology in different forms of dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synapses and their appropriate activation or inhibition are fundamental for the proper brain function. Alterations in synaptic/neuronal activity and brain metabolism are considered among the earliest symptoms linked to the progression of AD, and lead to a central question in AD research: what is the role played by synaptic activity in AD pathogenesis? Intriguingly, in the last decade, important studies demonstrated that the state of activation of synapses affects the homeostasis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau, both of which aggregate and accumulate during AD, and are involved in neuronal dysfunction. In this review we aim to summarize the up-to-date data linking synaptic/neuronal activity with Abeta and tau; moreover, we also intend to provide a critical overview on brain activity alterations in AD, and their role in the disease's pathophysiology.

AB  - Development of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease correlates with neuronal loss and dementia. Transgenic Tg4510 mice model the tauopathy of the disease, with these mice exhibiting progressive, region-specific neuronal loss, and behavioral deficits. In the present study, neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of 7-month-old Tg4510 mice was investigated and compared with age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Multisite field potentials were recorded using 16-site silicon probes, inserted across the hippocampus in urethane anesthetized mice. The hippocampal network theta oscillation was evaluated in these mice by stimulating the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Subsequently, population spikes in the dentate gyrus were identified in response to perforant path stimulation, and long-term potentiation was elicited by theta burst stimulation. Tg4510 mice showed dramatically reduced dentate gyrus population spike amplitude; however, the magnitude of theta burst stimulation-induced long-term potentiation was identical in WT and transgenic mice. WT and Tg4510 mice showed identical increase in frequency to nucleus pontis oralis stimulation, whereas absolute theta power was severely reduced in the Tg4510 animals. Because total signal power over the entire frequency band range was reduced, there was no difference in relative theta power between WT and Tg4510 mice. These presently described electrophysiological findings can be directly attributed to the drastic reduction of pyramidal/granule neurons in Tg4510 mice, which could be the main contributing factor to their impaired behavior and cognitive function. However, the remaining synapses and neuronal circuitry seem to function properly in these assays.

AB  - The scientific community and decision-makers are increasingly concerned about transparency and reproducibility of epidemiologic studies using longitudinal healthcare databases. We explored the extent to which published pharmacoepidemiologic studies using commercially available databases could be reproduced by other investigators. We identified a nonsystematic sample of 38 descriptive or comparative safety/effectiveness cohort studies. Seven studies were excluded from reproduction, five because of violation of fundamental design principles, and two because of grossly inadequate reporting. In the remaining studies, >1,000 patient characteristics and measures of association were reproduced with a high degree of accuracy (median differences between original and reproduction <2% and <0.1). An essential component of transparent and reproducible research with healthcare databases is more complete reporting of study implementation. Once reproducibility is achieved, the conversation can be elevated to assess whether suboptimal design choices led to avoidable bias and whether findings are replicable in other data sources.

AB  - Those at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) often exhibit hippocampal hyperexcitability in the years preceding diagnosis. Our previous work with the rTg(TauP301L)4510 tau mouse model of AD suggests that this increase in hyperexcitability is likely mediated by an increase in depolarization-evoked glutamate release and a decrease in glutamate uptake, alterations of which correlate with learning and memory deficits. Treatment with riluzole restored glutamate regulation and rescued memory deficits in the TauP301L model. Here, we used enzyme-based ceramic microelectrode array technology to measure real-time phasic glutamate release and uptake events in the hippocampal subregions of TauP301L mice. For the first time, we demonstrate that perturbations in glutamate transients (rapid, spontaneous bursts of glutamate) exist in a tau mouse model of AD mouse model and that riluzole mitigates these alterations. These results help to inform our understanding of how glutamate signaling is altered in the disease process and also suggest that riluzole may serve as a clinically applicable therapeutic approach in AD.

AB  - Those at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) often exhibit hippocampal hyperexcitability in the years preceding diagnosis. Our previous work with the rTg(TauP301L)4510 tau mouse model of AD suggests that this increase in hyperexcitability is likely mediated by an increase in depolarization-evoked glutamate release and a decrease in glutamate uptake, alterations of which correlate with learning and memory deficits. Treatment with riluzole restored glutamate regulation and rescued memory deficits in the TauP301L model. Here, we used enzyme-based ceramic microelectrode array technology to measure real-time phasic glutamate release and uptake events in the hippocampal subregions of TauP301L mice. For the first time, we demonstrate that perturbations in glutamate transients (rapid, spontaneous bursts of glutamate) exist in a tau mouse model of AD mouse model and that riluzole mitigates these alterations. These results help to inform our understanding of how glutamate signaling is altered in the disease process and also suggest that riluzole may serve as a clinically applicable therapeutic approach in AD.

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau proteins are associated with different clinical progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We enrolled forty newly diagnosed AD patients, who underwent lumbar puncture, and carried out a K-means cluster analysis based on CSF biomarkers levels, resulting in two AD patient groups: Cluster 1 showed relatively high levels of Abeta and low levels of tau; Cluster 2 showed relatively low levels of Abeta and high levels of tau. Cortical plasticity was tested using the intermittent and continuous theta burst stimulation (iTBS and cTBS) protocols evoking respectively long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Cholinergic transmission was tested by the short-latency afferent inhibition protocol. Neurophysiological evaluation showed that the two AD groups differed in terms of cortical plasticity: after iTBS, Cluster 2 patients showed a remarkable reversal of LTP toward LTD that was not observed in Cluster 1. LTD and central cholinergic transmission did not differ between groups. Patients were assessed longitudinally with Mini-Mental State Examination at 6, 12, and 18 month follow-ups. Cluster 2 AD had a faster cognitive decline already evident at the 12 month follow-up. High tau CSF levels were associated with LTD-like cortical plasticity and faster clinical progression. These results suggest that more aggressive tau pathology is associated with prominent LTD-like mechanisms of cortical plasticity and faster cognitive decline.

AB  - EEG radiotelemetry plays an important role in the neurological characterization of transgenic mouse models of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases as well as epilepsies providing valuable insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and thereby facilitating the development of new translational approaches. We elaborate on the major advantages of nonrestraining EEG radiotelemetry in contrast to restraining procedures such as tethered systems or jacket systems containing recorders. Whereas a main disadvantage of the latter is their unphysiological, restraining character, telemetric EEG recording overcomes these disadvantages. It allows precise and highly sensitive measurement under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here we present a detailed description of a straightforward successful, quick, and efficient technique for intraperitoneal as well as subcutaneous pouch implantation of a standard radiofrequency transmitter in mice and rats. We further present computerized 3D-stereotaxic placement of both epidural and deep intracerebral electrodes. Preoperative preparation of mice and rats, suitable anaesthesia, and postoperative treatment and pain management are described in detail. A special focus is on fields of application, technical and experimental pitfalls, and technical connections of commercially available radiotelemetry systems with other electrophysiological setups.

AB  - For years, low reproducibility of preclinical trials and poor translation of promising preclinical therapies to the clinic have posed major challenges to translational research in most biomedical fields. To overcome the limitations that stand between experimental and clinical research, international consortia have attempted to establish standardized guidelines for study design and for reporting the resulting data. In addition, multicenter preclinical randomized controlled trials (pRCTs) have been proposed as a suitable tool for 'bridging the gap' between experimental research and clinical trials. We recently reported the design and results of the first such pRCT in which we confirmed the feasibility of using a coordinated approach with standardized protocols in collaboration with independent multinational research centers. However, despite its successes, this first pRCT also had several difficulties, particularly with respect to following the protocols established in the study design and analyzing the data. Here, we review our experiences performing the study, and we analyze and discuss the lessons learned from performing the first pRCT. Moreover, we provide suggestions regarding how obstacles can be overcome to improve the performance and outcome of future pRCT studies. Translational research is hampered by low reproducibility of preclinical studies and countless failed clinical trials. International consortia have proposed preclinical multicenter trials as an intermediate step to overcome this 'translational roadblock'. We have recently performed the first such preclinical randomized controlled trial (pRCT) by adopting key elements of clinical study design to preclinical research. In this review, we discuss the lessons learned from this trial and provide suggestions how to optimize future pRCTs. This article is part of the 60th Anniversary special issue.

AB  - Synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with cognitive decline. Involvement of microglia and complement in AD has been attributed to neuroinflammation, prominent late in disease. Here we show in mouse models that complement and microglia mediate synaptic loss early in AD. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade, is increased and associated with synapses before overt plaque deposition. Inhibition of C1q, C3, or the microglial complement receptor CR3 reduces the number of phagocytic microglia, as well as the extent of early synapse loss. C1q is necessary for the toxic effects of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers on synapses and hippocampal long-term potentiation. Finally, microglia in adult brains engulf synaptic material in a CR3-dependent process when exposed to soluble Aβ oligomers. Together, these findings suggest that the complement-dependent pathway and microglia that prune excess synapses in development are inappropriately activated and mediate synapse loss in AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A disease of unknown aetiology, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. As the elderly population grows worldwide, the number of patients with AD also increases rapidly. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of AD in Europe. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a literature search on Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete using the keywords <<Alzheimer>>, <<Alzheimer's disease>>, and <<AD>> combined with <<prevalence>>, <<incidence>>, and <<epidemiology>>. A Bayesian random effects model with 95% credible intervals was used. The I(2) statistic was applied to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Europe was estimated at 5.05% (95% CI, 4.73-5.39). The prevalence in men was 3.31% (95% CI, 2.85-3.80) and in women, 7.13% (95% CI, 6.56-7.72), and increased with age. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease in Europe was 11.08 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 10.30-11.89). Broken down by sex, it was 7.02 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 6.06-8.05) in men and 13.25 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 12.05-14.51) in women; again these rates increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our meta-analysis allow a better grasp of the impact of this disease in Europe.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered an age-related disorder. However, it is unclear whether AD induces the same pathological and neurophysiological modifications in synaptic functions independently from age of disease onset. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation tools to investigate the mechanisms of cortical plasticity and sensory-motor integration in AD patients with a wide range of disease onset. METHODS: We evaluated newly diagnosed sporadic AD (n = 54) in comparison with healthy age-matched controls (HS; n = 24). Cortical plasticity mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) or of long-term depression (LTD) were assessed using respectively intermittent (iTBS) or continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocols. Sensory-motor integration was evaluated by means of short afferent inhibition (SAI) protocol. RESULTS: AD patients show after iTBS an impairment of LTP-like cortical plasticity forming a paradoxical LTD in comparison to HS. LTD-like cortical plasticity is similar between AD and HS. LTP-like cortical plasticity is not associated with age, but AD patients presenting with more altered LTP-like cortical plasticity have more-severe cognitive decline at 18 months. SAI is impaired in AD and shows a strong association with the individual age of subjects rather than with disease age of onset. INTERPRETATION: Cortical LTP disruption is a central mechanism of AD that is independent from age of onset. AD can be described primarily as a disorder of LTP-like cortical plasticity not influenced by physiological aging and associated with a more-severe cognitive decline. Ann Neurol 2016;80:202-210.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered an age-related disorder. However, it is unclear whether AD induces the same pathological and neurophysiological modifications in synaptic functions independently from age of disease onset. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation tools to investigate the mechanisms of cortical plasticity and sensory-motor integration in AD patients with a wide range of disease onset. METHODS: We evaluated newly diagnosed sporadic AD (n = 54) in comparison with healthy age-matched controls (HS; n = 24). Cortical plasticity mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) or of long-term depression (LTD) were assessed using respectively intermittent (iTBS) or continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocols. Sensory-motor integration was evaluated by means of short afferent inhibition (SAI) protocol. RESULTS: AD patients show after iTBS an impairment of LTP-like cortical plasticity forming a paradoxical LTD in comparison to HS. LTD-like cortical plasticity is similar between AD and HS. LTP-like cortical plasticity is not associated with age, but AD patients presenting with more altered LTP-like cortical plasticity have more-severe cognitive decline at 18 months. SAI is impaired in AD and shows a strong association with the individual age of subjects rather than with disease age of onset. INTERPRETATION: Cortical LTP disruption is a central mechanism of AD that is independent from age of onset. AD can be described primarily as a disorder of LTP-like cortical plasticity not influenced by physiological aging and associated with a more-severe cognitive decline. Ann Neurol 2016;80:202-210.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity in the autoassociative network of recurrent connections among hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells is thought to enable the storage of episodic memory. Impaired episodic memory is an early manifestation of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD amyloidosis, we show that associative long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) is abolished in CA3 pyramidal cells at an early stage. This is caused by activation of upregulated neuronal adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) rather than by dysregulation of NMDAR signalling or altered dendritic spine morphology. Neutralization of A2AR by acute pharmacological inhibition, or downregulation driven by shRNA interference in a single postsynaptic neuron restore associative CA3 LTP. Accordingly, treatment with A2AR antagonists reverts one-trial memory deficits. These results provide mechanistic support to encourage testing the therapeutic efficacy of A2AR antagonists in early AD patients.

AB  - Weight loss and food intake disturbances that often precede cognitive decline and diagnosis have been extensively reported in Alzheimer's disease patients. Previously, we observed that transgenic mice overexpressing tau seemed to eat more food yet weigh less than nontransgenic littermates. Thus, the present longitudinal study measured the time course of changes in metabolic state over the lifespan of the tau depositing Tg4510 mouse model of tau deposition. Although body weight was comparable to nontransgenic littermates at 2 months of age, Tg4510 mice weighed less at older ages. This was accompanied by the accumulation of tau pathology and by dramatically increased activity in all phases of the 24-hour cycle. Resting metabolic rate was also increased at 7 months of age. At 12 months near the end of the Tg4510 lifespan, there was a wasting phase, with a considerable decrease of resting metabolic rate, although hyperactivity was maintained. These diverse changes in metabolism in a mouse model of tau deposition are discussed in the context of known changes in energy metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been developed to study the pathophysiology of amyloid β protein (Aβ) toxicity, which is thought to cause severe clinical symptoms such as memory impairment in AD patients. However, inconsistencies exist between studies using these animal models, specifically in terms of the effects on synaptic plasticity, a major cellular model of learning and memory. Whereas some studies find impairments in plasticity in these models, others do not. We show that long-term potentiation (LTP), in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from this mouse, is impared at Tg2576 adult 6-7 months old. However, LTP is inducible again in slices taken from Tg2576 aged 14-19 months old. In the aged Tg2576, we found that the percentage of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in hippocampal CA1-3 region is significantly decreased, and LTP inhibition or reversal mediated by NRG1/ErbB signaling, which requires ErbB4 receptors in PV interneurons, is impaired. Inhibition of ErbB receptor kinase in adult Tg2576 restores LTP but impairs depotentiation as shown in aged Tg2576. Our study suggests that hippocampal LTP reemerges in aged Tg2576. However, this reemerged LTP is an insuppressible form due to impaired NRG1/ErbB signaling, possibly through the loss of PV interneurons.

AB  - This report describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. It also examines in detail the financial impact of Alzheimer's on families, including annual costs to families and the difficult decisions families must often make to pay those costs. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from Alzheimer's disease, making it the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age >/= 65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 23%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which Alzheimer's disease contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease recorded on death certificates. In 2016, an estimated 700,000 Americans age >/= 65 years will die with Alzheimer's disease, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $221 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age >/= 65 years with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2016 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age >/= 65 years with dementia are estimated to be $236 billion. The costs of Alzheimer's care may place a substantial financial burden on families, who often have to take money out of their retirement savings, cut back on buying food, and reduce their own trips to the doctor. In addition, many family members incorrectly believe that Medicare pays for nursing home care and other types of long-term care. Such findings highlight the need for solutions to prevent dementia-related costs from jeopardizing the health and financial security of the families of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias.

AB  - The current state of the AD research field is highly dynamic is some respects, while seemingly stagnant in others. Regarding the former, our current lack of understanding of initiating disease mechanisms, the absence of effective treatment options, and the looming escalation of AD patients is energizing new research directions including a much-needed re-focusing on early pathogenic mechanisms, validating novel targets, and investigating relevant biomarkers, among other exciting new efforts to curb disease progression and foremost, preserve memory function. With regard to the latter, the recent disappointing series of failed Phase III clinical trials targeting Abeta and APP processing, in concert with poor association between brain Abeta levels and cognitive function, have led many to call for a re-evaluation of the primacy of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. In this review, we integrate new insights into one of the earliest described signaling abnormalities in AD pathogenesis, namely intracellular Ca(2+) signaling disruptions, and focus on its role in driving synaptic deficits - which is the feature that does correlate with AD-associated memory loss. Excess Ca(2+)release from intracellular stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been well-described in cellular and animal models of AD, as well as human patients, and here we expand upon recent developments in ER-localized release channels such as the IP3R and RyR, and the recent emphasis on RyR2. Consistent with ER Ca(2+) mishandling in AD are recent findings implicating aspects of SOCE, such as STIM2 function, and TRPC3 and TRPC6 levels. Other Ca(2+)-regulated organelles important in signaling and protein handling are brought into the discussion, with new perspectives on lysosomal regulation. These early signaling abnormalities are discussed in the context of synaptic pathophysiology and disruptions in synaptic plasticity with a particular emphasis on short-term plasticity deficits. Overall, we aim to update and expand the list of early neuronal signaling abnormalities implicated in AD pathogenesis, identify specific channels and organelles involved, and link these to proximal synaptic impairments driving the memory loss in AD. This is all within the broader goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets to preserve cognitive function in AD.

AB  - Animal experiments that are conducted worldwide contribute to significant findings and breakthroughs in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of various diseases, bringing up appropriate clinical interventions. However, their predictive value is often low, leading to translational failure. Problems like translational failure of animal studies and poorly designed animal experiments lead to loss of animal lives and less translatable data which affect research outcomes ethically and economically. Due to increasing complexities in animal usage with changes in public perception and stringent guidelines, it is becoming difficult to use animals for conducting studies. This review deals with challenges like poor experimental design and ethical concerns and discusses key concepts like sample size, statistics in experimental design, humane endpoints, economic assessment, species difference, housing conditions, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are often neglected. If practiced, these strategies can refine the procedures effectively and help translate the outcomes efficiently.

AB  - Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations. To this end, we propose a novel method - supervised distant supervision (SDS) - that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS. We show that this approach tends to outperform existing methods with respect to automated PICO extraction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate; LMTM), a stable reduced form of the methylthioninium moiety, acts as a selective inhibitor of tau protein aggregation both in vitro and in transgenic mouse models. Methylthioninium chloride has previously shown potential efficacy as monotherapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to determine whether LMTM was safe and effective in modifying disease progression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We did a 15-month, randomised, controlled double-blind, parallel-group trial at 115 academic centres and private research clinics in 16 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Russia with patients younger than 90 years with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Patients concomitantly using other medicines for Alzheimer's disease were permitted to be included because we considered it infeasible not to allow their inclusion; however, patients using medicines carrying warnings of methaemoglobinaemia were excluded because the oxidised form of methylthioninium in high doses has been shown to induce this condition. We randomly assigned participants (3:3:4) to 75 mg LMTM twice a day, 125 mg LMTM twice a day, or control (4 mg LMTM twice a day to maintain blinding with respect to urine or faecal discolouration) administered as oral tablets. We did the randomisation with an interactive web response system using 600 blocks of length ten, and stratified patients by severity of disease, global region, whether they were concomitantly using Alzheimer's disease-labelled medications, and site PET capability. Participants, their study partners (generally carers), and all assessors were masked to treatment assignment throughout the study. The coprimary outcomes were progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) scales from baseline assessed at week 65 in the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01689246) and the European Union Clinical Trials Registry (2012-002866-11). FINDINGS: Between Jan 29, 2013, and June 26, 2014, we recruited and randomly assigned 891 participants to treatment (357 to control, 268 to 75 mg LMTM twice a day, and 266 to 125 mg LMTM twice a day). The prespecified primary analyses did not show any treatment benefit at either of the doses tested for the coprimary outcomes (change in ADAS-Cog score compared with control [n=354, 6·32, 95% CI 5·31-7·34]: 75 mg LMTM twice a day [n=257] -0·02, -1·60 to 1·56, p=0·9834, 125 mg LMTM twice a day [n=250] -0·43, -2·06 to 1·20, p=0·9323; change in ADCS-ADL score compared with control [-8·22, 95% CI -9·63 to -6·82]: 75 mg LMTM twice a day -0·93, -3·12 to 1·26, p=0·8659; 125 mg LMTM twice a day -0·34, -2·61 to 1·93, p=0·9479). Gastrointestinal and urinary effects were the most common adverse events with both high doses of LMTM, and the most common causes for discontinuation. Non-clinically significant dose-dependent reductions in haemoglobin concentrations were the most common laboratory abnormality. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities were noted in less than 1% (8/885) of participants. INTERPRETATION: The primary analysis for this study was negative, and the results do not suggest benefit of LMTM as an add-on treatment for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Findings from a recently completed 18-month trial of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease will be reported soon. FUNDING: TauRx Therapeutics.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates high risk of bias in preclinical animal research, questioning the scientific validity and reproducibility of published research findings. Systematic reviews found low rates of reporting of measures against risks of bias in the published literature (e.g., randomization, blinding, sample size calculation) and a correlation between low reporting rates and inflated treatment effects. That most animal research undergoes peer review or ethical review would offer the possibility to detect risks of bias at an earlier stage, before the research has been conducted. For example, in Switzerland, animal experiments are licensed based on a detailed description of the study protocol and a harm-benefit analysis. We therefore screened applications for animal experiments submitted to Swiss authorities (n = 1,277) for the rates at which the use of seven basic measures against bias (allocation concealment, blinding, randomization, sample size calculation, inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary outcome variable, and statistical analysis plan) were described and compared them with the reporting rates of the same measures in a representative sub-sample of publications (n = 50) resulting from studies described in these applications. Measures against bias were described at very low rates, ranging on average from 2.4% for statistical analysis plan to 19% for primary outcome variable in applications for animal experiments, and from 0.0% for sample size calculation to 34% for statistical analysis plan in publications from these experiments. Calculating an internal validity score (IVS) based on the proportion of the seven measures against bias, we found a weak positive correlation between the IVS of applications and that of publications (Spearman's rho = 0.34, p = 0.014), indicating that the rates of description of these measures in applications partly predict their rates of reporting in publications. These results indicate that the authorities licensing animal experiments are lacking important information about experimental conduct that determines the scientific validity of the findings, which may be critical for the weight attributed to the benefit of the research in the harm-benefit analysis. Similar to manuscripts getting accepted for publication despite poor reporting of measures against bias, applications for animal experiments may often be approved based on implicit confidence rather than explicit evidence of scientific rigor. Our findings shed serious doubt on the current authorization procedure for animal experiments, as well as the peer-review process for scientific publications, which in the long run may undermine the credibility of research. Developing existing authorization procedures that are already in place in many countries towards a preregistration system for animal research is one promising way to reform the system. This would not only benefit the scientific validity of findings from animal experiments but also help to avoid unnecessary harm to animals for inconclusive research.

AB  - Neuroplasticity is not only shaped by learning and memory but is also a mediator of responses to neuron attrition and injury (compensatory plasticity). As an ongoing process it reacts to neuronal cell activity and injury, death, and genesis, which encompasses the modulation of structural and functional processes of axons, dendrites, and synapses. The range of structural elements that comprise plasticity includes long-term potentiation (a cellular correlate of learning and memory), synaptic efficacy and remodelling, synaptogenesis, axonal sprouting and dendritic remodelling, and neurogenesis and recruitment. Degenerative diseases of the human brain continue to pose one of biomedicine's most intractable problems. Research on human neurodegeneration is now moving from descriptive to mechanistic analyses. At the same time, it is increasing apparently that morphological lesions traditionally used by neuropathologists to confirm post-mortem clinical diagnosis might furnish us with an experimentally tractable handle to understand causative pathways. Consider the aging-dependent neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is characterised at the neuropathological level by deposits of insoluble amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in extracellular plaques and aggregated tau protein, which is found largely in the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. We now appreciate that mild cognitive impairment in early AD may be due to synaptic dysfunction caused by accumulation of non-fibrillar, oligomeric Abeta, occurring well in advance of evident widespread synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. Soluble Abeta oligomers can adversely affect synaptic structure and plasticity at extremely low concentrations, although the molecular substrates by which synaptic memory mechanisms are disrupted remain to be fully elucidated. The dendritic spine constitutes a primary locus of excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. These structures protruding from dendritic shafts undergo dynamic changes in number, size and shape in response to variations in hormonal status, developmental stage, and changes in afferent input. It is perhaps not unexpected that loss of spine density may be linked to cognitive and memory impairment in AD, although the underlying mechanism(s) remain uncertain. This article aims to present a critical overview of current knowledge on the bases of synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on AD, and will cover amyloid- and nonamyloid- driven mechanisms. We will consider also emerging data dealing with potential therapeutic approaches for ameliorating the cognitive and memory deficits associated with these disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of reproducibility of preclinical studies has been identified as an impediment for translation of basic mechanistic research into effective clinical therapies. Indeed, the National Institutes of Health has revised its grant application process to require more rigorous study design, including sample size calculations, blinding procedures, and randomization steps. We hypothesized that the reporting of such metrics of study design rigor has increased over time for animal-experimental research published in anesthesia journals. METHODS: PubMed was searched for animal-experimental studies published in 2005, 2010, and 2015 in primarily English-language anesthesia journals. A total of 1466 publications were graded on the performance of sample size estimation, randomization, and blinding. Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess linear trends over time for the primary outcome of whether or not a metric was reported. Interrater agreement for each of the 3 metrics (power, randomization, and blinding) was assessed using the weighted kappa coefficient in a 10% random sample of articles rerated by a second investigator blinded to the ratings of the first investigator. RESULTS: A total of 1466 manuscripts were analyzed. Reporting for all 3 metrics of experimental design rigor increased over time (2005 to 2010 to 2015): for power analysis, from 5% (27/516), to 12% (59/485), to 17% (77/465); for randomization, from 41% (213/516), to 50% (243/485), to 54% (253/465); and for blinding, from 26% (135/516), to 38% (186/485), to 47% (217/465). The weighted kappa coefficients and 98.3% confidence interval indicate almost perfect agreement between the 2 raters beyond that which occurs by chance alone (power, 0.93 [0.85, 1.0], randomization, 0.91 [0.85, 0.98], and blinding, 0.90 [0.84, 0.96]). CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis that reported metrics of rigor in animal-experimental studies in anesthesia journals have increased during the past decade was confirmed. More consistent reporting, or explicit justification for absence, of sample size calculations, blinding techniques, and randomization procedures could better enable readers to evaluate potential sources of bias in animal-experimental research manuscripts. Future studies should assess whether such steps lead to improved translation of animal-experimental anesthesia research into successful clinical trials.

AB  - RATIONALE: Methodological sources of bias and suboptimal reporting contribute to irreproducibility in preclinical science and may negatively affect research translation. Randomization, blinding, sample size estimation, and considering sex as a biological variable are deemed crucial study design elements to maximize the quality and predictive value of preclinical experiments. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and temporal patterns of recommended study design element implementation in preclinical cardiovascular research. METHODS AND RESULTS: All articles published over a 10-year period in 5 leading cardiovascular journals were reviewed. Reports of in vivo experiments in nonhuman mammals describing pathophysiology, genetics, or therapeutic interventions relevant to specific cardiovascular disorders were identified. Data on study design and animal model use were collected. Citations at 60 months were additionally examined as a surrogate measure of research impact in a prespecified subset of studies, stratified by individual and cumulative study design elements. Of 28 636 articles screened, 3396 met inclusion criteria. Randomization was reported in 21.8%, blinding in 32.7%, and sample size estimation in 2.3%. Temporal and disease-specific analyses show that the implementation of these study design elements has overall not appreciably increased over the past decade, except in preclinical stroke research, which has uniquely demonstrated significant improvements in methodological rigor. In a subset of 1681 preclinical studies, randomization, blinding, sample size estimation, and inclusion of both sexes were not associated with increased citations at 60 months. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological shortcomings are prevalent in preclinical cardiovascular research, have not substantially improved over the past 10 years, and may be overlooked when basing subsequent studies. Resultant risks of bias and threats to study validity have the potential to hinder progress in cardiovascular medicine as preclinical research often precedes and informs clinical trials. Stroke research quality has uniquely improved in recent years, warranting a closer examination for interventions to model in other cardiovascular fields.

AB  - Disruption of normal circadian rhythm physiology is associated with neurodegenerative disease, which can lead to symptoms such as altered sleep cycles. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian dysfunction has been attributed to beta-amyloidosis. However, it is unclear whether tauopathy, another AD-associated neuropathology, can disrupt the circadian clock. We have evaluated the status of the circadian clock in a mouse model of tauopathy (Tg4510). Tg4510 mice display a long free-running period at an age when tauopathy is present, and show evidence of tauopathy in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus - the site of the master circadian clock. Additionally, cyclic expression of the core clock protein PER2 is disrupted in the hypothalamus of Tg4510 mice. Finally, disruption of the cyclic expression of PER2 and BMAL1, another core circadian clock protein, is evident in the Tg4510 hippocampus. These results demonstrate that tauopathy disrupts normal circadian clock function both at the behavioral and molecular levels, which may be attributed to the tauopathy-induced neuropathology in the SCN. Furthermore, these results establish the Tg4510 mouse line as a model to study how tauopathy disrupts normal circadian rhythm biology.

AB  - A challenge in working with preclinical models of neurodegeneration has been how to non-invasively monitor disease progression. Neurofilament proteins are established axonal damage markers and have been found to be elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood from patients with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and tauopathies. We hypothesized that CSF neurofilament light (NF-L) can be used to track progression of neurodegeneration and potentially monitor the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in preclinical development. To substantiate this, we examined whether changes in NF-L levels in brain, plasma, and CSF reflect the changing disease status of preclinical models of neurodegeneration. Using Western Blot and ELISA we characterized NF-L and disease-related proteins in brain, CSF and plasma samples from Tg4510 mice (tauopathy/AD), MitoPark mice (PD), and their age-matched control littermates. We found that CSF NF-L clearly discriminates Tg4510 from control littermates, which was not observed for the MitoPark model. However, both Tg4510 and MitoPark showed altered expression and solubilization of NFs compared to control littermates. We found a significant correlation between CSF NF-L and plasma NF-L in Tg4510, suggesting a similar biomarker potential of plasma NF-L. Also, CSF NF-L correlated significantly with tau in Tg4510 brains, suggesting a surrogate biomarker potential of CSF NF-L. Overall, our findings provide further evidence that NF-L correlates with disease severity and our results suggests, that CSF NF-L has utility as a surrogate or adjunct biomarker for neurodegeneration in the Tg4510 model, but independent validation is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Finding ways to reverse or prevent the consequences of pathogenic tau in the brain is of considerable importance for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Immunotherapy against tau has shown promise in several mouse models. In particular, an antibody with selectivity for oligomeric forms of tau, tau oligomer monoclonal antibody (TOMA), has shown rescue of the behavioral phenotype in several murine models of tau deposition. METHODS: In this study, we examined the capacity of TOMA to rescue the behavioral, histological, and neurochemical consequences of tau deposition in the aggressive Tg4510 model. We treated mice biweekly with 60 mug TOMA i.p. from 3.5 to 8 months of age. RESULTS: Near the end of the treatment, we found that oligomeric tau was elevated in both the CSF and in plasma. Further, we could detect mouse IgG in Tg4510 mouse brain after TOMA treatment, but not after injection with mouse IgG1 as control. However, we did not find significant reductions in behavioral deficits or tau deposits by either histological or biochemical measurements. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there is some exposure of the Tg4510 mouse brain to TOMA, but it was inadequate to affect the phenotype in these mice at the doses used. These data are consistent with other observations that the rapidly depositing Tg4510 mouse is a challenging model in which to demonstrate efficacy of tau-lowering treatments compared to some other preclinical models of tau deposition/overexpression.

AB  - The biologic processes underlying epileptogenesis following a brain insult are not fully understood, but several lines of evidence suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be an important factor in these processes. To provide further insight into the causal relationship between tau and epileptogenesis, this study applied amygdala kindling to rTg4510 mice that, concurrent with other pathologies, overexpress phosphorylated tau, tau knockout mice, or their respective wild-type controls. Mice were electrically stimulated twice daily, 5 days per week for 3 weeks. Electroencephalography was recorded to measure the primary afterdischarge duration, and the behavioral progression of kindling-induced seizures was assessed. rTg4510 mice (n = 10) had increased primary afterdischarge durations (p < 0.001), and significantly more rapid progression of kindling (p < 0.001), compared with wild-type mice (n = 10). Tau knockout mice (n = 7), however, did not differ from their wild-type counterparts (n = 8) on any of the seizure outcomes. These results suggest that Tg4510 mice are more vulnerable to epileptogenesis, but that the presence of tau itself is not necessary for kindling epileptogenesis to occur.

AB  - Data extraction is one of the most time-consuming tasks in performing a systematic review. Extraction is often onto some sort of form. Sharing completed forms can be used to check quality and accuracy of extraction or for re-cycling data to other researchers for updating. However, validating each piece of extracted data is time-consuming and linking to source problematic.In this methodology paper, we summarize three methods for reporting the location of data in original full-text reports, comparing their advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - Our understanding of the underlying biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been steadily progressing; however, this is yet to translate into a successful treatment in humans. The use of transgenic mouse models has helped to develop our understanding of AD, not only in terms of disease pathology, but also with the associated cognitive impairments typical of AD. Plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are often among the last pathological changes in AD mouse models, after neuronal loss and gliosis. There is a general consensus that successful treatments need to be applied before the onset of these pathologies and associated cognitive symptoms. This review discusses the different types of AD mouse models in terms of the temporal progression of the disease, how well they replicate the pathological changes seen in human AD and their cognitive defects. We provide a critical assessment of the behavioural tests used with AD mice to assess cognitive changes and decline, and discuss how successfully they correlate with cognitive impairments in humans with AD. This information is an important tool for AD researchers when deciding on appropriate mouse models, and when selecting measures to assess behavioural and cognitive change.

AB  - A living systematic review (LSR) should keep the review current as new research evidence emerges. Any meta-analyses included in the review will also need updating as new material is identified. If the aim of the review is solely to present the best current evidence standard meta-analysis may be sufficient, provided reviewers are aware that results may change at later updates. If the review is used in a decision-making context, more caution may be needed. When using standard meta-analysis methods, the chance of incorrectly concluding that any updated meta-analysis is statistically significant when there is no effect (the type I error) increases rapidly as more updates are performed. Inaccurate estimation of any heterogeneity across studies may also lead to inappropriate conclusions. This paper considers four methods to avoid some of these statistical problems when updating meta-analyses: two methods, that is, law of the iterated logarithm and the Shuster method control primarily for inflation of type I error and two other methods, that is, trial sequential analysis and sequential meta-analysis control for type I and II errors (failing to detect a genuine effect) and take account of heterogeneity. This paper compares the methods and considers how they could be applied to LSRs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We audited a selection of systematic reviews published in 2013 and reported on the proportion of reviews that researched for unpublished data, included unpublished data in analysis and assessed for publication bias. DESIGN: Audit of systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013 for the following journals: Journal of the American Medical Association, The British Medical Journal, Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We also searched the Cochrane Library and included 100 randomly selected Cochrane reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews published in 2013 in the selected journals were included. Methodological reviews were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently reviewed each included systematic review. The following data were extracted: whether the review searched for grey literature or unpublished data, the sources searched, whether unpublished data were included in analysis, whether publication bias was assessed and whether there was evidence of publication bias. MAIN FINDINGS: 203 reviews were included for analysis. 36% (73/203) of studies did not describe any attempt to obtain unpublished studies or to search grey literature. 89% (116/130) of studies that sought unpublished data found them. 33% (68/203) of studies included an assessment of publication bias, and 40% (27/68) of these found evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: A significant fraction of systematic reviews included in our study did not search for unpublished data. Publication bias may be present in almost half the published systematic reviews that assessed for it. Exclusion of unpublished data may lead to biased estimates of efficacy or safety in systematic reviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Findings from in vivo research may be less reliable where studies do not report measures to reduce risks of bias. The experimental stroke community has been at the forefront of implementing changes to improve reporting, but it is not known whether these efforts are associated with continuous improvements. Our aims here were firstly to validate an automated tool to assess risks of bias in published works, and secondly to assess the reporting of measures taken to reduce the risk of bias within recent literature for two experimental models of stroke. METHODS: We developed and used text analytic approaches to automatically ascertain reporting of measures to reduce risk of bias from full-text articles describing animal experiments inducing middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or modelling lacunar stroke. RESULTS: Compared with previous assessments, there were improvements in the reporting of measures taken to reduce risks of bias in the MCAO literature but not in the lacunar stroke literature. Accuracy of automated annotation of risk of bias in the MCAO literature was 86% (randomization), 94% (blinding) and 100% (sample size calculation); and in the lacunar stroke literature accuracy was 67% (randomization), 91% (blinding) and 96% (sample size calculation). DISCUSSION: There remains substantial opportunity for improvement in the reporting of animal research modelling stroke, particularly in the lacunar stroke literature. Further, automated tools perform sufficiently well to identify whether studies report blinded assessment of outcome, but improvements are required in the tools to ascertain whether randomization and a sample size calculation were reported.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Translational science supports successful transition of early biomedical research into human applications. In 2009 a translatability score to assess risk and identify strengths and weaknesses of a given project has been designed and successfully tested in case studies. The score elements, in particular the contributing weight factors, are heterogeneous for different disease areas; therefore, the score was individualized for six areas (cardiovascular, oncology, psychiatric, anti-viral, anti-bacterial/fungal and monogenetic diseases). RESULTS: FDA reviews and related literature were used for modifications of the score with emphasis on biomarkers, personalized medicine and animal models. 113 new medical entities approved by FDA from 2012 through 2016 were evaluated and metrics obtained for companion diagnostics and animal models as starting points for author-based individualization of the score. Most drugs approved in this period were related to oncology (46%), while the approvals were lowest for psychiatrics (4%). The evaluation of the FDA package inserts revealed that companion diagnostics play an important role in every field except psychiatrics. Further the analysis of the FDA reviews showed the weakness of animal models in psychiatrics and anti-virals, while useful animal models were present for all other fields. Consequently the scoring system was adapted to the different fields, resulting in increased weights for animal models, biomarker and personalized medicine in oncology. For psychiatrics the weights for animal models, biomarker and personalized medicine were decreased, while the weight for model compounds, clinical trials and surrogate or endpoint strategy were increased. For anti-viral drugs weights for in vitro data and personalized medicine were increased, while the weight for animal models was decreased. Further, for anti-bacterial/fungal drugs weights for animal models and personalized medicine were increased. Weights were increased for genetics and personalized medicine and decreased for model compounds for monogenetic orphans. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation of the score to different disease areas should help to support a structured and diverse approach to translation and encourage researchers in the private or public sectors to further customize the score.

AB  - Current antiseizure therapy is ineffective in approximately one third of people with epilepsy and is often associated with substantial side effects. In addition, most current therapeutic paradigms offer treatment, but not cure, and no therapies are able to modify the underlying disease, that is, can prevent or halt the process of epileptogenesis or alleviate the cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. Preclinical research in the field of epilepsy has been extensive, but unfortunately, not all the animal models being used have been validated for their predictive value. The overall goal of TASK2 of the AES/ILAE Translational Task Force is to organize and coordinate systematic reviews on selected topics regarding animal research in epilepsy. Herein we describe our strategy. In the first part of the paper we provide an overview of the usefulness of systematic reviews and meta-analysis for preclinical research and explain the essentials for their conduct. Then we describe in detail the protocol for a first systematic review, which will focus on the identification and characterization of outcome measures reported in animal models of epilepsy. The specific goals of this study are to define systematically the phenotypic characteristics of the most commonly used animal models, and to effectively compare these with the manifestations of human epilepsy. This will provide epilepsy researchers with detailed information on the strengths and weaknesses of epilepsy models, facilitating their refinement and future research. Ultimately, this could lead to a refined use of relevant models for understanding the mechanism(s) of the epilepsies and developing novel therapies.

AB  - In vivo electrophysiological recordings are widely used in neuroscience research, and video-electroencephalography (vEEG) has become a mainstay of preclinical neuroscience research, including studies of epilepsy and cognition. Studies utilizing vEEG typically involve comparison of measurements obtained from different experimental groups, or from the same experimental group at different times, in which one set of measurements serves as "control" and the others as "test" of the variables of interest. Thus, controls provide mainly a reference measurement for the experimental test. Control rodents represent an undiagnosed population, and cannot be assumed to be "normal" in the sense of being "healthy." Certain physiological EEG patterns seen in humans are also seen in control rodents. However, interpretation of rodent vEEG studies relies on documented differences in frequency, morphology, type, location, behavioral state dependence, reactivity, and functional or structural correlates of specific EEG patterns and features between control and test groups. This paper will focus on the vEEG of standard laboratory rodent strains with the aim of developing a small set of practical guidelines that can assist researchers in the design, reporting, and interpretation of future vEEG studies. To this end, we will: (1) discuss advantages and pitfalls of common vEEG techniques in rodents and propose a set of recommended practices and (2) present EEG patterns and associated behaviors recorded from adult rats of a variety of strains. We will describe the defining features of selected vEEG patterns (brain-generated or artifactual) and note similarities to vEEG patterns seen in adult humans. We will note similarities to normal variants or pathological human EEG patterns and defer their interpretation to a future report focusing on rodent seizure patterns.

AB  - In vitro preparations are a powerful tool to explore the mechanisms and processes underlying epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. In this review, we critically review the numerous in vitro methodologies utilized in epilepsy research. We provide support for the inclusion of detailed descriptions of techniques, including often ignored parameters with unpredictable yet significant effects on study reproducibility and outcomes. In addition, we explore how recent developments in brain slice preparation relate to their use as models of epileptic activity.

AB  - Genetically modified mice have provided insights into the progression and pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we have examined two mouse models of AD: the rTg4510 mouse, which overexpresses mutant human Tau gene, and the APP/PS1 mouse, which overexpresses mutant human genes for amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1. Both models exhibit deficits in hippocampal function, but comparative analyses of these deficits are sparse. We used extracellular field potential recordings in hippocampal slices to study basal synaptic transmission (BST), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in both models. We found that 6-7, but not 2-3-month-old rTg4510 mice exhibited reduced pre-synaptic activation (fiber volley (FV) amplitude, approximately 50%) and field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope ( approximately 40%) compared to wild-type controls. In contrast to previous reports, BST, when controlled for FV amplitude, was not altered in rTg4510. APP/PS1 mice (2-3 mo and 8-10 mo) had unchanged FV amplitude compared to wild-type controls, while fEPSP slope was reduced by approximately 34% in older mice, indicating a deficit in BST. PPF was unchanged in 8-10-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but was reduced in 6-7-month-old rTg4510 mice. LTP was reduced only in older rTg4510 and APP/PS1 mice. Our data suggest that BST deficits appear earlier in APP/PS1 than in rTg4510, which exhibited no BST deficits at the ages tested. However, FV and synaptic plasticity deficits developed earlier in rTg4510. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the progression of synaptic pathology in two genetically distinct models of AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Citation screening for scoping searches and rapid review is time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring days or sometimes months to complete. We examined the reliability of PICo-based title-only screening using keyword searches based on the PICo elements-Participants, Interventions, and Comparators, but not the Outcomes. METHODS: A convenience sample of 10 datasets, derived from the literature searches of completed systematic reviews, was used to test PICo-based title-only screening. Search terms for screening were generated from the inclusion criteria of each review, specifically the PICo elements-Participants, Interventions and Comparators. Synonyms for the PICo terms were sought, including alternatives for clinical conditions, trade names of generic drugs and abbreviations for clinical conditions, interventions and comparators. The MeSH database, Wikipedia, Google searches and online thesauri were used to assist generating terms. Title-only screening was performed by five reviewers independently in Endnote X7 reference management software using OR Boolean operator. Outcome measures were recall of included studies and the reduction in screening effort. Recall is the proportion of included studies retrieved using PICo title-only screening out of the total number of included studies in the original reviews. The percentage reduction in screening effort is the proportion of records not needing screening because the method eliminates them from the screen set. RESULTS: Across the 10 reviews, the reduction in screening effort ranged from 11 to 78% with a median reduction of 53%. In nine systematic reviews, the recall of included studies was 100%. In one review (oxygen therapy), four of five reviewers missed the same included study (median recall 67%). A post hoc analysis was performed on the dataset with the lowest reduction in screening effort (11%), and it was rescreened using only the intervention and comparator keywords and omitting keywords for participants. The reduction in screening effort increased to 57%, and the recall of included studies was maintained (100%). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of datasets, PICo-based title-only screening was able to expedite citation screening for scoping searches and rapid reviews by reducing the number of citations needed to screen but requires a thorough workup of the potential synonyms and alternative terms. Further research which evaluates the feasibility of this technique with heterogeneous datasets in different fields would be useful to inform the generalisability of this technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have been considered as the pillar on which evidence-based healthcare rests. Systematic review methodology has evolved and been modified over the years to accommodate the range of questions that may arise in the health and medical sciences. This paper explores a concept still rarely considered by novice authors and in the literature: determining the type of systematic review to undertake based on a research question or priority. RESULTS: Within the framework of the evidence-based healthcare paradigm, defining the question and type of systematic review to conduct is a pivotal first step that will guide the rest of the process and has the potential to impact on other aspects of the evidence-based healthcare cycle (evidence generation, transfer and implementation). It is something that novice reviewers (and others not familiar with the range of review types available) need to take account of but frequently overlook. Our aim is to provide a typology of review types and describe key elements that need to be addressed during question development for each type. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper a typology is proposed of various systematic review methodologies. The review types are defined and situated with regard to establishing corresponding questions and inclusion criteria. The ultimate objective is to provide clarified guidance for both novice and experienced reviewers and a unified typology with respect to review types.

AB  - Laboratory animal studies are used in a wide range of human health related research areas, such as basic biomedical research, drug research, experimental surgery and environmental health. The results of these studies can be used to inform decisions regarding clinical research in humans, for example the decision to proceed to clinical trials. If the research question relates to potential harms with no expectation of benefit (e.g., toxicology), studies in experimental animals may provide the only relevant or controlled data and directly inform clinical management decisions. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are important tools to provide robust and informative evidence summaries of these animal studies. Rating how certain we are about the evidence could provide important information about the translational probability of findings in experimental animal studies to clinical practice and probably improve it. Evidence summaries and certainty in the evidence ratings could also be used (1) to support selection of interventions with best therapeutic potential to be tested in clinical trials, (2) to justify a regulatory decision limiting human exposure (to drug or toxin), or to (3) support decisions on the utility of further animal experiments. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach is the most widely used framework to rate the certainty in the evidence and strength of health care recommendations. Here we present how the GRADE approach could be used to rate the certainty in the evidence of preclinical animal studies in the context of therapeutic interventions. We also discuss the methodological challenges that we identified, and for which further work is needed. Examples are defining the importance of consistency within and across animal species and using GRADE's indirectness domain as a tool to predict translation from animal models to humans.

AB  - It can be challenging to decide which evidence synthesis software to choose when doing a systematic review. This article discusses some of the important questions to consider in relation to the chosen method and synthesis approach. Software can support researchers in a range of ways. Here, a range of review conditions and software solutions. For example, facilitating contemporaneous collaboration across time and geographical space; in-built bias assessment tools; and line-by-line coding for qualitative textual analysis. EPPI-Reviewer is a review software for research synthesis managed by the EPPI-centre, UCL Institute of Education. EPPI-Reviewer has text mining automation technologies. Version 5 supports data sharing and re-use across the systematic review community. Open source software will soon be released. EPPI-Centre will continue to offer the software as a cloud-based service. The software is offered via a subscription with a one-month (extendible) trial available and volume discounts for 'site licences'. It is free to use for Cochrane and Campbell reviews. The next EPPI-Reviewer version is being built in collaboration with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence using 'surveillance' of newly published research to support 'living' iterative reviews. This is achieved using a combination of machine learning and traditional information retrieval technologies to identify the type of research each new publication describes and determine its relevance for a particular review, domain or guideline. While the amount of available knowledge and research is constantly increasing, the ways in which software can support the focus and relevance of data identification are also developing fast. Software advances are maximising the opportunities for the production of relevant and timely reviews.

AB  - Clear reporting of research is crucial to the scientific process. Poorly designed and reported studies are damaging not only to the efforts of individual researchers, but also to science as a whole. Standardised reporting methods, such as those already established for reporting randomised clinical trials, have led to improved study design and facilitated the processes of clinical systematic review and meta-analysis. Such standards were lacking in the pre-clinical field until the development of the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. These were prompted following a survey which highlighted a widespread lack of robust and consistent reporting of pre-clinical in vivo research, with reports frequently omitting basic information required for study replication and quality assessment. The resulting twenty item checklist in ARRIVE covers all aspects of experimental design with particular emphasis on bias reduction and methodological transparency. Influential publishers and research funders have already adopted ARRIVE. Further dissemination and acknowledgement of the importance of these guidelines is vital to their widespread implementation. Conclusions and implications Wide implementation of the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting of in vivo preclinical research, especially pain research, are essential for a much needed increased transparency and quality in publishing such research. ARRIVE will also positively influence improvements in experimental design and quality, assist the conduct of accurate replication studies of important new findings and facilitate meta-analyses of preclinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The continuous growth of the current dementia epidemic is contingent on the stability of age- and sex-specific trends over time. However, recent evidence suggests declining or stable trends. The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-world changes in the burden of dementia in older adults in Sweden from 1987 to 2016 by estimating age- and sex-specific incidence of dementia diagnosis in hospital inpatient records (dementia incidence). Differences in trends by sex, age, and educational levels were also examined. METHODS: The entire Swedish population aged 65 years and older was followed up from 1987 to 2016. Age-, sex-, and education-stratified dementia incidence rates for every follow-up year were estimated using the National Patient Register. Hazard ratio of receiving a dementia diagnosis in the inpatient records per 1 calendar year increase was estimated with discrete time logistic models with a complementary log-log link. RESULTS: After increase, especially in those >85 years of age, dementia incidence started to decrease in the last 5 years of the study period. After 2011, 1 calendar year increase was associated with lower hazard ratio of receiving a hospital diagnosis of dementia. The decrease had the highest magnitude in 70-74-year-olds (-5.5%), followed by 75-79-year-olds (-4.5%) and 80-84-year-olds (-4.0%). The decrease was present in both sexes and at all educational levels up to 90 years of age. Age was associated with the level of dementia incidence, and the trends differed by age group. Educational gradient was observed. University-educated older adults had the lowest rates of dementia. However, the trend over time did not substantially differ by sex or educational level. CONCLUSION: Our results provide more evidence that dementia incidence may be declining. They also suggest that at least in hospitals, the number of new patients with dementia may decrease in the future.

AB  - Neuronal death is the final step in the progression of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies into clinically evident AD and its profound dementia. As such, a drug candidate proposed to be effective in AD must successfully prevent neuronal losses. The lack of preclinical demonstrated abilities to prevent neuronal programmed cell death may explain the recent failure of 300-400 AD drug candidates, identify a flaw in the Amyloid Hypothesis, and a risk for subsequent drug candidate interventions against AD. We propose that investigators use either animal models or small early translational clinical trials to test for AD drug candidates' efficacy against clinically critical features of the disease, such as prevention of neuronal death. Such stringent testing would more effectively shelter AD patients from being recruited into clinical trials that are destined to fail in Phase II or III.

This report is a summary of the findings and recommendations of a meeting titled "Tackling gaps in developing life-changing treatments for dementia", hosted by Alzheimer's Research UK in May 2018. The aim of the meeting was to identify, review, and highlight the areas in dementia research that are not currently being addressed by existing initiatives. It reflects the views of leading experts in the field of neurodegeneration research challenged with developing a strategic action plan to address these gaps and make recommendations on how to achieve the G8 dementia summit goals. The plan calls for significant advances in (1) translating newly identified genetic risk factors into a better understanding of the impacted biological processes; (2) enhanced understanding of selective neuronal resilience to inform novel drug targets; (3) facilitating robust and reproducible drug-target validation; (4) appropriate and evidence-based selection of appropriate subjects for proof-of-concept clinical trials; (5) improving approaches to assess drug-target engagement in humans; and (6) innovative approaches in conducting clinical trials if we are able to detect disease 10-15 years earlier than we currently do today.

AB  - Microtubules (MTs) play a fundamental role in many vital processes such as cell division and neuronal activity. They are key structural and functional elements in axons, supporting neurite differentiation and growth, as well as transporting motor proteins along the axons, which use MTs as support tracks. Tau is a stabilizing MT associated protein, whose functions are mainly regulated by phosphorylation. A disruption of the MT network, which might be caused by Tau loss of function, is observed in a group of related diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau is found hyperphosphorylated in AD, which might account for its loss of MT stabilizing capacity. Since destabilization of MTs after dissociation of Tau could contribute to toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases, a molecular understanding of this interaction and its regulation is essential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning can assist with multiple tasks during systematic reviews to facilitate the rapid retrieval of relevant references during screening and to identify and extract information relevant to the study characteristics, which include the PICO elements of patient/population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes. The latter requires techniques for identifying and categorising fragments of text, known as named entity recognition. METHODS: A publicly available corpus of PICO annotations on biomedical abstracts is used to train a named entity recognition model, which is implemented as a recurrent neural network. This model is then applied to a separate collection of abstracts for references from systematic reviews within biomedical and health domains. The occurrences of words tagged in the context of specific PICO contexts are used as additional features for a relevancy classification model. Simulations of the machine learning-assisted screening are used to evaluate the work saved by the relevancy model with and without the PICO features. Chi-squared and statistical significance of positive predicted values are used to identify words that are more indicative of relevancy within PICO contexts. RESULTS: Inclusion of PICO features improves the performance metric on 15 of the 20 collections, with substantial gains on certain systematic reviews. Examples of words whose PICO context are more precise can explain this increase. CONCLUSIONS: Words within PICO tagged segments in abstracts are predictive features for determining inclusion. Combining PICO annotation model into the relevancy classification pipeline is a promising approach. The annotations may be useful on their own to aid users in pinpointing necessary information for data extraction, or to facilitate semantic search.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Systematic reviews (SRs) are time and resource intensive, requiring approximately 1 year from protocol registration to submission for publication. Our aim was to describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing the first 2-week full SR. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and narratively. RESULTS: The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9 workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16 person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461 person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis, data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory, attention, and decision process; environmental context and resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made, requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes, and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. CONCLUSION: A small and experienced systematic reviewer team using Systematic Review Automation tools who have protected time to focus solely on the SR can complete a moderately sized SR in 2 weeks.

AB  - The fourth meeting of the International Collaboration for Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR) was held 5-6 November 2019 in The Hague, the Netherlands. ICASR is an interdisciplinary group whose goal is to maximize the use of technology for conducting rapid, accurate, and efficient systematic reviews of scientific evidence. The group seeks to facilitate the development and acceptance of automated techniques for systematic reviews. In 2018, the major themes discussed were the transferability of automation tools (i.e., tools developed for other purposes that might be used by systematic reviewers), the automated recognition of study design in multiple disciplines and applications, and approaches for the evaluation of automation tools.

AB  - Background: Researchers in evidence-based medicine cannot keep up with the amounts of both old and newly published primary research articles. Support for the early stages of the systematic review process - searching and screening studies for eligibility - is necessary because it is currently impossible to search for relevant research with precision. Better automated data extraction may not only facilitate the stage of review traditionally labelled 'data extraction', but also change earlier phases of the review process by making it possible to identify relevant research. Exponential improvements in computational processing speed and data storage are fostering the development of data mining models and algorithms. This, in combination with quicker pathways to publication, led to a large landscape of tools and methods for data mining and extraction. Objective: To review published methods and tools for data extraction to (semi)automate the systematic reviewing process. Methods: We propose to conduct a living review. With this methodology we aim to do constant evidence surveillance, bi-monthly search updates, as well as review updates every 6 months if new evidence permits it. In a cross-sectional analysis we will extract methodological characteristics and assess the quality of reporting in our included papers. Conclusions: We aim to increase transparency in the reporting and assessment of automation technologies to the benefit of data scientists, systematic reviewers and funders of health research. This living review will help to reduce duplicate efforts by data scientists who develop data mining methods. It will also serve to inform systematic reviewers about possibilities to support their data extraction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data extraction forms link systematic reviews with primary research and provide the foundation for appraising, analysing, summarising and interpreting a body of evidence. This makes their development, pilot testing and use a crucial part of the systematic reviews process. Several studies have shown that data extraction errors are frequent in systematic reviews, especially regarding outcome data. METHODS: We reviewed guidance on the development and pilot testing of data extraction forms and the data extraction process. We reviewed four types of sources: 1) methodological handbooks of systematic review organisations (SRO); 2) textbooks on conducting systematic reviews; 3) method documents from health technology assessment (HTA) agencies and 4) journal articles. HTA documents were retrieved in February 2019 and database searches conducted in December 2019. One author extracted the recommendations and a second author checked them for accuracy. Results are presented descriptively. RESULTS: Our analysis includes recommendations from 25 documents: 4 SRO handbooks, 11 textbooks, 5 HTA method documents and 5 journal articles. Across these sources the most common recommendations on form development are to use customized or adapted standardised extraction forms (14/25); provide detailed instructions on their use (10/25); ensure clear and consistent coding and response options (9/25); plan in advance which data are needed (9/25); obtain additional data if required (8/25); and link multiple reports of the same study (8/25). The most frequent recommendations on piloting extractions forms are that forms should be piloted on a sample of studies (18/25); and that data extractors should be trained in the use of the forms (7/25). The most frequent recommendations on data extraction are that extraction should be conducted by at least two people (17/25); that independent parallel extraction should be used (11/25); and that procedures to resolve disagreements between data extractors should be in place (14/25). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest a lack of comprehensiveness of recommendations. This may be particularly problematic for less experienced reviewers. Limitations of our method are the scoping nature of the review and that we did not analyse internal documents of health technology agencies.

AB  - The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The decisions and processes that may compose a systematic search strategy have not been formally identified and categorized. This study aimed to (1) identify all decisions that could be made and processes that could be used in a systematic search strategy and (2) create a hierarchical framework of those decisions and processes. METHODS: The literature was searched for documents or guides on conducting a literature search for a systematic review or other evidence synthesis. The decisions or processes for locating studies were extracted from eligible documents and categorized into a structured hierarchical framework. Feedback from experts was sought to revise the framework. The framework was revised iteratively and tested using recently published literature on systematic searching. RESULTS: Guidance documents were identified from expert organizations and a search of the literature and Internet. Data were extracted from 74 eligible documents to form the initial framework. The framework was revised based on feedback from 9 search experts and further review and testing by the authors. The hierarchical framework consists of 119 decisions or processes sorted into 17 categories and arranged under 5 topics. These topics are "Skill of the searcher," "Selecting information to identify," "Searching the literature electronically," "Other ways to identify studies," and "Updating the systematic review." CONCLUSIONS: The work identifies and classifies the decisions and processes used in systematic searching. Future work can now focus on assessing and prioritizing research on the best methods for successfully identifying all eligible studies for a systematic review.

AB  - Background: The reliable and usable (semi)automation of data extraction can support the field of systematic review by reducing the workload required to gather information about the conduct and results of the included studies. This living systematic review examines published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies. Methods: We systematically and continually search MEDLINE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), arXiv, and the dblp computer science bibliography databases. Full text screening and data extraction are conducted within an open-source living systematic review application created for the purpose of this review. This iteration of the living review includes publications up to a cut-off date of 22 April 2020. Results: In total, 53 publications are included in this version of our review. Of these, 41 (77%) of the publications addressed extraction of data from abstracts, while 14 (26%) used full texts. A total of 48 (90%) publications developed and evaluated classifiers that used randomised controlled trials as the main target texts. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. A description of their datasets was provided by 49 publications (94%), but only seven (13%) made the data publicly available. Code was made available by 10 (19%) publications, and five (9%) implemented publicly available tools. Conclusions: This living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of systematic review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy data. The lack of publicly available gold-standard data for evaluation, and lack of application thereof, makes it difficult to draw conclusions on which is the best-performing system for each data extraction target. With this living review we aim to review the literature continually.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research on data extraction methods in systematic reviews has focused on single aspects of the process. We aimed to provide a deeper insight into these methods by analysing a current sample of reviews. METHODS: We included systematic reviews of health interventions in humans published in English. We analysed 75 Cochrane reviews from May and June 2020 and a random sample of non-Cochrane reviews published in the same period and retrieved from Medline. We linked reviews with protocols and study registrations. We collected information on preparing, piloting, and performing data extraction and on use of software to assist review conduct (automation tools). Data were extracted by one author, with 20% extracted in duplicate. Data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: Of the 152 included reviews, 77 reported use of a standardized extraction form (51%); 42 provided information on the type of form used (28%); 24 on piloting (16%); 58 on what data was collected (38%); 133 on the extraction method (88%); 107 on resolving disagreements (70%); 103 on methods to obtain additional data or information (68%); 52 on procedures to avoid data errors (34%); and 47 on methods to deal with multiple study reports (31%). Items were more frequently reported in Cochrane than non-Cochrane reviews. The data extraction form used was published in 10 reviews (7%). Use of software was rarely reported except for statistical analysis software and use of RevMan and GRADEpro GDT in Cochrane reviews. Covidence was the most frequent automation tool used: 18 reviews used it for study selection (12%) and 9 for data extraction (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of data extraction methods in systematic reviews is limited, especially in non-Cochrane reviews. This includes core items of data extraction such as methods used to manage disagreements. Few reviews currently use software to assist data extraction and review conduct. Our results can serve as a baseline to assess the uptake of such tools in future analyses.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory deficits accompanied by synaptic and metabolic deficits, namely of mitochondrial function. AD patients also display a disrupted circadian pattern. Thus, we now compared memory performance, synaptic plasticity, and mitochondria function in 24-week-old non-transgenic (non-Tg) and triple transgenic male mice modeling AD (3xTg-AD) at Zeitgeber 04 (ZT-4, inactive phase) and ZT-16 (active phase). Using the Morris water maze test to minimize the influence of circadian-associated locomotor activity, we observed a circadian variation in hippocampus-dependent learning performance in non-Tg mice, which was impaired in 3xTg-AD mice. 3xTg-AD mice also displayed a lack of circadian variation of their performance in the reversal spatial learning task. Additionally, the amplitude of hippocampal long-term potentiation also exhibited a circadian profile in non-Tg mice, which was not observed in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, cerebral cortical synaptosomes of non-Tg mice also displayed a circadian variation of FCCP-stimulated oxygen consumption as well as in mitochondrial calcium retention that were blunted in 3xTg-AD mice. In sum, this multidimensional study shows that the ability to maintain a circadian oscillation in brain behavior, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic mitochondria function are simultaneously impaired in 3xTg-AD mice, highlighting the effects of circadian misalignment in AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews (SRs) are central to evaluating therapies but have high costs in terms of both time and money. Many software tools exist to assist with SRs, but most tools do not support the full process, and transparency and replicability of SR depend on performing and presenting evidence according to established best practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a basis for comparing and selecting between web-based software tools that support SR, by conducting a feature-by-feature comparison of SR tools. METHODS: We searched for SR tools by reviewing any such tool listed in the SR Toolbox, previous reviews of SR tools, and qualitative Google searching. We included all SR tools that were currently functional and required no coding, and excluded reference managers, desktop applications, and statistical software. The list of features to assess was populated by combining all features assessed in 4 previous reviews of SR tools; we also added 5 features (manual addition, screening automation, dual extraction, living review, and public outputs) that were independently noted as best practices or enhancements of transparency and replicability. Then, 2 reviewers assigned binary present or absent assessments to all SR tools with respect to all features, and a third reviewer adjudicated all disagreements. RESULTS: Of the 53 SR tools found, 55% (29/53) were excluded, leaving 45% (24/53) for assessment. In total, 30 features were assessed across 6 classes, and the interobserver agreement was 86.46%. DistillerSR (Evidence Partners; 26/30, 87%), Nested Knowledge (Nested Knowledge; 25/30, 83%), and EPPI-Reviewer Web (EPPI-Centre; 24/30, 80%) support the most features followed by Giotto Compliance (Giotto Compliance; 23/30, 77%), LitStream (ICF), and SRDB.PRO (VTS Software). Fewer than half of all the features assessed are supported by 7 tools: RobotAnalyst (National Centre for Text Mining), SRDR (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), SyRF (Systematic Review Facility), Data Abstraction Assistant (Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health), SR Accelerator (Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare), RobotReviewer (RobotReviewer), and COVID-NMA (COVID-NMA). Notably, of the 24 tools, only 10 (42%) support direct search, only 7 (29%) offer dual extraction, and only 13 (54%) offer living/updatable reviews. CONCLUSIONS: DistillerSR, Nested Knowledge, and EPPI-Reviewer Web each offer a high density of SR-focused web-based tools. By transparent comparison and discussion regarding SR tool functionality, the medical community can both choose among existing software offerings and note the areas of growth needed, most notably in the support of living reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To produce a systematic review (SR), reviewers typically screen thousands of titles and abstracts of articles manually to find a small number which are read in full text to find relevant articles included in the final SR. Here, we evaluate a proposed automated probabilistic publication type screening strategy applied to the randomized controlled trial (RCT) articles (i.e., those which present clinical outcome results of RCT studies) included in a corpus of previously published Cochrane reviews. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected a random subset of 558 published Cochrane reviews that specified RCT study only inclusion criteria, containing 7113 included articles which could be matched to PubMed identifiers. These were processed by our automated RCT Tagger tool to estimate the probability that each article reports clinical outcomes of a RCT. RESULTS: Removing articles with low predictive scores P < 0.01 eliminated 288 included articles, of which only 22 were actually typical RCT articles, and only 18 were actually typical RCT articles that MEDLINE indexed as such. Based on our sample set, this screening strategy led to fewer than 0.05 relevant RCT articles being missed on average per Cochrane SR. DISCUSSION: This scenario, based on real SRs, demonstrates that automated tagging can identify RCT articles accurately while maintaining very high recall. However, we also found that even SRs whose inclusion criteria are restricted to RCT studies include not only clinical outcome articles per se, but a variety of ancillary article types as well. CONCLUSIONS: This encourages further studies learning how best to incorporate automated tagging of additional publication types into SR triage workflows.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automation is a proposed solution for the increasing difficulty of maintaining up-to-date, high-quality health evidence. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of semiautomated data synthesis, such as risk-of-bias (RoB) assessments, is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether RobotReviewer-assisted RoB assessments are noninferior in accuracy and efficiency to assessments conducted with human effort only. DESIGN: Two-group, parallel, noninferiority, randomized trial. (Monash Research Office Project 11256). SETTING: Health-focused systematic reviews using Covidence. PARTICIPANTS: Systematic reviewers, who had not previously used RobotReviewer, completing Cochrane RoB assessments between February 2018 and May 2020. INTERVENTION: In the intervention group, reviewers received an RoB form prepopulated by RobotReviewer; in the comparison group, reviewers received a blank form. Studies were assigned in a 1:1 ratio via simple randomization to receive RobotReviewer assistance for either Reviewer 1 or Reviewer 2. Participants were blinded to study allocation before starting work on each RoB form. MEASUREMENTS: Co-primary outcomes were the accuracy of individual reviewer RoB assessments and the person-time required to complete individual assessments. Domain-level RoB accuracy was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 15 recruited review teams, 7 completed the trial (145 included studies). Integration of RobotReviewer resulted in noninferior overall RoB assessment accuracy (risk difference, -0.014 [95% CI, -0.093 to 0.065]; intervention group: 88.8% accurate assessments; control group: 90.2% accurate assessments). Data were inconclusive for the person-time outcome (RobotReviewer saved 1.40 minutes [CI, -5.20 to 2.41 minutes]). LIMITATION: Variability in user behavior and a limited number of assessable reviews led to an imprecise estimate of the time outcome. CONCLUSION: In health-related systematic reviews, RoB assessments conducted with RobotReviewer assistance are noninferior in accuracy to those conducted without RobotReviewer assistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the application and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for automated medical literature screening for systematic reviews. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library to identify potentially relevant studies. We included studies in automated literature screening that reported study question, source of dataset, and developed algorithm models for literature screening. The literature screening results by human investigators were considered to be the reference standard. Quantitative synthesis of the accuracy was conducted using a bivariate model. RESULTS: Eighty-six studies were included in our systematic review and 17 studies were further included for meta-analysis. The combined recall, specificity, and precision were 0.928 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.878-0.958], 0.647 (95% CI, 0.442-0.809), and 0.200 (95% CI, 0.135-0.287) when achieving maximized recall, but were 0.708 (95% CI, 0.570-0.816), 0.921 (95% CI, 0.824-0.967), and 0.461 (95% CI, 0.375-0.549) when achieving maximized precision in the AI models. No significant difference was found in recall among subgroup analyses including the algorithms, the number of screened literatures, and the fraction of included literatures. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis study showed that the recall is more important than the specificity or precision in literature screening, and a recall over 0.95 should be prioritized. We recommend to report the effectiveness indices of automatic algorithms separately. At the current stage manual literature screening is still indispensable for medical systematic reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the automated abstract screening tool Rayyan. METHODS: The records obtained from the search for three systematic reviews were manually screened in four stages. At the end of each stage, Rayyan was used to predict the eligibility score for the remaining records. At two different thresholds (≤2.5 and < 2.5 for exclusion of a record) Rayyan-generated ratings were compared with the decisions made by human reviewers in the manual screening process and the tool's accuracy metrics were calculated. RESULTS: Two thousand fifty-four records were screened manually, of which 379 were judged to be eligible for full-text assessment, and 112 were eventually included in the final review. For finding records eligible for full-text assessment, at the threshold of < 2.5 for exclusion, Rayyan managed to achieve sensitivity values of 97-99% with specificity values of 19-58%, while at the threshold of ≤2.5 for exclusion it had a specificity of 100% with sensitivity values of 1-29%. For the task of finding eligible reports for inclusion in the final review, almost similar results were obtained. DISCUSSION: At the threshold of < 2.5 for exclusion, Rayyan managed to be a reliable tool for excluding ineligible records, but it was not much reliable for finding eligible records. We emphasize that this study was conducted on diagnostic test accuracy reviews, which are more difficult to screen due to inconsistent terminology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine propagates that medical/clinical decisions are made by taking into account high-quality evidence, most notably in the form of randomized clinical trials. Evidence-based decision-making requires aggregating the evidence available in multiple trials to reach -by means of systematic reviews- a conclusive recommendation on which treatment is best suited for a given patient population. However, it is challenging to produce systematic reviews to keep up with the ever-growing number of published clinical trials. Therefore, new computational approaches are necessary to support the creation of systematic reviews that include the most up-to-date evidence.We propose a method to synthesize the evidence available in clinical trials in an ad-hoc and on-demand manner by automatically arranging such evidence in the form of a hierarchical argument that recommends a therapy as being superior to some other therapy along a number of key dimensions corresponding to the clinical endpoints of interest. The method has also been implemented as a web tool that allows users to explore the effects of excluding different points of evidence, and indicating relative preferences on the endpoints. RESULTS: Through two use cases, our method was shown to be able to generate conclusions similar to the ones of published systematic reviews. To evaluate our method implemented as a web tool, we carried out a survey and usability analysis with medical professionals. The results show that the tool was perceived as being valuable, acknowledging its potential to inform clinical decision-making and to complement the information from existing medical guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented is a simple but yet effective argumentation-based method that contributes to support the synthesis of clinical trial evidence. A current limitation of the method is that it relies on a manually populated knowledge base. This problem could be alleviated by deploying natural language processing methods to extract the relevant information from publications.

AB  - In area CA1 of hippocampal slices which are allowed to recover from slicing “in interface” and where recordings are carried out in interface, a single 1-sec train of 100-Hz stimulation triggers a short-lasting long-term potentiation (S-LTP), which lasts 1–2 h, whereas multiple 1-sec trains induce a long-lasting LTP (L-LTP), which lasts several hours. Moreover, the threshold and the features of these LTP depend on the history of the neurons, a phenomenon known as metaplasticity. Here, where all recordings were performed in interface, we found that allowing the slices to recover “in submersion” had dramatic metaplastic effects. In these conditions, a single 1-sec train at 100 Hz induced an L-LTP which lasted at least 4 h and was dependent on protein synthesis. Interestingly, this type of metaplasticity was observed when the concentration of Mg(++) used was 1.0 mM but not when it was 1.3 mM. The LTP induced by four 1-sec trains at 100 Hz was similar whatever the incubation method. However, the signaling cascades recruited to achieve that pattern were different. In the interface–interface paradigm (recovery and recording both in interface) the four-train induced LTP recruited the PKA signaling pathway but not that of the p42/44MAPK. On the contrary, in the submersion–interface paradigm the four-train induced LTP recruited the p42/44MAPK signaling pathway but not that of the PKA. To our knowledge this is the first example of metaplasticity involving the recruitment of signaling cascades in LTP.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the possible circadian regulation of hippocampal excitability and long-term potentiation (LTP) measured by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals (SC) and recording the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) from the CA1 dendritic layer or the population spike (PS) from the soma in brain slices of C3H and C57 mice. These 2 strains of mice were of interest because the C3H mice secrete melatonin rhythmically while the C57 mice do not. The authors found that the magnitude of the enhancement of the PS was significantly greater in LTP recorded from night slices compared to day slices of both C3H and C57 mice. They also found significant diurnal variation in the decay of LTP measured with fEPSPs, with the decay slower during the night in both strains of mice. There was evidence for a diurnal rhythm in the input/output function of pyramidal neurons measured at the soma in C57 but not C3H mice. Furthermore, LTP in the PS, measured in slices prepared during the day but recorded during the night, had a profile remarkably similar to the night group. Finally, PS recordings were carried out in slices from C3H mice maintained in constant darkness prior to experimentation. Again, the authors found that the magnitude of the enhancement of the PS was significantly greater in LTP recorded from subjective night slices compared to subjective day slices. These results provide the 1st evidence that an endogenous circadian oscillator modulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudoreplication occurs when observations are not statistically independent, but treated as if they are. This can occur when there are multiple observations on the same subjects, when samples are nested or hierarchically organised, or when measurements are correlated in time or space. Analysis of such data without taking these dependencies into account can lead to meaningless results, and examples can easily be found in the neuroscience literature. RESULTS: A single issue of Nature Neuroscience provided a number of examples and is used as a case study to highlight how pseudoreplication arises in neuroscientific studies, why the analyses in these papers are incorrect, and appropriate analytical methods are provided. 12% of papers had pseudoreplication and a further 36% were suspected of having pseudoreplication, but it was not possible to determine for certain because insufficient information was provided. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudoreplication can undermine the conclusions of a statistical analysis, and it would be easier to detect if the sample size, degrees of freedom, the test statistic, and precise p-values are reported. This information should be a requirement for all publications.

AB  - The global prevalence of dementia is estimated to be as high as 24 million, and is predicted to double every 20 years through to 2040, leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, which typically begins with deterioration in memory. Before death, individuals with this disorder have usually become dependent on caregivers. The neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques—which are frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites—and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies are often accompanied by the presence of reactive microgliosis and the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying the neuropathological changes in AD remain unclear, but are probably affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we provide an overview of the criteria used in the diagnosis of AD, highlighting how this disease is related to, but distinct from, normal aging. We also summarize current information relating to AD prevalence, incidence and risk factors, and review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, which typically begins with deterioration in memory. Before death, individuals with this disorder have usually become dependent on caregivers. The neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques—which are frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites—and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies are often accompanied by the presence of reactive microgliosis and the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying the neuropathological changes in AD remain unclear, but are probably affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we provide an overview of the criteria used in the diagnosis of AD, highlighting how this disease is related to, but distinct from, normal aging. We also summarize current information relating to AD prevalence, incidence and risk factors, and review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a type of synaptic plasticity characterized by an increase in synaptic strength and believed to be involved in memory encoding. LTP elicited in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices has been extensively studied. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance phase of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This could be partly due to the various experimental conditions used by different laboratories. Indeed, the maintenance phase of LTP is strongly dependent on external parameters like oxygenation, temperature and humidity. It is also dependent on internal parameters like orientation of the slicing plane and slice viability after dissection. The optimization of all these parameters enables the induction of a very reproducible and very stable long-term potentiation. This methodology offers the possibility to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the stable increase in synaptic strength in hippocampal slices. It also highlights the importance of experimental conditions in in vitro investigation of neurophysiological phenomena.

AB  - ► An intense tetanus causes a depression of hippocampal fEPSPs at low test intensities. ► An intense tetanus yields less LTP than a moderate tetanus at higher test intensities. ► Local changes at the stimulation site are likely to underlie these effects. ► In vivo, tetanus currents >500 μA should be avoided; 250–500 μA is probably optimal.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Randomization, allocation concealment, and blind outcome assessment have been shown to reduce bias in human studies. Authors from the Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) collaboration recently found that these features protect against bias in animal stroke studies. We extended the scope the work from CAMARADES to include investigations of treatments for any condition. METHODS: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews. We searched Medline and Embase for systematic reviews of animal studies testing any intervention (against any control) and we included any disease area and outcome. We included reviews comparing randomized versus not randomized (but otherwise controlled), concealed versus unconcealed treatment allocation, or blinded versus unblinded outcome assessment. RESULTS: Thirty-one systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria: 20 investigated treatments for experimental stroke, 4 reviews investigated treatments for spinal cord diseases, while 1 review each investigated treatments for bone cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, glioma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and treatments used in emergency medicine. In our sample 29% of studies reported randomization, 15% of studies reported allocation concealment, and 35% of studies reported blinded outcome assessment. We pooled the results in a meta-analysis, and in our primary analysis found that failure to randomize significantly increased effect sizes, whereas allocation concealment and blinding did not. In our secondary analyses we found that randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding reduced effect sizes, especially where outcomes were subjective. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the need for randomization, allocation concealment, and blind outcome assessment in animal research across a wide range of outcomes and disease areas. Since human studies are often justified based on results from animal studies, our results suggest that unduly biased animal studies should not be allowed to constitute part of the rationale for human trials.

AB  - For decades, neurophysiologists have characterized the biophysical properties of a rich diversity of neuron types. However, identifying common features and computational roles shared across neuron types is made more difficult by inconsistent conventions for collecting and reporting biophysical data. Here, we leverage NeuroElectro, a literature-based database of electrophysiological properties (www.neuroelectro.org), to better understand neuronal diversity, both within and across neuron types, and the confounding influences of methodological variability. We show that experimental conditions (e.g., electrode types, recording temperatures, or animal age) can explain a substantial degree of the literature-reported biophysical variability observed within a neuron type. Critically, accounting for experimental metadata enables massive cross-study data normalization and reveals that electrophysiological data are far more reproducible across laboratories than previously appreciated. Using this normalized dataset, we find that neuron types throughout the brain cluster by biophysical properties into six to nine superclasses. These classes include intuitive clusters, such as fast-spiking basket cells, as well as previously unrecognized clusters, including a novel class of cortical and olfactory bulb interneurons that exhibit persistent activity at theta-band frequencies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration of brain regions that are crucial for learning and memory. Although intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques, composed of insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, have been the hallmarks of postmortem AD brains, memory impairment in early AD correlates better with pathological accumulation of soluble Aβ oligomers and persistent weakening of excitatory synaptic strength, which is demonstrated by inhibition of long-term potentiation, enhancement of long-term depression, and loss of synapses. However, current, approved interventions aiming to reduce Aβ levels have failed to retard disease progression; this has led to a pressing need to identify and target alternative pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Recently, it has been suggested that the disruption of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in AD is due to aberrant metaplasticity, which is a form of homeostatic plasticity that tunes the magnitude and direction of future synaptic plasticity based on previous neuronal or synaptic activity. This review examines emerging evidence for aberrant metaplasticity in AD. Putative mechanisms underlying aberrant metaplasticity in AD will also be discussed. We hope this review inspires future studies to test the extent to which these mechanisms contribute to the etiology of AD and offer therapeutic targets.

AB  - Incomplete reporting of study methods and results has become a focal point for failures in the reproducibility and translation of findings from preclinical research. Here we demonstrate that incomplete reporting of preclinical research is not limited to a few elements of research design, but rather is a broader problem that extends to the reporting of the methods and results. We evaluated 47 preclinical research studies from a systematic review of acute lung injury that use mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a treatment. We operationalized the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) reporting guidelines for pre-clinical studies into 109 discrete reporting sub-items and extracted 5,123 data elements. Overall, studies reported less than half (47%) of all sub-items (median 51 items; range 37–64). Across all studies, the Methods Section reported less than half (45%) and the Results Section reported less than a third (29%). There was no association between journal impact factor and completeness of reporting, which suggests that incomplete reporting of preclinical research occurs across all journals regardless of their perceived prestige. Incomplete reporting of methods and results will impede attempts to replicate research findings and maximize the value of preclinical studies.

AB  - The evolving healthcare environment demands optimally measured quality of care. Performance measures are increasingly being used for quality improvement, public reporting, and re-imbursement determinations. The National Quality Forum has created rigorous criteria for the evaluation of potential performance measures across medical fields. The Heart Rhythm Society has championed the development of four separate EP specific performance measures: implantable cardioverter defibrillator complication rate, cardiac tamponade and/or pericardiocentesis following atrial fibrillation ablation, infection within 180 days of a cardiac implantable electronic device implantation, replacement, or revision, and in-person evaluation following a cardiac implantable electronic device implantation. National registries serve a key role in developing performance measures and facilitating quality improvement, particularly as they provide improved granularity and accuracy of data compared with administrative claims data. All performance measures demand continued reassessment as technology and performance gaps change and as unintended consequences may arise.

AB  - Neuron types (e.g., pyramidal cells) within one area of the brain are often considered homogeneous, despite variability in their biophysical properties. Here we review literature demonstrating variability in the electrical activity of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells (PCs), including responses to somatic current injection, synaptic stimulation, and spontaneous network-related activity. In addition, we describe how responses of CA1 PCs vary with development, experience, and aging, and some of the underlying ionic currents responsible. Finally, we suggest directions that may be the most impactful in expanding this knowledge, including the use of text and data mining to systematically study cellular heterogeneity in more depth; dynamical systems theory to understand and potentially classify neuron firing patterns; and mathematical modeling to study the interaction between cellular properties and network output. Our goals are to provide a synthesis of the literature for experimentalists studying CA1 PCs, to give theorists an idea of the rich diversity of behaviors models may need to reproduce to accurately represent these cells, and to provide suggestions for future research.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with deficits in cognition and synaptic plasticity. While accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hyper-phosphorylation of tau are parts of the etiology, AD can be caused by a large number of different genetic mutations and other unknown factors. Considering such a heterogeneous nature of AD, it would be desirable to develop treatment strategies that can improve memory irrespective of the individual causes. Reducing the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) was shown to enhance long-term memory and synaptic plasticity in naïve mice. Moreover, hyper-phosphorylation of eIF2α is observed in the brains of postmortem AD patients. Therefore, regulating eIF2α phosphorylation can be a plausible candidate for restoring memory in AD by targeting memory-enhancing mechanism. In this study, we examined whether PKR inhibition can rescue synaptic and learning deficits in two different AD mouse models; 5XFAD transgenic and Aβ(1–42)-injected mice. We found that the acute treatment of PKR inhibitor (PKRi) can restore the deficits in long-term memory and long-term potentiation (LTP) in both mouse models without affecting the Aβ load in the hippocampus. Our results prove the principle that targeting memory enhancing mechanisms can be a valid candidate for developing AD treatment.

AB  - SIMPLE SUMMARY: Several fraud cases, widespread failure to replicate or reproduce seminal findings, and pervasive error in the scientific literature have led to a crisis of confidence in the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. In this review, the author discusses some of the core findings that point at weak spots in contemporary science and considers the human factors that underlie them. He delves into the human tendencies that create errors and biases in data collection, analyses, and reporting of research results. He presents several solutions to deal with observer bias, publication bias, the researcher’s tendency to exploit degrees of freedom in their analysis of data, low statistical power, and errors in the reporting of results, with a focus on the specific challenges in animal welfare research. ABSTRACT: In this review, the author discusses several of the weak spots in contemporary science, including scientific misconduct, the problems of post hoc hypothesizing (HARKing), outcome switching, theoretical bloopers in formulating research questions and hypotheses, selective reading of the literature, selective citing of previous results, improper blinding and other design failures, p-hacking or researchers’ tendency to analyze data in many different ways to find positive (typically significant) results, errors and biases in the reporting of results, and publication bias. The author presents some empirical results highlighting problems that lower the trustworthiness of reported results in scientific literatures, including that of animal welfare studies. Some of the underlying causes of these biases are discussed based on the notion that researchers are only human and hence are not immune to confirmation bias, hindsight bias, and minor ethical transgressions. The author discusses solutions in the form of enhanced transparency, sharing of data and materials, (post-publication) peer review, pre-registration, registered reports, improved training, reporting guidelines, replication, dealing with publication bias, alternative inferential techniques, power, and other statistical tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several scales, checklists and domain-based tools for assessing risk of reporting biases exist, but it is unclear how much they vary in content and guidance. We conducted a systematic review of the content and measurement properties of such tools. METHODS: We searched for potentially relevant articles in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO and Google Scholar from inception to February 2017. One author screened all titles, abstracts and full text articles, and collected data on tool characteristics. RESULTS: We identified 18 tools that include an assessment of the risk of reporting bias. Tools varied in regard to the type of reporting bias assessed (eg, bias due to selective publication, bias due to selective non-reporting), and the level of assessment (eg, for the study as a whole, a particular result within a study or a particular synthesis of studies). Various criteria are used across tools to designate a synthesis as being at ‘high’ risk of bias due to selective publication (eg, evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, use of non-comprehensive searches). However, the relative weight assigned to each criterion in the overall judgement is unclear for most of these tools. Tools for assessing risk of bias due to selective non-reporting guide users to assess a study, or an outcome within a study, as ‘high’ risk of bias if no results are reported for an outcome. However, assessing the corresponding risk of bias in a synthesis that is missing the non-reported outcomes is outside the scope of most of these tools. Inter-rater agreement estimates were available for five tools. CONCLUSION: There are several limitations of existing tools for assessing risk of reporting biases, in terms of their scope, guidance for reaching risk of bias judgements and measurement properties. Development and evaluation of a new, comprehensive tool could help overcome present limitations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The harm benefit analysis (HBA) is the cornerstone of animal research regulation and is considered to be a key ethical safeguard for animals. The HBA involves weighing the anticipated benefits of animal research against its predicted harms to animals but there are doubts about how objective and accountable this process is. OBJECTIVES: i. To explore the harms to animals involved in pre-clinical animal studies and to assess these against the benefits for humans accruing from these studies; ii. To test the feasibility of conducting this type of retrospective HBA. METHODS: Data on harms were systematically extracted from a sample of pre-clinical animal studies whose clinical relevance had already been investigated by comparing systematic reviews of the animal studies with systematic reviews of human studies for the same interventions (antifibrinolytics for haemorrhage, bisphosphonates for osteoporosis, corticosteroids for brain injury, Tirilazad for stroke, antenatal corticosteroids for neonatal respiratory distress and thrombolytics for stroke). Clinical relevance was also explored in terms of current clinical practice. Harms were categorised for severity using an expert panel. The quality of the research and its impact were considered. Bateson’s Cube was used to conduct the HBA. RESULTS: The most common assessment of animal harms by the expert panel was ‘severe’. Reported use of analgesia was rare and some animals (including most neonates) endured significant procedures with no, or only light, anaesthesia reported. Some animals suffered iatrogenic harms. Many were kept alive for long periods post-experimentally but only 1% of studies reported post-operative care. A third of studies reported that some animals died prior to endpoints. All the studies were of poor quality. Having weighed the actual harms to animals against the actual clinical benefits accruing from these studies, and taking into account the quality of the research and its impact, less than 7% of the studies were permissible according to Bateson’s Cube: only the moderate bisphosphonate studies appeared to minimise harms to animals whilst being associated with benefit for humans. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the accountability of the HBA has been systematically explored across a range of pre-clinical animal studies. The regulatory systems in place when these studies were conducted failed to safeguard animals from severe suffering or to ensure that only beneficial, scientifically rigorous research was conducted. Our findings indicate a pressing need to: i. review regulations, particularly those that permit animals to suffer severe harms; ii. reform the processes of prospectively assessing pre-clinical animal studies to make them fit for purpose; and iii. systematically evaluate the benefits of pre-clinical animal research to permit a more realistic assessment of its likely future benefits.

AB  - Millions of people worldwide currently suffer from serious neurological diseases and injuries for which there are few, and often no, effective treatments. The paucity of effective interventions is, no doubt, due in large part to the complexity of the disorders, as well as our currently limited understanding of their pathophysiology. The bleak picture for patients, however, is also attributable to avoidable impediments stemming from quality concerns in preclinical research that often escape detection by research regulation efforts. In our essay, we connect the dots between these concerns about the quality of preclinical research and their potential ethical impact on the patients who volunteer for early trials of interventions informed by it. We do so in hopes that a greater appreciation among preclinical researchers of these serious ethical consequences can lead to a greater commitment within the research community to adopt widely available tools and measures that can help to improve the quality of research.
