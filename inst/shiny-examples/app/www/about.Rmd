# About

<img src="updated_logo.png" align="right" width="142"/>

ASySD was developed in the [CAMARADES](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/research/camarades/about-camarades) research group at the University of Edinburgh by Kaitlyn Hair. By comparing metadata fields in existing in-house systematic search datasets, rule-based match criteria were iteratively developed to identify duplicate citations with a high degree of accuracy. Once developed, ASySD was evaluated on 5 unseen biomedical systematic review datasets of varying sizes (\~1800 to \~80,000 citations). Using ASySD's automated deduplication approach was highly sensitive, capturing over 95% of citations, and highly specific with a very low false positive rate of \<0.2%.

# Packages ASySD uses

The data import functionality within ASySD uses the [synthesisr](https://github.com/mjwestgate/synthesisr) package, created by Martin Westgate and the [RefManageR](https://docs.ropensci.org/RefManageR/authors.html#citation) package, created by Mathew W. McLean. The record matching function underlying this tool uses the [**RecordLinkage**](https://rdrr.io/cran/RecordLinkage/) package, created by Murat Sariyar and Andreas Borg.
