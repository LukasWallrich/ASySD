# Manual deduplication

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Flagging studies

If you wish to manually check potential duplicate studies [outside of the ASySD app]{.underline}, you can flag them and go through them in a reference manager or in excel.

To do this, highlight studies of interest and click the *flag selected pairs* button. Alternatively, if you want to flag all pairs, there is a button to do this. Notice that a flag icon will appear in the study table to indicate that a pair has been flagged. Depending on the export type, the flags will appear differently in the output - check the export options on the Download page for more information.

## Removing studies

If you want to remove additional duplicates within ASySD, select all rows which contain duplicate pairs and click the *remove duplicates* button to remove them. The table will automatically update to present the remaining duplicate pairs to be assessed. Once you have removed rows with true duplicate pairs, you can move on to downloading the final results. Please note that the total number of removed studies **may not always correspond directly to the number of rows removed** - this is due to the same citation matching multiple times across different rows.
