# Uploading studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recommendations

We recommend first uploading your systematic search to a reference manager such as Endnote or Zotero before uploading to ASySD. The app currently supports uploading files directly from PubMed and Web of Science but this feature has not yet been tested exhaustively.

## Endnote

If you use Endnote for reference management, you have several options to export your files for upload to ASySD. Highlight citations within Endnote, then click File \> Export and save as type

1.  **XML** (.xml) with Output Style set to Endnote Export.

2.  Text File (.txt) with Output Style set to **Tab Delimited.**

3.  Text File (.txt) with Output Style set to RefMan **RIS** Export.

4.  Text File (.txt) with Output Style set to **BibTeX** Export.

## Zotero

If you use Zotero for reference management, you have several options to export your files for upload to ASySD. Highlight citations within Zotero, then right click \> select Export Items \> set format to

1.  Endnote **XML**, leave other options as default and click OK to export the file.

2.  **RIS**, leave other options as default and click OK to export the file.

3.  **BibTeX**, leave other options as default and click OK to export the file.

4.  **CSV**, leave other options as default and click OK to export the file. NB: you will need to select Zotero CSV (rather than CSV) to upload this file format.

## Mendeley

If you use Mendeley for reference management, there is only one currently accepted export option. Highlight citations within Mendeley, then click to export to a **RIS file** which can then be uploaded to ASySD.

## Excel

Within excel, ensure your citation data has the following columns:

-   record_id

-   author

-   year

-   journal

-   doi

-   volume

-   number

-   pages

-   abstract

-   label

-   source

Click File \> save as CSV file. NB: Some columns can be blank, but as much metadata as possible will aid deduplication accuracy.

## Direct from database

Accepted imports:

-   Web of Science **RIS** export

-   Web of Science **BibTex** export

-   PubMed **BibText** export
