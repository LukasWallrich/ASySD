\arguments{
\item{raw_citations}{A dataframe containing duplicate ciations}

\item{manual_dedup}{Logical value. Do you want to retrieve dataframe for manual deduplication?}

\item{merge_citations}{Logical value. Do you want to merge matching citations?}

\item{keep_source}{Character vector. Selected citation source to preferentially retain in the dataset as the unique record}

\item{keep_label}{Selected citation label to preferentially retain in the dataset as the unique record}

\item{extra_merge_fields}{Add additional fields to merge, output will be similar to the label, source, and record_id columns with commas between each merged value}

\item{show_unknown_tags}{When a label, source, or other merged field is missing, do you want this to show as "unknown"?}

\item{user_input}{Do you want to proceed if important columns are missing? 1-yes; 2-no}
